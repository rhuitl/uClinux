@deftypefun {int} {pr29_8z} (const char * @var{in})
@var{in}:  zero terminated input UTF-8 string.

Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
NFKC specifications.

@strong{Return value:}  Returns PR29_SUCCESS on success, PR29_PROBLEM if the
input sequence is a "problem sequence" (i.e., may be normalized
into different strings by different implementations), or
PR29_STRINGPREP_ERROR if there was a problem converting the
string from UTF-8 to UCS-4.
