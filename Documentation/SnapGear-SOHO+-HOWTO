SnapGear SOHO+ HOWTO
--------------------

The SnapGear/SOHO+ router product is based on the Motorola 5307 ColdFire
processor. You use the standard uClinux m68k-elf tool chain for them.

You can build either linux-2.0.x or linux-2.4.x kernels. Choose the
uC-libc library.

To load images into the flash you can use the firmware upgrade option of
the web pages, or you can load it from the command line using:

    netflash A.B.C.D imagez.bin

Where A.B.C.D is the address of your TFTP server holding the generated
imagez.bin file.
