automake.inc provides a simple mechanism for downloading/patching/building
and installing packages within the uClinux-dist framework.

How to use it is documented below by example.

Using this build system requires a working net connection (at least for the
first time you turn on a package in the build).  All downloaded files will
be stored in ~/.downloads. If you want to share downloads to save bandwidth
or time you can copy this directory or mount it as a shared filesystem.  It
is just a directory of files.

For this example we will work through the steps needed to add a package
called "mypkg":

1) Create user/mypkg

2) Add user/mypkg/Makefile

      URL = http://mypkg.net/downloads/mypkg-1.2.tar.gz
      include $(ROOTDIR)/tools/automake.inc

   or if you want to build more than one package:

      mkpkg-1.2_URL   = http://mypkg.net/downloads/mypkg-1.2.tar.gz
      yourpkg-2.3_URL = http://yourpkg.net/downloads/yourpkg-2.3.tar.gz

      AUTOMAKE_y = mypkg-1.2 yourpkg-2.3

      include $(ROOTDIR)/tools/automake.inc

3) Put your patches in user/mypkg/patches/.

   Patches can be of the form:

      mypkg-1.2-fix-strcpy.patch
      mypkg-1.2-more-fixes.patch

   or in quilt format with a "series" files listing the patches in the order
   the need to be applied.

   Patches should apply with -p1 from the top directory in the extracted
   tarball.

4) Run "make oldconfig" which will let you enable your new application in
   the build.

5) try building ;-),  if you have already built a full tree you can just
   run:

      make user/mypkg_only

   or run "make" from the top level.

6) Customising your new package.

   Extra variables you can add to your makefile to customise how the package
   is built,  followed by an example.

   <pkg>_CONFOPTS - configure options needed to build package

      mypkg-1.2_CONFOPTS = --with-installed-zlib

   <pkg>_CONFVARS - env vars passed to configure to override settings

      mypkg-1.2_CONFVARS = ac_cv_func_posix_getpwuid_r=yes

   <pkg>_CFLAGS   - CFLAGS needed to build package

      mypkg-1.2_CFLAGS = -DPTYS_ARE_GETPT=1

   <pkg>_BUILDDIR - if the subdir to build in isn't <pkg> after extraction,
                    patches apply -p1 within this directory.

      mypkg-1.2_BUILDDIR = mypkg/src

   <pkg>_MAKEVARS - variables to force when making

      mypkg-1.2_MAKEVARS = LIBS=-lintl

   <pkg>_ROMFS - package specific romfs make target to be run after default
                 romfs target

   AUTOMAKE_ROMFS - override the main romfs target,  you have complete
                    control.

   Most of these can be used in the short version if you are only building 
   one package (ie., BUILDDIR, MAKEVARS).

   You can also add your own Kconfig file if you want fine grained config
   control.  If you do not provide a Kconfig a simple version will be
   created for you automatically at config time.  If you do add your own
   Kconfig file then you must include a top level config option to build
   your new directory, for example, a Kconfig for a packge with one extra
   option:

      config USER_MYPKG
      bool "mypkg"
      help
         This is mypkg

      config USER_MYPKG_OPTION
      bool "mypkg: simple option"
      depends on USER_MYPKG
      default n
      help
         Change the mypkg build in some useful way.

   If you add your library/application to the "lib" directory,  then change
   all occurances of of the text USER in the above example to LIB.
