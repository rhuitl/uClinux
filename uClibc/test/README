Following make targets are avaialable

make compile

This will compile and link the tests

make run

This will check for binaries if they are not there it
will call 'compile' target then it will execute all the
tests.

make check
make all

This will build and run tests.

The following make variables may help you in testing:
 - UCLIBC_ONLY  - only run tests against uClibc
 - GLIBC_ONLY   - only run tests against glibc
 - V / VERBOSE  - run tests with a lot of output
 - TEST_INSTALLED_UCLIBC - Test installed libraries 
                           under /lib and /usr/lib.
So, to just run the uClibc tests, try this:
make check UCLIBC_ONLY=1

 For: Developer

The structure of this test system is:
 test/                 toplevel dir containing common test code
 test/Rules.mak        Common build code
 test/Test.mak         Runtime test make code
 test/subdir/          code specific to a subsystem is stored in a subdir
 test/subdir/Makefile  describe the tests to run
 test/subdir/*.c       the tests

Each subdir Makefile must include the toplevel Test.mak file.  Before doing so,
you may define the TESTS and TESTS_DISABLED variables.  If you do not, TESTS
is built automatically based upon all the .c files in the subdir.
TESTS := foo
TESTS_DISABLED := bar
include ../Test.mak
Each test must use a similar .c name; so the "foo" test needs a "foo.c".

Additionally, the following options further control specific test behavior:
CFLAGS_foo    := extra cflags to use to compile test
DODIFF_foo    := compare the output of the glibc and uClibc tests (see below)
LDFLAGS_foo   := extra ldflags to use to link test
OPTS_foo      := extra options to pass to test
RET_foo       := expected exit code of test; default is 0
WRAPPER_foo   := execute stuff just before test

Or to control all tests in a subdir:
EXTRA_CLEAN   := extra files to remove in the clean target
EXTRA_CFLAGS  := -DFOO
EXTRA_LDFLAGS := -lpthread
OPTS          := 
WRAPPER       := 

If you want to compare the output of a test with known good output, then just
create a local file named "foo.out.good" and the output generated by the test
"foo" will be automatically stored in "foo.out" and compared to "foo.out.good".
