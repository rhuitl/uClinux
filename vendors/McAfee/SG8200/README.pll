SG8200 CAVIUM/OCTEON PLL PROGRAMMING
------------------------------------

The SG8200 hardware platform has a software controlled PLL that needs
its PROM programmed to output the correct clocks.

To do this we have come up with a modified SG560 that can drive the i2c
bus to the PROM on the SG8200 board. It has specially modified firmware
that can read and drive the i2c bus to the PLL on the SG8200.

This is what you need to do:

1.  Hook up SG560 PLL programming cable to CON16 on SG8200
2.  Put link on CON14 on SG8200
3.  Power up the SG560
4.  Power up the SG8200
5.  Check you can read the existing PLL PROM contents
    on the SG560 do "hd -b /dev/rtc"
6.  Program the PROM with SG8200_PLL.bin file
    on the SG560 do "cat SG8200_PLL.bin > /dev/rtc"

That should do it. You can check the contents of the PLL again using the
same "hd -b /dev/rtc". It should be identical to the contents of the
SG8200_PLL.bin file.

The SG8200_PLL.bin file is generated from the local SG8200_bin.hex file,
using:

    srec_cat -Output SG8200_PLL.bin -Binary SG8200_PLL.hex -Intel -ignore-checksums
