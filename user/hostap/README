Introduction
============

This is a Linux driver for wireless LAN cards based on Intersil's
Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. The driver supports a so called Host AP mode, i.e.,
it takes care of IEEE 802.11 management functions in the host computer
and acts as an access point. This does not require any special
firmware for the wireless LAN card. In addition to this, normal station
operations in BSS (infrastructure) and in IBSS (ad hoc). Current version
of the Host AP driver and tools supports WPA in AP (Authenticator) and
client (Supplicant) modes.

Intersil's station firmware for Prism2/2.5/3 chipset supports a so called
Host AP mode in which the firmware takes care of time critical tasks
like beacon sending and frame acknowledging, but leaves other
management tasks to host computer driver. This driver implements basic
functionality needed to initialize and configure Prism2/2.5/3-based cards,
to send and receive frames, and to gather statistics. In addition, it
includes an implementation of following IEEE 802.11 functions:
authentication (and deauthentication), association (reassociation, and
disassociation), data transmission between two wireless stations,
power saving (PS) mode signaling and frame buffering for PS
stations. The driver has also various features for development
debugging and for researching IEEE 802.11 environments like access to
hardware configuration records, I/O registers, and frames with 802.11
headers.


Distribution
============

Before version v0.1.0, Host AP driver used to be distributed as one
tarball. This has now been separated into four components:

hostap-driver:
	Linux driver for Intersil Prism2/2.5/3
	Host AP mode support, IEEE 802.11 management (AP)

hostapd:
	User space daemon for extended IEEE 802.11 management
	IEEE 802.1X Authenticator
	WPA/WPA2 Authenticator
	RADIUS Authentication client
	RADIUS Accounting client

hostap-utils:
	Utility programs for hostap-driver

wpa_supplicant:
	Additional program needed for WPA and WPA2 client operations. The
	Supplicant is used in WPA/WPA2 key handshakes to authenticate
	with the AP and to generate dynamic encryption keys (TKIP or
	CCMP).

See README files in each of these packages for information about the
different components of the full Host AP software package.


Feedback/Questions
==================

Any comments, reports on success/failure, ideas for further
improvement, feature requests, etc. are welcome at jkmaline@cc.hut.fi.
Please note, that I may not always have time for replying emails
quickly, but I'll try to go through my mail whenever time permits.
There is also a mailing list for Host AP related messages. Since this
list has a broader audience, you might even get an answer.. Anyway,
this list is recommended for general questions about Host AP driver
and its development. In addition, I will send release notes to it
whenever a new version is available.

The mailing list information and web archive is at
http://lists.shmoo.com/mailman/listinfo/hostap. Messages to
hostap@shmoo.com will be delivered to the subscribers. Please note, that
due to large number of spam and virus messages sent to the list address,
the list is configured to automatically accept messages only from
subscribed addresses.


Supported environment
=====================

Hardware
--------

The driver supports IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN PC Cards that are based
on Intersil's Prism2, 2.5, or 3 chipsets (especially, MAC processors
HFA3841 or HFA3842 for Prism2 and ISL3874 for Prism2.5). Native PCI
cards using Prism2.5/3 are also supported, but USB cards based on
Prism2.5/3 chipset are not supported in this version.

This version has been successfully tested with number of different
models, e.g., Compaq WL100 and WL200, D-Link DWL-650, and Linksys
WPC11, but there may still be issues with some models.

Some of the new Prism3-based cards use a smaller flash chip that does
not include full firmware for the card. For example, D-Link DWL-650
rev. P1 and D-Link DWL-520 rev. E1 are such cards. These cards require
that the firmware is downloaded to the card during initialization. See
utils/hostap_fw_load for example commands on doing this.

If you happen to have a wireless LAN card that is based on Prism2, but
does not seem to work with this driver, please let me know the model
and I can try to come up with a solution for any problems. This will
be easier if I have access to the non-functioning card model, but I
might also be able to solve some cases based on debug logs and other
easily collectible information.

In addition to Intersil's Prism2/2.5/3 chipsets, this driver may partly
support other chipsets. As far as I know, other chipsets do not have
Host AP mode, so this is not supported, but managed mode (i.e., being
a station in a BSS) seems to work with Prism1 (e.g., Intel, 3Com, and
Symbol cards) and Lucent WaveLAN. I would like to add support for AP
functionality also with these cards, but I'm not sure whether it can
be done without special firmware. Please let me know, if you have
further information about this.

The driver should be portable to different host CPUs. I have tested it
on ix86 and PowerPC platforms. In addition, I have received reports of
it working on Alpha and Arm.

Software
--------

This driver is developed in Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x environment and may
require the latest available kernel version. These are the only
"officially supported" versions in the development branch of the Host
AP driver. Older "stable branch" v0.1.x versions may be used with
Linux 2.2.x and older 2.4.x and 2.6.x versions.

PCI (hostap_pci.o) and PLX9052 (hostap_plx.o) versions require at
least Linux kernel version 2.4.x for their PCI initialization
routines.


Driver installation
===================

PC Cards (not in PLX9052 adapter)	hostap_cs.o
---------------------------------

Systems using kernel tree PCMCIA modules:

'Makefile' includes commands for compiling and installing Host AP
driver for systems using kernel tree PCMCIA support (i.e., kernel
modules are not compiled with external pcmcia-cs package). Edit
KERNEL_PATH in Makefile to match your system. Run 'make' (this
compiles the sources; this step can be run as non-root user). After
the compilation has finished, you can install hostap_cs.o by running
'make install' (as root). You will then need to restart cardmgr
to load new configuration from /etc/pcmcia/hostap_cs.conf.


Systems using external pcmcia-cs modules:

There are two options for building and installing:

1) just like the steps for kernel tree, but also configure PCMCIA_PATH in
   Makefile (i.e., compile and install pcmcia-cs separately)

2)
Copy everything except driver/modules/Makefile from 'driver' subdirectory on
top of root pcmcia-cs directory, i.e., so that driver/modules/hostap.c ends up
in pcmcia-cs's 'modules' directory, like so:

	# make sure that Makefile does not overwrite old Makefile in pcmcia-cs
	mv driver/modules/Makefile driver/modules/Makefile-not-used
	cp -a driver/* /usr/src/pcmcia-cs-3.1.31

After this you should be able to build and install pcmcia-cs with this
driver (hostap_cs.o) using normal commands ('make config', 'make all',
and 'make install').

PC Cards in PLX9052 adapter	hostap_plx.o
---------------------------

'Makefile' includes commands for compiling and installing Host AP
driver for systems using PLX9052-based PCI adapters for PC Cards.
These cards do not use pcmcia-cs package and hostap_plx.o is used to
also initialize the PCI parts of such setup. Edit KERNEL_PATH in
Makefile to match your system. Run 'make' (this compiles the
sources; this step can be run as non-root user). After the compilation
has finished, you can install hostap_plx.o by running 'make
install' (as root). You can probe PCI bus for PLX9052 adapters and
initialize the devices by loading the module ('modprobe hostap_plx').

PCI cards based on Prism2.5/3	hostap_pci.o
-----------------------------

'Makefile' includes commands for compiling and installing Host AP
driver for systems using Prism2.5/3-based PCI cards. These cards do not
use pcmcia-cs package. Edit KERNEL_PATH in Makefile to match your
system. Run 'make' (this compiles the sources; this step can be
run as non-root user). After the compilation has finished, you can
install hostap_pci.o by running 'make install' (as root). You can
probe PCI bus for Prism2.5/3 PCI cards and initialize the devices by loading
the module ('modprobe hostap_pci').

Note!
If you have a PC Card adapter in your PCI card, this card does _not_
use hostap_pci.o module, but hostap_plx.o or hostap_cs.o (with
pcmcia-cs).


Installation and configuration
==============================

See README file for driver compilation and installation instructions
(PC Card systems using kernel tree PCMCIA modules or external pcmcia-cs
package, PC Cards in PLX9052-based adapters, and Prism2.5/3 PCI cards).

If you are using hostap_cs.o version, pcmcia-cs needs to know which
driver to use for each PC Card. This driver has its own file
(/etc/pcmcia/hostap_cs.conf) that lists few PC Cards that are
supported. It does not include every Prism2/2.5/3-based card, so you may
need to add your model to hostap_cs.conf in order to get the driver
started. If you add new model information to the configuration file
and the card works with this driver, please send me the output of
'cardctl ident' and the lines you added so that I can include them
in the next release.

If you are using hostap_plx.o version, prism2_plx_known_manfids table
in driver/modules/hostap_plx.c needs to have an entry for the PC Card
you are using. Module parametered 'ignore_cis' can used to skip manfid
verifications for testing any card (please note, that this will try to
initialize any PC Card in PLX adapter as Prism2). If you have a card
that works with the driver after adding its manfid to the table,
please let me know the card manufacturer, model, and the manfid
numbers so that I can include them in the next release of the driver.

Unlike most Linux network drivers, Host AP driver creates multiple
network devices. wifi0 (or wifi# if you have multiple cards) is the
"master interface" for the radio device. It uses IEEE 802.11 headers
and is used internally by the driver to process frames to and from
other interfaces. wlan0 is the default data interface. It is the
interface that is used in most configurations, e.g., it is configured
with an IP address and iwconfig commands can be used with it. When
using WDS, each link will create a new virtual device (wlan0wds0).

Please note that the current driver version enables the Prism2/2.5/3
card only when at least one of the interfaces is set up (e.g., with
'ifconfig wlan0 up'). The device is disabled when all interfaces are
set down. This means that the card will not associate (in client mode)
with an AP before at least one of the interfaces is set up.

The driver supports Linux Wireless Extensions and certain configuration
items can be viewed and changed with iwconfig(8) and iwpriv(8) from
wireless utilities, e.g., mode (AP/station; iwconfig's 'mode'),
channel (iwconfig's 'freq' or 'channel'), WEP (encryption; iwconfig's
'key').

TODO: list example iwconfig commands and explain what they do

Current driver supports following iwpriv commands:

iwpriv wlan0 monitor <val>		[DEPRECATED]

	testing commands that allow low-level access to baseband processor
	configuration registers; do *NOT* use these, unless you are sure what
	you are doing; these do not have error checking and it may be
	possible to cause physical damage to your equipment by setting invalid
	values

prism2_param
------------

prism2_param is an extentsion to private ioctls; it uses ioctl
sub-type to provide number of configuration items for the
driver. iwpriv from the latest version of Linux wireless tools and
receive Linux wireless extensions support these sub-ioctls
directly. Older versions can use prism2_param wrapper from the
hostap-utils package for setting these parameters.

'iwpriv wlan# <param_name> <value>' or 'prism2_param wlan#
<param_name> <value>'. Most values can be read with 'iwpriv wlan#

Bridging between wireless and wired networks
============================================

Prism2/2.5/3 AP driver controls a wireless device (wlan#), but does not
take care of bridging between wireless and wired networks. If this AP
feature is required, it has to be implemented using an external
software.

Linux kernels support Ethernet bridging (code already present in 2.4.x
kernels and also as a separate patch for 2.2.x kernels). This can be
used to easily build an AP between the wired and wireless
networks. Below is an example of a simple setup in which the AP has
one Ethernet interface and one wireless interface. If needed, see
http://bridge.sourceforge.net/ for more information on Linux kernel's
Ethernet bridging.

Example:

(after loading Prism2/2.5/3 AP driver)

brctl addbr br0
brctl addif br0 eth0
brctl addif br0 wlan0
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig wlan0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig br0 192.168.100.200 up

(the AP bridges packets between Ethernet and wireless LAN and can be
reached with IP address 192.168.100.200 from either network; stations
associated to this AP can then communicate with other wireless LAN
stations and with the hosts in the wired network)


Wireless distribution system (WDS)
==================================

IEEE 802.11 specifies a method for using wireless connection as a
distribution system. A special data frame with four addresses is
defined for this. This allows layer 2 bridging of packets (two
addresses, the immediate sender and receiver, are required for 802.11
frame acknowledgement; the other two addresses are the original
sending and receiver of the frame).

There is a bug in station firmware code used in Prism2/2.5/3 cards that
prevents standard-compliant 4-address frames being sent in Host AP
mode. To overcome this problem, the current version of the driver uses
a non-standard frame format, in which the 802.11 header has first
three addresses and the fourth address (which is usually also in the
header) is sent after the frame payload.

Due to this non-standard frame format, the driver with a card using
station firmware older than v1.5.0 does not interoperate with
standard-compliant AP devices as far as WDS connections are concerned.
The non-standard frame format should be identical to the one used in
OpenAP project (http://opensource.instant802.com/), so APs using their
code should interoperate.

Note!
-----

The latest firmware versions (STA firmware version 1.5.0 or newer)
have fixed this bug. The driver can use standard-compliant 4-address
frames with these firmware versions. Please upgrade your card firmware
if you want to use IEEE 802.11 compliant WDS frames with the
driver. Current driver code selects automatically which format to use
based on the firmware version on the card.


Example WDS configuration:

- bridging between two wired network using a wireless link
- additional wireless net included in the bridge setup

Note! It should be needless to say, but this kind of bridging of wired
networks introduces serious security problems due to open nature of
the wireless network. This is just a simple example of what could be
done with bridging code and WDS links. Connections should be encrypted
in real networks, e.g., with IPSec, to prevent packets from being
captured of injected into the network.


Network 192.168.1.0/24  (same address space in each network)

<wired net A>--eth0 : AP-A : wlan0 -- <wireless net A>
                               |
                              WDS
                               |
                             wlan0 : AP-B : eth0--<wired net B>

Each AP has eth0 as the wired network device and Host AP driver loaded
and wlan0 as the wireless device.

AP-A: wireless LAN card with hwaddr 00:11:11:11:11:11, IP addr 192.168.1.1
AP-B: wireless LAN card with hwaddr 00:22:22:22:22:22, IP addr 192.168.1.2


AP-A configuration:

iwpriv wlan0 wds_add 00:22:22:22:22:22
brctl addbr br0
brctl addif br0 eth0
brctl addif br0 wlan0
brctl addif br0 wlan0wds0
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig wlan0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig wlan0wds0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig br0 192.168.1.1 up

AP-B configuration:

iwpriv wlan0 wds_add 00:11:11:11:11:11
brctl addbr br0
brctl addif br0 eth0
brctl addif br0 wlan0wds0
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig wlan0wds0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig br0 192.168.1.2 up

(AP-B's wlan0 interface is not used in this example; all wireless
traffic goes through WDS link to AP-A using wlan0wds0)


'brctl show' should show br0 bridge with the added interfaces and STP
enabled.

'brctl showstp br0' should show more statistics about each bridge
port. 'state' should first be few seconds 'learning' and then change
to 'forwarding'.

'brctl showmacs br0' can be used to check behind which bridge port
each known mac addr is currently.

With this example configuration, the users of the network can be in
any of the three listed network. They can even move their computer to
another network and the bridging code will eventually (it seemed to
take about 30 seconds in my test; this can probably be adjusted with
bridge parameters) learn about the move. The bridging is performed on
layer 2, so other hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network look like they
were in the same physical network, no matter in which part of the
bridged network (wired net A, wired net B, wireless net A) they are.


Monitoring other APs
====================

Host AP driver can be instructed to monitor beacon frames from other
APs (other_ap_policy parameter). In addition, WDS code can be setup to
automatically add new WDS links to all detected APs to ease bridge
setup with STP.

prism2_param wlan0 autom_ap_wds 1
prism2_param wlan0 other_ap_policy 1

WDS connections can be added with 'iwpriv wlan# wds_add <other end
hwaddr>' and removed with similar wds_del command. hwaddr
00:00:00:00:00:00 can be used as a special address to pre-allocate
netdevices. These entries are used when adding the real WDS link,
e.g., when a new AP is detected. Pre-allocated devices can be included
in a bridging configuration and set into UP state before knowing the
real AP address.

In other words, you would need to run 'iwpriv wlan0 wds_add
00:00:00:00:00:00' N times after loading the driver and then add
interfaces wlan0wds0 to wlan0wds<N-1> into bridge configuration. When
new APs are detected after this, they will be assigned a pre-allocated
interface that is already part of the bridge setup.

Another option would be to make an external program for monitoring new
WDS links (e.g., from /proc/net/hostap/wlan#/wds) and automatically
add them to the bridge setup with brctl.

======================

Prism2/2.5/3 cards have a test mode that can be used for monitoring wireless
networks. In this mode the driver receives all raw IEEE 802.11 frames
(including management frames).

Monitor mode is enabled with 'iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor'. Monitor
mode was added to wireless tools version 25. With later versions, you
cannot use iwconfig, so please either upgrade wireless tools or use
old iwpriv monitor method described below.

'prism2_param wlan0 monitor_type <val>' can be used to select which
headers are included in the monitored frames (0: IEEE 802.11,
1: Prism2 + IEEE 802.11).

Previously, monitoring mode was started using iwpriv(8). This is now
deprecated and it is currently implemented as a backward compatibility
wrapper for iwconfig mode command. It may be removed in the future
versions of the driver.

iwpriv wlan0 monitor 2
	start monitor mode and send received frames (including 802.11 header)
	to user space using normal netdevice. This changes the device type
	to ARPHRD_IEEE80211 so that user space programs know how to handle
	different header type.
iwpriv wlan0 monitor 3
	start monitor mode and send received frames (including Prism2 RX data
	and 802.11 header) to user space using normal netdevice. This changes
	the device type to ARPHRD_IEEE80211_PRISM so that user space programs
	know how to handle different header type.

iwpriv wlan0 monitor 0
	disable monitor mode and return to Host AP mode


Example program in 'sniff', wlansniff.c, is a simple 802.11 frame
parser that shows both the Prism2/2.5/3-specific data from the RX frame
and parsed contents of the 802.11 frame.

Latest versions of libpcap and Ethereal support ARPHRD_IEEE80211 and
ARPHRD_IEEE80211_PRISM, so monitor modes 2 and 3 can be used with them
for real time IEEE 802.11 network monitoring.


Access control list (ACL) for stations
======================================

Default configuration of the AP allows any station to authenticate and
associate (open policy). This behavior can be changed with ACL
configuration.

ACL is based on MAC address of the station. New addresses can be added with
'addmac' command (iwpriv) and policy can be changed with 'maccmd'.

Examples:

# allow policy
iwpriv wlan0 maccmd 1
iwpriv wlan0 addmac 00:11:22:33:44:55
iwpriv wlan0 addmac 00:12:34:56:78:9a

Allow only stations 00:11:22:33:44:55 and 00:12:34:56:78:9a to
authenticate with the AP.


# deny policy
iwpriv wlan0 maccmd 2
iwpriv wlan0 addmac 00:11:22:33:44:55
iwpriv wlan0 addmac 00:12:34:56:78:9a

Deny authentication from stations 00:11:22:33:44:55 and
00:12:34:56:78:9a, but allow every other station to authenticate.


# open policy
iwpriv wlan0 maccmd 0

Allow any station to authenticate (regardless of ACL contents).


Encryption
==========

Host AP driver supports both firmware and host driver based
encryption. Firmware based encryption has some limitations--STA
firmware versions before 1.4.x have a bug in Host AP mode that breaks
TX frames when using WEP, it does not support other encryption
algorithms than WEP, most versions do not support WEP key mappings
with individual keys for different stations. These limitations can be
overcome by using host based encryption.

Host AP driver uses modularized encryption implementation that allows
the encryption code be shared by different hardware versions of the
driver (hostap_{cs,plx,pci}.o). In addition, this design allows one to
load new algorithms dynamically if needed. WEP implementation
(driver/modules/hostap_crypt_wep.c) can be used as an example
implementation when adding support for other algorithms.

WEP implementation, hostap_crypt_wep.o, is not loaded
automatically during initialization, but driver tries to load it with
kmod when WEP is configured. If this does not work, the module needs
to be loaded either with modprobe/insmod after having loaded driver
module or by configuring /etc/modules.conf or pcmcia-cs configuration
to load it when using Host AP driver.

When using WEP, default encryption keys can be set using 'key' command
of iwconfig(8) from Wireless Tools. All other setups (key mapping with
individual keys or other algorithms) must use separate tool,
utils/hostap_crypt_conf. See hostap-utils package for more instructions
on how to use that tool.

TKIP (WEP with per packet keys and Michael MIC, hostap_crypt_tkip.o)
and CCMP (AES-CCM, hostap_crypt_ccmp.o) are used with WPA. These
algorithms require host-based encryption and decryption because the
Prism2/2.5/3 firmware does not support them. hostapd and wpa_supplicant
can be used to negotiate encryption keys for TKIP/CCMP when operating in
station mode. In addition, these algorithms can be used on WDS
links. Static TKIP/CCMP keys can be set with hostap_crypt_conf.


IEEE 802.1X
===========

See separate hostapd package for IEEE 802.1X and WPA/WPA2
support. hostapd can be used with Host AP driver to implement IEEE
802.1X Authenticator with support for dynamic WEP keying and IEEE
802.11i (WPA/WPA2) with TKIP/CCMP encryption.


Roaming in station mode
=======================

Host AP driver supports three different modes for roaming in station
modes (Managed/Ad-hoc). These are configured with prism2_param
host_roaming.

Firmware-based roaming (mode 0; default)
----------------------

Station firmware decides when to scan channels for APs and which AP to
use. Host AP driver only configured SSID and possible WEP keys, but
does not control AP selection in any other ways.

Host-based roaming (mode 1)
------------------

Station firmware decides when to scan channels for APs and informs
Host AP driver about scan results. Host AP driver will then select
which AP to use. Current version of the selection code is quite
simple, the driver just selects the first entry in the list of APs
(which should be sorted by signal quality). In addition, this mode
allows user to specify preferred AP with 'iwconfig wlan0 ap
<bssid>'. This preferred AP will be used if it is in the list of scan
results. User will also need to set SSID.

Manual scan and roaming (mode 2)
-----------------------

Both scanning and AP selection are left to user; neither firmware nor
Host AP driver initialize scanning automatically. User space programs
can use Linux wireless extensions to initialize scanning and joining
an AP. Active IEEE 802.11 scanning is not required; any other external
mean can be used to get knowledge about the AP configuration.

Example commands:

# enable manual scan and roaming in managed (infra/BSS) mode
iwpriv wlan0 host_roaming 2
iwconfig wlan0 mode managed

# scan channels; set broadcast SSID ('Any') to accept all SSIDs in scan
# results. Optionally, could also set WEP keys, if needed.
iwconfig wlan0 essid any
iwlist wlan0 scan

# Select AP with SSID foobar and BSSID 00:11:22:33:44:55
iwconfig wlan0 essid foobar
iwconfig wlan0 ap 00:11:22:33:44:55

Note: both SSID and BSSID must be set in order to make association
work. Setting BSSID with 'ap' command must be done after SSID is set
since this commands triggers join request for Prism2 firmware.

Note: scanning is limited to current SSID. If information about other
APs is required, SSID must be set to 'Any'. However, this will remove
current association. Alternatively, host scan command, 'iwpriv wlan0
hostscan 1', can be used without breaking the connection. This command
requires STA f/w version 1.3.1 or newer. In addition, current version
of the driver shows hostscan results only in the kernel log ('dmesg').
