Changes from Version 2.2 to 2.3:

- Fixed the init script to create/remove /var/lock/subsys/adsl (patch
  courtesy of Charley Carter.)

- Added support (under Linux) for N_HDLC line discipline which should
  greatly reduce CPU usage.  My tests show it cuts CPU usage in half.
  My 486 DX2/66 gets 800 kb/s at 22% CPU usage.

- adsl-connect uses "setsid" (if available) so that adsl-stop doesn't kill
  its caller.  There is (IMO) a bug in pppd which kills all processes in
  its process group if the "pty" option is used.  The setsid program gets
  around this bug, on Linux at least.

- Port to Solaris, courtesy of David Holland.

- Renamed spec file from "spec" to "rp-pppoe.spec" and made some cleanups.
  NOTE: Red Hat, in their infinite wisdom, decided to make the new RPM
  compress man pages automatically.  You may have problems building RPM's
  from source unless you get the latest rpm package and make sure it
  compresses man pages.

Changes from Version 2.1 to 2.2:

- Added "-f" option to pppoe to allow use of any Ethernet frame type
  for PPPoE.  USE WITH CAUTION -- this is a workaround for broken DSL
  providers, not something you should monkey with freely!

- Added pppoe-sniff program to help expose non-standard PPPoE implementations.

Changes from Version 2.0 to 2.1:

- Fixed minor bugs in bounds-checking

- Modified adsl-status to use output of "netstat -r -n" to determine whether
  or not link is up.  This should make it independent of locale, I hope!

- Added "-k" and "-d" options to pppoe.

Changes from Version 1.9 to 2.0:

- Addition of pppoe-server

- Massive internal code restructuring

- Zealous bounds-checking everywhere.

- adsl-setup now quotes user name and password in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets.

- Ported to OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD, courtesy of Geoff Mottram
  and Yannis Sismanis.

- Rearranged adsl-* shell scripts, courtesy of Heiko Schlittermann.

- Fixed bug in which Host-Uniq did not work if access concentrator sent
  a cookie.

- Addition of SuSE-specific "init" script, courtesy of Gary Cameron.

Changes from Version 1.8 to 1.9:

- Added some more documentation to HOW-TO-CONNECT

- Demand-dialling option now works correctly

- SIGHUP terminates pppoe after sending a PADT to the access concentrator

- Minor cleanups to connection shell scripts

Changes from Version 1.7 to 1.8:

- Added demand-dialling option

- Clarified HOW-TO-CONNECT

- Added adsl-status script

- Added "restart" and "status" options to Red Hat /etc/rc.d/init.d/adsl script

- Made adsl-setup check for existence of pppd

- Wildcarded external interface in firewall rules

- Made pppoe send a PADT frame if connection is terminated
