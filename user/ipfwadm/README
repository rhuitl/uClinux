IPFWADM - Version 2.3.0 - July 30, 1996

Copyright (c) 1995,1996 by X/OS Experts in Open Systems BV.
This is free software.  See below for details.

Ipfwadm is a utility to administer the IP accounting and IP firewall
services offered by the Linux kernel.

This version (2.3.0) of ipfwadm requires Linux kernel version 1.3.66 or
later.  To use some of the new features (transparent proxying and
input-only/output-only accounting rules) you need kernel 2.0.0 or later.
Check out ipfwadm's home page on the World Wide Web
	http://www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm/
for the most recent information about ipfwadm and recent kernel
(in)compatibilities (if any).

Look at the accompanying manual page, ipfwadm(8), for a description
of how to use this program.  The ipfw(4) manual page describes the
kernel level interface of the IP accounting/firewall services.
Look at the above mentioned WWW-page for more information (whenever
available).

This utility is meant to be a replacement for the existing ipfw(8)
utility, as found in the net-tools package.  Ipfwadm was made to be
more complete and easier to use than ipfw.

Among the features offered by ipfwadm are:

-  Changing default policies for all firewall categories.
-  Automatically adding the necessary extra rules when the named
   hosts have more than one IP address.
-  Support for specifying the interface address and/or name.
-  Listing and resetting packet/byte counters "atomically" for
   setting up a reliable accounting scheme.
-  Listing the existing rules in a number of formats.
-  Support for optional functions (bidirectional rules, TCP ACK
   and SYN flag matching, changing the IP TOS-field).
-  Specifying input-only or output-only accounting rules.
-  Redirection support (used for tranparent proxying).
-  Masquerading support, including listing active sessions
   and specifying timeout values.
-  A complete manual page.
