config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	bool "Support for shadow passwords"
	default n
	help
	  Build support for shadow password in /etc/shadow.  This file is only
	  readable by root and thus the encrypted passwords are no longer
	  publicly readable.

config USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_SHADOW
	bool "Use busybox shadow password functions"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_PWD_GRP && USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	help
	    If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's shadow
	    password handling functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
	    (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	    configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	    order for the shadow password functions to work.  This generally
	    makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	    Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	    system's /etc/shadow file when handling shadow passwords.  This
	    makes your system smaller and I will get fewer emails asking about
	    how glibc NSS works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be
	    able to use PAM to access shadow passwords from remote LDAP
	    password servers and whatnot.

config USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
	bool "Use internal password and group functions rather than system functions"
	default n
	help
	    If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password
	    and group functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
	    (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	    configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	    order for the password and group functions to work.  This generally
	    makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	    Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	    system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
	    smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
	    works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
	    PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot.  And if you
	    want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
	    /lib/libnss_* libraries.

	    If you enable this option, it will add about 1.5k to busybox.

config USER_BUSYBOX_ADDGROUP
	bool "addgroup"
	default n

	help
	  If called with two non-option arguments, deluser
	  or delgroup will remove an user from a specified group.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHECK_NAMES
	bool "Enable sanity check on user/group names in adduser and addgroup"
	default n
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_ADDUSER || USER_BUSYBOX_ADDGROUP
	help
	  Enable sanity check on user and group names in adduser and addgroup.
	  To avoid problems, the user or group name should consist only of
	  letters, digits, underscores, periods, at signs and dashes,
	  and not start with a dash (as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).
	  For compatibility with Samba machine accounts "$" is also supported
