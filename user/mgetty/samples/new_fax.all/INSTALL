Step 5: Edit the faxlist file
Step 6: Test it!

To find where mgetty expects new_fax, enter

	strings /usr/sbin/mgetty | grep new_fax

To test new_fax enter a command like

	/usr/local/sbin/new_fax 0 12345 1 /var/spool/fax/incoming/fnXXX.01

This would simulate a sucessfull fax from 12345. You should take an existing
file inside /var/spool/fax/incoming.
