@chapter Introduction

@code{mgetty} allows you to make optimum use of your modem or fax modem in
a unix environment. @code{mgetty} handles incoming calls without
interfering with outgoing calls. If the modem can do fax class 2 or 2.0,
@code{mgetty} can also receive faxes.

@code{sendfax} is a standalone backend program to send fax files.  

This manual explains how to configure and install the package on various
operating systems and modems, and how to use those programs.

@node Overview, Supported, Copying, Intro
@section Features of @code{mgetty} and @code{sendfax}

This package contains two major programs, @code{mgetty} and
@code{sendfax}.

This is what you can do with @code{sendfax} if you have a standard
class 2 fax modem:

@itemize @bullet
@item
send faxes directly or using shell scripts

@item
do ``fax polling'', this means you can call the weather station and
get them to send you a fax containing the current weather map. (Not all
modem manufacturers implement this feature in their modems!)

@item
create a ``fax queue'', outgoing faxes get sent automatically, the
user is informed by mail about the result.
@end itemize

@code{mgetty} allows you to use your modem line for receiving fax and
data calls, without hindering dial-out on the same line.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{mgetty} knows about ``smart'' modems, and will make sure that the
modem is always in a defined state (specific modem initialization possible)

@item
Incoming calls are answered manually (@code{RING}
-> @code{ATA} -> @code{CONNECT}) instead of using auto-answer
(@samp{ATS0=1}), this way the modem won't pick up the phone when the
machine is down or logins are not allowed. 

@item
@code{mgetty} incorporates all features of uugetty: it honours @file{LCK.*}
files created by @code{uucico} and other comm programs, this way it will
prevent dial-outs while a caller is online and it won't be confused if
other programs use the modem.

@item
@code{mgetty} can receive faxes (if your modem supports fax class 2 or 2.0).

@item
@code{mgetty} knows about incoming FidoNet calls.

@item
@code{mgetty} has extensive logging / debugging features

@item
do ``fax poll sending'', that is, you can setup your machine as fax poll
server, to send some fax pages to ``fax poll'' callers. (Send informations
about your system, the current wheather map, ...). Be warned, even less
modems support this feature.

@item
@code{mgetty} can selectively refuse calls based upon CallerID, if your
local Telco supports it and your modem knows how to decode and report
it.  CallerID is also logged.

@item
@code{mgetty} has facilities to allow you to refuse incoming FAXes when
available disk space is low.

@end itemize

If you have any bug reports, suggestions, please report them to
gert@@greenie.muc.de (or, if [and only if!] that doesn't work, to
gert@@space.net).

Also, I have created a mgetty mailing list, for discussion of problems
and suggestions. You can subscribe by sending a request to
mgetty-request@@muc.de (forwarded to Crynwr.com for precessing)
and you can send articles to the list by sending them to mgetty@@muc.de.
The list manager will write you back for verification of your address,
so make sure it is correct.

The mailing list is currently gated bidirectionally into the newsgroup
de.alt.comm.mgetty. In spite of being in the German language hierarchy,
the language in the group is English. Posts in German should be ignored.

The mailing list is archived on a WWW site, look at
@file{http://www.elilabs.com/mgarc/index.html} (many thanks to
Robert J. Brown, rj@@eli.elilabs.com).  It's also archived by Marc
Schaefer, on @file{http://search.alphanet.ch/} @strong{(NEW!)}.
The latter search engine indexes somewhat more than only the mgetty list,
so you might want to add 'mgetty' to your query to restrict it.

@node Supported, Install, Overview, Intro
@section Supported systems and modems

Mgetty has been successfully installed and run on the following
systems (though older systems might need work to get current mgetty
versions to compile):

@display
    SCO Unix 3.2.1 (ODT 1.0)                   (well tested)
    SCO Unix 3.2.4 (ODT 2.0 + 3.0)             (very well tested)
    SCO Open Server 5.0                        (well tested)
    Linux (everything from 0.99pl1 up)         (very well tested)
    ISC Unix 3.0                                (tested)
    SVR4 Unix                                   (well tested)
    SVR4.2 Unix                                 (needs more testing)
    AT&T 3B1 3.51m                              (tested)
    HP-UX 8.x and 9.x                           (well tested)

    Solaris 2.x                                 (well tested)  
    NetBSD / FreeBSD (all versions)            (very well tested)
    Apple Darwin (Kernel 5.1)                  (tested)
@end display

It should be possible to run mgetty on any other Unix with @file{termio.h}
or @file{termios.h}. For best results, use of the library functions
@code{select(S)} or @code{poll(S)} is recommended, but there's a workaround
if your system hasn't either. (Warning: for Unix SVR3.1 or earlier,
@emph{do not use poll()}, it will not
work on tty devices.)


Up to now, it has been successfully used with the following modems (no
exhaustive list) in fax mode:

@display
    ZyXEL U1496 (various ROM releases)
        (very well tested, a couple of problems remain, depending on the
         ROM release)

    ZyXEL 2864/2864I (various ROM releases)
        (very well tested, some firmware versions have problems)

    USR Courier/Sportster series
        (well tested, Couriers work great, Sportsters are ok for data)

    MultiTech (various models)
        (tested, works very well, very good fax implementation)

    SupraFAX v32bis
        (tested, works well, no fax polling available)

    GVC FM144/+
        (tested, works well, no fax polling available)

    TKR DM-24VF+ (Deltafax)
        (tested, works quite well)

    Zoom V.FAST 24K/28K
        (tested, works, some problems with fax/data distinction)

    ELSA MicroLink (various)
    	(tested, usually works well, some firmware versions have issues)
@end display

It @emph{should} work with all class 2 faxmodems. Maybe the DC2
character sent at the beginning of a page by @file{faxrec.c} must be
changed to XON, for very old class 2 modems (implementing very old drafts of
the standard). @xref{Modems}. 

In Data mode, it will work with every Hayes-compatible modem.


@node Install, intro-runtime, Supported, Intro
@section Configuration and installation

Compiling of the package should be quite straightforward. You have to
copy @file{policy.h-dist} to @file{policy.h} and edit it to set some
local policy options, see the comments in that file.  (Most default
values should be fine, though).

Then, edit the @file{Makefile}, to specify installation paths, some
system defines and some system dependent libraries (explained there).

After that, a @samp{make} should build the programs and the documentation.

Before you can run @samp{make install} to setup and install everything,
make sure that the user that you specified for @samp{FAX_OUT_USER} in
@file{Makefile} exists in your system.  This user will be needed to
run @code{faxrunq} or @code{faxrunqd}, and owns all the outgoing fax queue
(this has been changed for 1.1.29 - earlier versions had the fax queue
world writeable, which was a security problem).
  
If your compiler complains about the @code{#ident} lines I use for
@file{RCS}, please run @code{make noident}, that will take care of those
lines (this is only needed if the compiler refuses to go on - some
compilers complain, but go on anyways).

If you get an error message about ``unresolved symbols'' when linking, you
may have to tell the package whether you have the select(S) or poll(S)
system calls, by defining @code{-DUSE_SELECT} or @code{-DUSE_POLL} flags in
the @file{Makefile} (If you don't know it, try both, until the error goes
away). If it's not related to @code{select} or @code{poll}, please check
the systems man pages which libraries to link, and add appropriate
@code{-l<library>} statements to @code{LIBS}.

If your system has neither the select(S) call nor the poll(S) call,
mgetty is not fully operational---these functions are the only way to
prevent mgetty from eating up characters when some other process is
trying to dial out.

You can use mgetty anyway, by specifying @code{-DUSE_READ} in the
Makefile, but beware: with this, mgetty will eat up at least one
character of the modem response when another program is dialing out.
That may lead to disastrous results if e.g. the @samp{CONNECT} string
is thus corrupted, but most of the time, the character that @file{mgetty}
eats away will be an @code{cr} or @code{nl} or part of the command
that the modem echoes back.

If you have any problems compiling mgetty and sendfax (on a Unix-like
system---I do not support MS-DOS or Windows!), please contact me.
@emph{But make sure that you have read the documentation!}

Later on in this document you can find some more detailed instructions
about specific operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, and so on).

@node intro-runtime,  , Install, Intro
@section Runtime configuration: Overview

If @code{mgetty} or @code{sendfax} are run "as is", they will use their
compiled-in defaults from @file{policy.h}.

If the configuration files @file{mgetty.config} (@pxref{runtime-mgetty})
and @file{sendfax.config} (@pxref{runtime-sendfax}) exist (and are
readable), both programs will get their run-time configuration from there.
Items not specified there will still be taken from the compiled-in
defaults. Command line switches will always override those settings. The
configuration files are usually located in @file{@CONFDIR@/}.

If you specify command line arguments (see the mgetty(1) and sendfax(8) man
pages for details), this will override both compiled-in and config file
defaults.

You can't simply call @code{mgetty} from a shell script (like @file{/etc/rc})

@node How, Inittab, mgetty, mgetty
@section How @code{mgetty} works

To help you understand how mgetty works, here is an example of what
happens in various circumstances when you use it to control a modem
connected to a serial line, e.g. @file{/dev/tty2a}.

When the computer is booted, the operating system starts the @code{init}
process, which is responsible for making sure that gettys are running on
the appropiate i/o devices, e.g. virtual terminals, serial lines and
modems.  @code{init} reads its configuration file, @file{/etc/inittab} (on
System V), which tells it that the line @file{/dev/tty2a} should be
controlled by mgetty. It then creates an entry in @file{/etc/utmp}
(@code{login} needs this, that's why you can't log in if you try to start
mgetty by hand), and forks a new @code{mgetty} process, using the command
line specified.

When mgetty is started, it first checks if a valid lock file held by
another process exists. If it does, this means that the port is in
use, and mgetty will wait until the lock file goes away. Invalid lock
files, e.g. for nonexistent processes (``stale'' locks), are ignored.

Once the port is free, mgetty creates its own lockfile, initializes the
modem and removes its lock file again. Then it waits for something to
happen on the port. Note that it does not @emph{read} any characters, it
just checks if there are any available for reading by using @code{poll()}
or @code{select()}.

There are two possibilities once characters arrive, either a different
program (e.g.  @code{uucico}) has started dialing out or a @samp{RING} was
sent by the modem.  In the first case, mgetty should leave the port
alone. This is easy @emph{if} the program dialing out has created a valid
lock file: mgetty will find it, wait for it to go away and then exit (which
will cause @code{init} to start a fresh @code{mgetty} process, which will
then wait for the next call).

In the second case, when there is no lock file, mgetty assumes that
the phone is ringing, creates a lock file and reads the characters
available. If it finds a @samp{RING}, it picks up the phone by sending
@samp{ATA} and waits for the @samp{CONNECT} message. If the caller is
a fax machine, it saves the fax in the directory @file{FAX_SPOOL_IN}
(usually @file{@FAX_SPOOL_IN@}) and exits. If it is a modem,
it prints @file{/etc/issue} and displays a login prompt. Once it has
received a login string, it calls @code{@LOGIN@} and lets it handle
things from here. @code{login} will read the password and will then
start the user's login shell, @code{uucico}, a dialup SLIP link or
whatever, but mgetty doesn't care about that. The lock file remains so
that no other programs will try to use the modem while somebody is logged in.

(If the @file{login.config} configuration file is used, mgetty can also call
other login programs than @code{@LOGIN@}. See below for more details)

Once mgetty has terminated for whatever reason, @code{init} might
reinitialize the port (this is why mgetty waits for lock files to go
away instead of quitting immediately) and will then start a new
@code{mgetty} process, which will remove lock files left over from the
last login.

The lock file handling is tricky, but very important. It is essential
that @emph{all} programs that use the modem agree on one locking
protocol, otherwise one program might not know that the modem is in
use and will try to dial out anyway. A typical lock file is a file
called @file{@LOCK@}, containing the process ID (PID) of
the process currently using the modem. Other processes can read it and
tell if the lock file belongs to an existing process or if it is
``stale'' and can be removed. This will obviously not work if the
processes look for lock files in different places, or if one of them
writes its PID in ASCII and another one tries to read it as a binary
number (while mgetty and sendfax do not care whether foreign lock files
are written in binary or ascii format, other programs do! mgetty can
sometimes detect this problem, and will then log a warning).

@node Inittab, Devices, How, mgetty
@section The @file{/etc/inittab} entry
An typical @file{inittab} entry for @code{mgetty} looks like this (on
SystemV-style OSes):

@example
<tt>:rlevel:<respawn|off>:@SBINDIR@/mgetty [options] <device>
@end example

where @samp{tt} is a short form of the @samp{device} name, used by
@code{init} and @code{who} for internal purposes. Usually this is
something like @samp{S0} or @samp{2A} or so.

@samp{rlevel} specifies the runlevel that the command in the fourth field
is run at, this may be @samp{23} or @samp{56} or so, look at @code{man
init} and the existing @file{/etc/inittab} on your system.

The next field tells @code{init} whether that entry is active
(@code{respawn}) or not (@code{off}), and the fourth field specifies the
full path of the program to run.

The following options are available for @code{mgetty}:

@samp{-x @var{<level>}} sets the debugging level. This is very important
for diagnosing problems, as with higher levels, @code{mgetty} will write
very detailed informations about its internal workings to its log file.

@samp{-s @var{<speed>}} sets the port speed. If not specified, the default
from @file{policy.h}, (definition @code{DEFAULT_PORTSPEED}) will be used.

@samp{-k @var{<space>}} sets the minimum number of kbytes required
on the incoming FAX spool directory.  If there isn't this much space
in the spool directory, the connection is terminated.  The default
is 1 megabyte.

@samp{-m @var{'expect send ...'}} sets the modem initialization sequence.
  
@samp{-r} for direct lines (no modem chats are done)

@samp{-p @var{<login prompt>}} sets the login prompt (various escapes are
allowed)

@samp{-n @var{<rings>}} sets the number of @code{RING} messages to expect
before sending @code{ATA} to answer the phone. Default is one @code{RING}.

@samp{-R @var{<sec>}} tells mgetty to enable ``ring-back'' or
``ring-twice'' mode. This means that mgetty won't pick up a call
immediately, but the caller has to hang up after the first ring, and
call again in the next @var{<sec>} seconds.

@samp{-i @file{/etc/issue}} specifies the issue file to display before 
prompting for login.

@samp{-S @file{<fax_document>}} specifies the document(s) to send to
polling fax machines (full path required). @file{<fax_document>} has to be
in G3 format (as for @code{sendfax}), or a text file listing G3 fax files
(one file per line).

A sample entry in @file{/etc/inittab} might look like this:

@example
F1a:23:respawn:@SBINDIR@/mgetty -x 3 tty2a
@end example

For a more detailed explanation of all the options, please look into the
@file{mgetty(1)} man page.

@node Devices, Logs, Inittab, mgetty
@section Choosing the right device

Some operating systems provide two separate devices for each serial
line, one of which is intended especially for gettys. This is
@emph{NOT} a good idea, because it won't work with @code{mgetty}. It is
meant for modems used in auto-answer mode.

@code{mgetty} picks up the phone by hand, this will only work properly
if you use the @emph{same} device you would use for dialing out. (Some
people like to create a symlink @file{/dev/modem} for this, but you
have to be consistent and use this for @emph{all} comm programs if you
do - otherwise you'll run into problems with the lock file names).

Here are some examples for different systems:

@itemize @bullet
@item
SV Unix systems using the FAS serial driver:

Use @code{ttyF01} etc., (minor number 80+(port number). Do @emph{not}
use @code{ttyFMxxx}---mgetty will open the device anyway, but then an
open to the ``normal'' port (without carrier detect) will block.

@item
SCO Unix systems with the stock serial driver:

Use the modem-control port (@code{tty2A}), @emph{not} @code{tty2a}, because
hardware flow control and carrier detection do not work on ``lowercase''
tty devices.

The same holds for ``smart'' serial boards, as specialix, digiboard,
@dots{}, because they mimic the behaviour of SCO's sio driver.

@item
Linux:

Use @file{/dev/ttyS*}, @emph{not} @file{/dev/cua*}. @xref{Linux}.

@item
SunOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD:

Use @file{/dev/cua*}, not @file{/dev/ttyS*}. Don't ask me why it has to be
this way, but the other way won't work. (On SunOS or Solaris, you can
find some gory details in the @code{man zs} man page).

@end itemize

@node Logs, Deny, Devices, mgetty
@section Log files

@code{mgetty} will normally write all actions into a logfile, named
@file{LOG_PATH.@var{<device>}} (LOG_PATH is defined @file{policy.h}),
e.g. @file{@LOG_PATH@}, so you can easily see what's happening in your
system. (If a fatal error
occurs, the error message is also written to the console, and if that
is not possible, mailed to @samp{ADMIN}). The name of the log file can be
changed in @file{policy.h}.

If @code{mgetty} is compiled with @code{-DSYSLOG}, auditing and error log
messages will also go to @code{syslog} (if your system supports it).

@node Deny, Direct, Logs, mgetty
@section Denying logins

If you want to prevent mgetty from accepting calls, you can do so by
creating a file called @file{/etc/nologin.@var{<device>}}
(e.g. @file{/etc/nologin.tty2a}). If mgetty detects an incoming call, and
sees this file, it will @emph{NOT} answer the phone. This way the caller
does not lose money for a useless call when logins are not allowed
anyway. (You can change the filename that is checked by changing
@code{NOLOGIN_FILE} in @file{policy.h})

This can be used for quite sophisticated scheduling purposes - imagine a
modem attached to a line used for voice during the daytime. So, you want
the modem only to answer the phone during 9 pm and 7 am. What you do is to
have @code{cron} create a @file{/etc/nologin.@var{device}} file at 7 am (so
the modem won't answer the call during the day) and remove it at 9 pm (so
the modem can answer the phone at night).

Naturally, this can be easily extended - e.g., answer the phone only on
weekends (similar cron job), don't answer the phone if there are less
than 5 Mbyte free on disk (have a process check for free disk space
regularily and create @file{/etc/nologin.*} file(s) accordingly), @dots{}

@node Direct, Interaction, Deny, mgetty
@section Direct serial lines

If you have a direct serial line between two unix machines, or a unix
machine and something else, and want to run a getty program on the unix
side that should not interfere with outgoing traffic (e.g.: two unix
machines, both sides running gettys, both sides able to initiate an uucp
connection), you can also use mgetty. Start it with the @samp{-r} flag (as
with uugetty), and it will not try to initialize the modem or wait for
RINGs. It will just sit silently on the port and wait@dots{} You won't see
@file{/etc/issue} on the other side until mgetty gets at least one
character, this prevents two mgettys from talking to each other.

This may be valid for leased lines with modems in leased line mode as well,
but that may depend on your modem setup.

@node Interaction, Caller-ID, Direct, mgetty
@section Interaction between @code{mgetty} and other programs

Normally, after a caller enters his login name, @code{mgetty} calls
@code{@LOGIN@} to do the password checking and system login.

In some special cases, you may want to call other programs instead of
@code{@LOGIN@}. For example, you could want to call
@code{/usr/lib/uucp/uucico -L <username>} for all login names starting with
@samp{U*} (to have @code{uucico} do the authentication, works only with
taylor uucp 1.05 or taylor uucp 1.04 with my patch in
@file{patches/taylor.p1}), or @code{/usr/lib/fnet/ifcico} for incoming
FidoNet calls (using @code{ifcico} from Eugene Crosser's @file{ifmail}
package).

@code{mgetty} can do all this. It's controlled by a configuration file
@file{login.config}, normally located in
@file{@CONFDIR@/} (definition @code{LOGIN_CFG_FILE} in
@file{policy.h}). I have provided a sample file with lots of comments,
please look into that file for the syntax to use. To make @code{mgetty}
understand incoming fido calls, you have to compile it with @code{-DFIDO}.

If you are worrying about security, you can also use this mechanism: just
call @code{@LOGIN@} only for trusted, known users, and @code{/bin/false}
for every other login name - so, only those listed in @file{login.config}
will be able to log in.

This mechanism can also be used to automatically start up a @code{PPP}
server if an incoming client sends PPP packets.  This feature is called
@emph{AutoPPP}.  For it to work, you have to compile @code{mgetty} with
@code{-DAUTO_PPP} (added to CFLAGS in Makefile).  After this,
@code{mgetty} will detect incoming PPP packets, and run the program that
is specified in @file{login.config} by the special user name
"/AutoPPP/".  See the sample @file{login.config} file for an example.

Which options should be specified depends on your PPP server program and
your local setup.  Don't ask me about that -- I wouldn't know.  Instead,
please check the relevant man pages.

@node Caller-ID, runtime-mgetty, Interaction, mgetty
@section Using Caller-ID to selectively accept or reject calls

Some telephone companies provide a service to the subscriber, called
``Caller ID'', where the phone number of the caller is transmitted while
your phone is ringing. Not all providers support it, and you'll have to
ask for it.

If your modem is able to retrieve callerid information, and @code{mgetty}
is compiled with @code{CNDFILE} defined in @file{policy.h}, @code{mgetty}
can check the caller's number before answering the phone. (Right now, it
works for most variants out there, ZyXEL, Rockwell, ELSA and isdn4linux
among them).  If @code{CNDFILE} is undefined, or if the
file specified does not exist, all calls will be allowed.

One important thing: for most analog modems, you @strong{must} set the
number of RINGs to wait for to two (2) or higher (set @samp{rings 2} in
@file{mgetty.config}), because the ID code is sent between the first and
the second RING. If mgetty picks up the phone too soon, the modem can't
get this information.

Whether a call is accepted or denied is controlled by the configuration file
set with @code{CNDFILE} in @file{policy.h}. The usual default is
@file{@CONFDIR@/dialin.config} (a sample file is installed per default).

That file contains a series of tokens separated by newlines, commas, tabs
and spaces. The callerid number is compared with each token in turn, until
a match occurs. A match occurs when the token compares equally to the
callerid information up to the length of the token.  If the token is
prefixed with a ``!'', a match means ``do not answer the phone''. The token
``all'' matches any telephone number, and will terminate scanning of the
cndfile. If no callerid number is present, it is assumed to have the value
``none''. A line starting with ``#'' is a comment.  There is an implicit
``all'' at the end of the file.
 
For example:

@example
	# list of my friends' data lines
	3433535, 7445343, 5551212
	# dad's fax
	4164646777
	# disallow [other] calls from numbers matching the following prefix:
	!416
	# disallow that speed dialer that keeps hitting my machine
	!3444444
	# allow all calls with the following prefixes
	832, 555
	# don't allow calls when there's no callerid:
	!none
	# It's okay to accept calls from out of area
	# ("OUT_OF_AREA" token seems ZyXEL specific)
	OUT_OF_AREA
	# disallow all other calls
	!all
@end example

For the future, Chris Lewis is planning on adding special modem initialization
strings (e.g., 2400 bps only, fax-only, ...) dependant on the caller
number.


For most applications, this kind of static configuration is enough.  If
you have special needs, you can choose to run an external program to
decide this.  The program name is configured with the @code{cnd-program}
statement in @file{mgetty.config}.  Its command line arguments are:

@example
  <program> <tty> <CallerID> <Name> <dist-ring-nr.> <Called Nr.>
@end example

@code{CallerID} is the number of the caller, if known, or @samp{none}, if
not.  @code{Name} is the name of the caller, or empty ('') if unknown. 
@code{dist-ring-nr.} is the RING type, if you have ``distinctive
RING'' on your telephone line and your modem supports this, or ``0'' 
for an unidentified call.  @code{Called Nr.} is the number that was called
(this is only meaningful if you have ISDN, and your modem signals the
complete number called to the host - e.g. ELSA or ZyXEL 2864I do that).

For example, a call from 12345 to 56789, using ISDN, coming in on ttyS3, 
could lead to a program called like this:

@example
  check.cnd ttyS3 12345 '' 0 56789
@end example

The program return value decides whether the call should be accepted.
Currently, the following values are defined:

@display
 0 - accept call, no specific preferences
 1 - reject call
@end display

Future versions will allow external selection of the way mgetty/vgetty is
supposed to answer the call (data/voice/fax/...), but that's not
implemented yet.

Note: this can not only be used to decide whether to accept a call or not.
You could as well use it to display the caller ID on an external LCD
screen, in an X11 window, print it, initiate a D-Channel Callback, or do 
whatever you want that needs the Caller ID data.

@strong{Note2: be careful what kind of programs you call! They run with
user id 0 (root), so that could easily be a security risk if you're not
careful.}

@node runtime-mgetty,  , Caller-ID, mgetty
@section Runtime configuration for mgetty: @file{mgetty.config}

@code{Mgetty} works quite well with the compiled-in defaults (it has been
the only way to configure it for a long time), but that's quite unflexible,
and especially if you use different modem types, it's extremely unhandy.
The built-in defaults can be modified by command line options, but that's
not perfect either, because it makes @file{/etc/inittab} entries very long
and difficult to read.

If compiled with @emph{config file} support (define @code{MGETTY_CONFIG} in
@file{policy.h}), @code{mgetty} can use a configuration file, quite similar
to those which "Taylor UUCP" uses, which make dynamic setup far easier.

The config file is usually located in @file{@CONFDIR@/} and named
@file{mgetty.config}. Its format is very simple. Each line contains one
keyword, and possibly arguments for it, separated by whitespace. Empty
lines, and comment lines (lines starting with @samp{#}) are allowed.

The config file is grouped into port-specific sections, separated by
@code{port @var{<tty-name>}} lines. Everything before the first @code{port}
line specifies global defaults, everything between two @code{port}
statements specifies configuration items valid only for exactly this
device. Let me show you an example:

@example
# global defaults:
# fax station id is always the same
fax-id ++49-89-1234
# per port stuff
port tty1a
# This modem can't fax
modem-type data

port tty2a
# more verbose logging for this modem
debug 9
@end example


The data part of each line, following the keyword, can be a string (in most
cases), a chat sequence (a series of strings, separated by whitespace, that
specify the "modem talk" to do. It starts with "expect" string, then "send",
then "expect" again, and so on), an integer (interpreted as decimal, octal
or hexadecimal, depending on the leading character [1-9/0/0x]), or boolean
(@samp{y(es)} or @samp{t(rue)} vs. @samp{n(o)} or @samp{f(alse)}). If
no argument is specified, this will be considered ``value not set'' (if
allowed) or ``error'' (if value is mandatory), except for boolean values.
In that case, it's interpreted as @samp{true}.


Many of those configuration items can be overriden from the command line.
In that case, command line options take precedence over configuration file
settings (and those take precedence over built-in defaults). In many cases,
the built-in defaults can be set in @file{policy.h}.

The available configuration items are (command line options, if available,
given in brackets):

@itemize @minus
@item @code{speed} [-s] @var{port speed}

Specify, as integer value, the port speed to use. Default is
@code{DEFAULT_PORTSPEED}. If the given speed is not valid, @code{mgetty}
complains loudly and exits.

@item @code{switchbd} @var{fax recv. speed}

Some modems, mainly Rockwell chipsets, switch to 19200 bps when entering
fax mode. Others may need other speed switches (but I know none).  If your
modem is Rockwell based, try @code{switchbd 19200} if fax reception doesn't
work. (@strong{Warning:} if this is set wrongly, fax reception will
definitely fail. For most sane modems, you do @strong{not need} this.).
Default is @code{FAX_RECV_SWITCHBD}.

@item @code{direct} @var{yes/no} [-r]

Tells mgetty that it is running on a direct line. Mgetty won't try to
initialize any modem, nor will it wait for @samp{RING}. It will just wait
for any character, and then output the issue file and login prompt. This
option is used if you want to connect to machines via nullmodem cable.
Default is @var{no}, since @code{mgetty} is designed for modems@dots{}

@item @code{blocking} @var{yes/no} [-b]

Tells mgetty to open the device in @samp{blocking} mode, that is, the
@code{open()} system call won't succeed until carrier detect is set. This
is set if @code{mgetty} is called as @code{getty}. I'm not sure whether
it's very useful, but I include it for completeness. Default is @var{no}.

@strong{Do not activate this unless you understand all implications!}

@item @code{port-owner} @var{username/userid}

If set, mgetty will @code{chown} the tty line to the given username (you
can specify a string or an integer uid, but the integer must be valid).
This is highly recommended for security purposes: only give port access to
those users you trust not to misuse your modem lines! Default is
@code{PORT_OWNER}.

@item @code{port-group} @var{groupname/gid}

If set, mgetty will @code{chgrp} the tty line to this group id (which can
be given as group name, or as integer gid). If it's not given, or not
valid, the primary group id of @samp{port-owner} will be used. Default is
@code{PORT_GROUP}.

@item @code{port-mode} @var{permissons}

Specifies the permissions to @code{chmod} the device to. @strong{Never}
make a modem device world-accessible, better use @samp{0660} or even
@samp{0600}. Default is @code{PORT_MODE}.

@item @code{toggle-dtr} @var{yes/no}

Tells mgetty whether it should lower the DTR line upon startup to reset
modem. Default is @samp{yes}, but some (few) modems react allergic to that
and crash.

@item @code{toggle-dtr-waittime} @var{msecs}

Specifies the time to hold the DTR line low. Default is 500 milliseconds.

@item @code{data-only} @var{yes/no} [-D]

Tells @code{mgetty} to forget about faxing and only use the data part of
the modem. Default is @samp{false}. You need this if your modem can't
distinguish incoming fax and data calls.

@item @code{fax-only} @var{yes/no} [-F]

Tells @code{mgetty} to put the modem in fax-only mode. You need this if
your modem can't distinguish incoming fax and data calls, but you need fax
more important than data; and you need it if you want to disable data calls
for security reasons (this could be achieved via @file{login.config} as well)

Watch out: if you have setup some unusual @code{answer-chat}, incoming 
calls might still come through. So check your setup!

@item @code{modem-type} [-C] @var{mtype}

Specifies the kind of modem connected to the port. Default is
@code{DEFAULT_MODEMTYPE}. Valid options are:

@itemize @bullet
@item auto

Mgetty will detect the modem type itself (which may occasionally be not
desirable, or it may fail on old modem equipment).  Mgetty will use 
the @code{ATI} command to find out the modem type, and select the proper
fax class accordingly.  If that fails (unknown modem type), mgetty will
try class 2.0 and then class 2.

@item c2.0

Modem is a @var{class 2.0} fax mode. Works better than class 2, if both are
available, because its better standardized. Known to work with USR, ZyXEL
1496 and 2864 series, and ELSA modems.

@item cls2

Modem is a @var{class 2} fax modem, mgetty will not try class 2.0.

@item c2.1

Modem conforms to the new ITU T.32 standard (class 2.1).  To my knowledge,
there are no such modems available yet, but supporting them will be easy
as class 2.1 is very similar to class 2.0.

@item cls1

Modem can only do class 1 fax.  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.  (And not recommended
anyway).

@item c1.0

Modem can do class 1 fax conforming to ITU T.31 standard.  This isn't 
much better than class 1 (use class 2 / 2.0 if available!), but is better
standardized.  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

@item cls2ok

(obsolete, use @code{modem-quirks 02})

@item data

Do not try fax initialization, same as if @samp{-D} given.
@end itemize

There is no way (yet) to tell mgetty to use @strong{only} fax mode and
refuse data calls with this option, use the @code{fax-only true} statement
for that.

@item @code{modem-quirks} @var{bitmask}

Some modems have a very peculiar interpretation of the fax standards. 
Some of the internal operations of @code{mgetty+sendfax} can be adapted
to that.  The argument is a number, constructed from valies in
@file{fax_lib.h}, one bit per "quirk".  Usually you won't need this 
option, because those modems really needing it are auto-detected and
handled properly anyway.

Right now, the following quirks are defined:
@display
0x01  leave the modem in class 2 mode instead of switching
      to class 0 before sending ATA (you might try this if
      adaptive fax/data answer doesn't work).
0x02  class 2 bit order is correct (MultiTech) - unimplemented
0x04  do not trust +FPTS:x,lc,blc values
0x08  do not wait for XON character when sending pages
0x20  AT+FCC/+FMINSP bug workaround for (very) old USR Courier V.32
0x40  display incoming informations about 'non standard frames' - this
      might be necessary on some USR modems to work around logic bugs
@end display

@item @code{init-chat} [-m] @var{expect send expect send ...}

Tells mgetty the chat sequence to use for initializing the modem.
@strong{Warning}: the sequence starts with @strong{expect}, which will in
most cases be @samp{""} (nothing). This ordering was chosen because UUCP
does it this way, and I wanted to avoid confusion here.

Example:

@example
init-chat "" ATQ0E1V1H0 OK ATL0M0S0=0 OK AT&K3 OK
@end example

@item @code{force-init-chat} @var{expect send expect send ...}

In some cases, the modem can get stuck in a mode where it won't react to a
simple @code{AT} command. Usually this happens because the modem is set to
ignore a DTR drop and still has a data connection to the other side. If
you use a voice modem, it could be stuck in voice mode.

In these situations, the normal @code{init-chat} will time out, because
the modem won't send the proper responses back.

To get the modem back into a sane state, you can use the
@code{force-init-chat} chat sequence. The default setup will send
the DLE ETX characters, to get voice modems back to life, and then the
@code{(pause)+++(pause)ATH0} sequence to get the modem back from data
mode to command mode. 

You could prepend this sequence to @code{init-chat} (it wouldn't harm),
but especially the pauses around the +++ sequence makes this undesirable
slow.

@item @code{post-init-chat} @var{expect send expect send ...}

Some modems forget parts of their settings when going from data to fax
mode and back during modem initialization.  For example, some USR models
forget the settings of ``Caller ID delivery'' (AT#CID=1), and some ELSA
modems forget their current DTE port speed when going from voice to data
mode, thus leading to RING messages being delivered with the wrong baud
rate.

For those modems, you can use this command to set up some AT commands that
are executed after all other fax and voice initialization has been done.
Be careful with what you do!  If you send an ATZ (modem reset) or 
something similar here, all your fax/voice settings will be lost!

@item @code{modem-check-time} @var{seconds}

Some modems have the nasty tendency to crash silently. With this option,
you tell @code{mgetty} to check every @var{seconds} seconds with a simple
@samp{AT...OK} sequence whether the modem still reacts. If not,
@code{mgetty} will restart itself and do a full modem reset. Default is @code{MODEM_CHECK_TIME}

@item @code{rings} [-n] @var{nnn}

Sets the number of @code{RING} messages to wait for, before mgetty picks up
the phone. Default is 1. @strong{Warning:} if your modem auto-answers, for
whatever reason, set this to something @strong{different} than the value
set with @code{ATS0=mmm}, otherwise the modems autoanswer and mgettys
manual answer will collide (most modems hang up if a command is received
during auto-answer)

@item @code{msn-list} @var{msn1 msn2 msn3...}

If you have an ISDN modem that signals the called party number (MSN) to
the host, you can use this statement to map the MSN numbers to distictive
RINGs.  The MSN called will be compared the list, and the first match is
used for the distinctive RING number.  The list is searched from left to
right.

This is known to work with ELSA and ZyXEL ISDN terminal adaptors.

@item @code{get-cnd-chat} @var{chat sequence}

This is needed if you have a modem that supports ``caller ID'' detection,
but needs a special command to get the CID information. Right now, this is
only needed for some ELINK ISDN adaptors (@pxref{Elink-ISDN}), most other
CID-capable modems send the CID on their own and don't need this.

Don't forget to set @code{rings} to at least 2, otherwise the CID grabbing
code won't work.

@item @code{cnd-program} @var{pathname}

Specify a program to be run before answering an incoming call.  Use this
if the static Caller ID selection in CNDFILE (policy.h) is not sufficient,
or if you want to use the Caller ID data for other purposes (displaying,
for example).  @xref{Caller-ID}.

@item @code{answer-chat} @var{chat sequence}

This is the command sequence that is used to answer a phone call. Usually
you can leave it at the default @samp{ "" ATA CONNECT \c \r }, but for
some modems you need @samp{ATS0=1} in place of @samp{ATA} (ATA not
allowed). The extra @samp{\r} expect string is needed that the code can
grab the full @var{CONNECT xyz\r} string. It will work without the \r,
but then the logging information will be less detailed. @strong{Right now,
\r won't work at all, it's not implemented yet. Don't use it.}

@item @code{answer-chat-timeout} @var{secs}

During the @var{answer-chat}, each "expect" string must be seen in the time
specified here. Default is 80 seconds. This time should be at least some 5
seconds longer than the time set with the @code{ATS7=...} modem setup
command.

@item @code{autobauding} @var{yes/no} [-a]

Some modems switch their DTE line speed to the communication line speed
after connecting, e.g., after sending @samp{CONNECT 2400}, the modem
switches to 2400 bps. Newer modems usually have a switch to "lock" a DTE
baud rate, which is strongly recommended. If your modem insists on doing
this speed switch, setting @code{autobauding} to @var{true} will make
mgetty behave accordingly.

@item @code{ringback} @var{yes/no} [-R]

If you have to put your modem and your telephone on the same phone line,
you can switch on "ringback" or "ring-twice". This means, mgetty won't
answer the phone on the first call, but remember the call, and pick up on
the second call (if it comes in the time specified by @code{ringback-time}).

@item @code{ringback-time} @var{secs}

This setting specifies how much time may pass between the first and the
second call if "ringback" is active. Default is 30 seconds.

@item @code{ignore-carrier}

If your Modem does not assert the DCD (carrier detect) line, or the
serial port or cable or serial driver is broken, it is possible that
@code{mgetty} or @code{login} will block after a successful CONNECT
(that means: everything seems to work, but suddenly nothing is sent
to the port anymore. Depending on the operating system used, this can
be before printing the @file{/etc/issue} file or not before printing
the @samp{password:} prompt.

To work around this, you can switch off the carrier detection in the
kernel: set @code{ignore-carrier true}. Default is @code{false}.

@strong{WARNING:} If you use this, your system won't be able to detect
when a caller just hangs up instead of cleanly logging out. This may
result in hanging modems, etc.

@item @code{issue-file} [-i] @var{file}

This is the file printed before the login prompt. Default is
@samp{/etc/issue}.  Some special characters are substituted by connect
speed, date, etc. - see below (login-prompt) for a list.  

Note: maximum line length after substitution is 300 characters, so be 
careful with ASCII art banners with lots of color settings and such.

@item @code{prompt-waittime} @var{msecs}

This specifies how long @code{mgetty} will wait for modem and line to
settle down before printing issue file and login prompt. Default is 500
milliseconds.

@item @code{login-prompt} [-p] @var{prompt}

This specifies the login prompt that mgetty will output. Some special
characters in this string (and in the issue file, btw) are recognized and
replaced by something else:

@itemize @bullet

@item @@ system name
@item \n newline
@item \r carriage return
@item \g bell
@item \b backspace (ascii 010)
@item \f form feed (ascii 013)
@item \t TAB
@item \s operating system (OS)
@item \m hardware name
@item \V OS version
@item \R OS release
@item \P (and \L) port name (e.g. ttyS0)
@item \C date and time, in "ctime()" format
@item \I Connection string (e.g. 2400/REL)
@item \N (and \U) number of users currently logged in
@item \S Port speed (e.g. 38400)
@item \D current date in dd/mm/yy format
@item \T current time in hh:mm:ss format
@item \Y CallerID of the current caller
@item \@var{digit} character with the specified octal code
@end itemize

The maximum lenght of the login prompt is limited to 300 characters (after
expansion).

@item @code{login-time} @var{secs}

This specifies the maximum time the user can take to log in. If no login
has occured after that time, @code{mgetty} will hang up. Default is
@code{MAX_LOGIN_TIME} from @file{policy.h}.

@item @code{fido-send-emsi} @var{yes/no}

Only relevant when mgetty was compiled with @code{-DFIDO}. Controls
whether mgetty should send a FidoNET style ``EMSI_REQA77E'' packet before
prompting for login. Default is on. Switch this off if you have FIDO
support compiled in but experience weird problems with some PPP clients
(or users!) being confused by that string.

@item @code{login-conf-file} @var{pathname}

Specifies the path and filename of the 'login.config' file that tells 
mgetty which program to call for login.  See the example login.config 
file to get some ideas what to do with it.

The file name given will be ignored for security reasons if the file is
not owned by 'root', or is readable or writeable by anybody else than
'root' (that is, it must be mode 0600 or 0200).

@item @code{fax-id} [-I] @var{local fax number}

This sets the fax station ID used in fax mode to identify your site to the
caller (usually this is simply your fax phone number). Default is
@code{FAX_STATION_ID}.

@item @code{fax-server-file} [-S] @var{poll control file}

Specifies the fax file(s) that is to be sent if someone else calls your
modem in @emph{fax polling mode}, that is, the caller @emph{receives} a
document.  

Normally, the file given is a text file, containing the list of G3 files to
send to the calling machine, one file per line. Comment lines (starting
with ``#'') are ignored. For backward compatibility, @code{mgetty} does
check whether the named file is a G3 file itself, in which case this file
is sent directly (but then, you can only send one page).

Not all modems support fax poll @emph{server} mode, I know that the ZyXEL
and MultiTech do, and USR does not.

@item @code{diskspace} [-k] @var{kbytes}

This setting tells mgetty the minimum amount of disk space that has to be
available in the fax spool directory for fax reception to be allowed.
Default is 1 Mbyte.

@item @code{notify} @var{mail address}

This is the address that will get mails if a fax is received.  If you do
not want e-mail notification, specify @code{notify} without an e-mail
address.

@item @code{fax-owner} @var{username/uid}
@item @code{fax-group} @var{groupname/gid}
@item @code{fax-mode} @var{perms}

Similar to @code{port-owner/group/mode}, these settings specify the owner,
group and file mode mgetty will use for incoming faxes. Defaults are taken
from @code{FAX_IN_OWNER}, @code{FAX_IN_GROUP}, and
@code{FAX_FILE_MODE}.

@item @code{fax-spool-in} @var{dir1:dir2:dirn}

Specifies a directory, or list of directories, where incoming faxes are
saved.  Multiple directories are tried in order until, the first one
that has enough disk space and is writeable is used.

The default setting is taken from @code{FAX_SPOOL_IN} in the Makefile
usually @code{@FAX_SPOOL_IN@:/tmp} (/tmp is used as fallback).

@item @code{debug} [-x] @var{debug level}

This sets the amount of logging @code{mgetty} will do. A good value is
@var{4}, more details are seen with @code{5}, and @code{9} is really noisy.
Try it! The log data is written to the file specified by @code{LOG_PATH} in
@file{policy.h}, usually this is something like @file{@LOG_PATH@}.

@item @code{gettydefs} @var{gd tag}

If you use the gettdefs feature of @code{mgetty} -- which is @emph{not}
recommended! -- this specifies the gettydefs tag to use for the given line.
See @var{man gettydefs}, @var{man mgettydefs}.

@item @code{term} @var{terminal type}

If you are on Linux or similar OSes that have @code{getty} set the
@code{TERM=xxx} terminal type variable, and have no other method to set it
(e.g. from @file{/etc/profile} or @file{$HOME/.profile}), @code{mgetty} can
do it for you. Just specify @samp{@code{term} vt100} or so. I don't think
it's a good idea to specify the terminal type on a per line base (what if
all your callers use different terminal types?), so the default is
@var{unset}.

@chapter Fax Operations

Both mgetty and sendfax deal exclusively with raw ``g3'' fax files (``g3''
stands for ``group 3'', which is the CCITT standard for encoding images for
fax transmission). You will have to use external programs to create, view
or print these.

There are two kinds of g3 files, the high resolution type with 204x196
dpi and the low (``normal'') resolution ones with 204x98 dpi.  If you
mix up the two, the recipient will get a fax page that is either twice
or half the proper length. You have been warned.

The width of a fax page is always 1728 pixels, the length is arbitrary
(though there are some plain paper fax machines out there that limit the
page length to A4 paper). A typical full page has a length around 2100
pixels in high-resolution mode.

@section Converting fax files

I recommend getting the @samp{pbmplus} package written by Jeff Poskanzer,
which includes lots of small programs to convert various bitmap formats
into a portable intermediate format (@code{pbm}) that can easily be
converted to fax format with the @code{pbm2g3} program. Further, it comes
with lots of tools to scale, flip, and otherwise manipulate the @code{pbm}
bitmaps. Be warned: it includes its own version of G3 conversion programs
(@code{pbmtog3} and @code{g3topbm}), so be careful which one you use.
The programs in the @code{mgetty} package (@code{pbm2g3} and
@code{g32pbm}) behave slightly different (that is, they work!), and are 
significantly faster.  Note that the @code{pbmplus} package does not 
include a graphical front end.

The @file{pbmplus} package can be found on most major FTP sites, e.g. on
ftp.x.org in the @file{/contrib} directory. @xref{ftp}.

If you want to view the images using X11, you should get one of the many
image viewers, like @samp{xview}, @samp{xloadimage} or @samp{xv}.
@xref{Fax-Tools}. A simple, but very fast fax viewer can be found in
@file{mgetty/frontends/X11/}.

Here are some examples for viewing fax files using @code{g32pbm}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can print a fax on a PostScript printer (try @samp{lpr -Pps} if you
don't have @samp{lp}):

@example
cat $faxfile | g32pbm | pnmtops -noturn | lp -dest postscript
@end example

@item
or on an Epson-LQ, scaled for fine resolution (use -yscale 1.84 for
normal resolution):

@example
cat $file | g32pbm | pnmscale -xscale 1.76 -yscale 0.92 |\
    pgmtopbm | pbmtodot -360x180| lp -o epson -
@end example

@item
or you could view it using X11 via one of the following commands:

@example
$ viewfax -v $file

$ cat $file | g32pbm >/tmp/fax.pbm ; xloadimage /tmp/fax.pbm

$ g32pbm $file | xv -
@end example

@end itemize

There are three easy ways to create g3 fax files, either use @code{pbm2g3}
(included in this package. Do not use @code{pbmtog3} from the pbmplus 
toolkit. @xref{pbmtog3}.), use GhostScript (GNU Software, can be found on
prep.ai.mit.edu) which contains a ``digifax'' driver that will produce the
required format, or try Chris Lewis' @samp{hp2pbm} package which will
convert HP Laserjet print files into g3 fax files (@code{hp2hig3}
program).

Once you have the right tools, there are lots of ways to create fax files
for a wide variety of applications. Here are some examples:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Ascii files can be converted using @samp{pbmtext | pbm2g3} (use a
@emph{large} font, and don't convert texts longer than about 50 lines).
Alternatively, you can convert ascii files to PostScript using
@samp{psify}, the @samp{pslp.ps} program from the ghostscript
distribution, or similar tools, and feed their output into GhostScript.

@item
PostScript input can be converted by GhostScript (version 2.4 or
higher), using the digifax (@samp{dfaxhigh} and @samp{dfaxlow}) drivers.
It will generate a plain g3 file with a 64 byte additional header, which
will be skipped automatically. (You have to generate separate g3 files,
one per page). 

A typical call to ghostscript would look like this:

@example
gs -sDEVICE=dfaxhigh -sOutputFile=/tmp/fax.g3.%d yourdocument.ps
@end example

Do @emph{not} use the ``tiffg3'' or similar drivers, they will create output
files with headers that sendfax does not understand, thus causing the
receiving fax machine to reject the data (it will assume that the
transmitted headers are garbled data).

If you use Ghostscript version 3.01 and up, you can use the @samp{faxg3}
driver as well, its output is identical to the output of the
@samp{dfaxhigh} driver except for the 64 byte header.  Besides this,
there should not be any difference.

I have observed that with Ghostscript 5.01, the output of the @samp{faxg3}
driver is rendered better than that of the @samp{dfaxhigh} driver. In
addition, the former is compiled-in by default, while the latter is not.
Thus, the default driver used by @code{faxspool} is now (starting with 1.1.7)
the @samp{faxg3} driver.

@item
Bitmaps can be converted using the @samp{pbmplus} tools, but you'll have
to do the proper scaling by hand. Use a pipeline with @code{pbm2g3} at the
end.

@item
@TeX{} dvi files can be converted to PostScript using @samp{dvialw} or
@samp{dvips}. If you want to get the best possible output quality, you can
use Metafont to create a set of 204x196 dpi fonts, which will look a lot
better than scaled 300 dpi fonts (look into @file{contrib/dvi-fax} for
instructions how to do this). You can use the @code{epsf} macros to include
encapsulated PostScript files, e.g. a scanned signature.

@item
Another way for @TeX{} file conversion is Ralf Schleicher's @code{faxdvi}
package, found at
@file{ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/unix/networking/mgetty/faxdvi-1.1.tar.gz}. Don't
ask me about, ask him!

@item
HP-Laserjet files can be translated with Chris Lewis' @file{hp2pbm}
package. It contains a program @code{hp2hig3} that will read
HP-Laserjet @file{PCL4} files and produce G3 output.

@strong{Warning:} the G3 files that hp2hig3 emits lack the leading EOL
code, thus causing @code{sendfax} to complain and possibly fail. As a quick
fix, you can pipe those files through @code{g3cat}, it will fix the data.

@end itemize

A rather crude sample conversion program (@code{faxcvt}) is provided in
the fax directory.

Better conversion, including guessing of the format of the input files,
is done by the @code{faxspool} program, also provided in the fax
directory. @xref{Queuing}.


@node Receiving, Sending, Convert, Fax
@section Receiving faxes

If everything has been set up properly, faxes will be received
automatically. Obviously, mgetty has to be listening to the proper modem
line. Then, if a fax arrives, mgetty will store it in the directory
@code{FAX_SPOOL_IN} (or the directory configured in @file{mgetty.config}, 
@pxref{runtime-mgetty}) and send a mail to @code{MAIL_TO} (defined 
in @file{policy.h}).

The file name format is somewhat tricky (the reason behind it is that I
have to create something unique without using @code{mktemp()}, because that
would make it impossible to find out which pages belong to which fax). It
is:
@example
f<res><seq><line>[-<remote id>].<pagenr>
@end example
@code{<res>} is @code{n} or @code{f}, depending on the resolution of the
fax. @code{<seq>} is a sequence number, 7 digits wide, somewhat related to
the reception time. @code{<line>} are the last two letters of the tty
device, e.g. @file{S1}. If the sending side specified a fax station id,
it comes next, after a leading dash (all blanks are replaced by dashes).
Finally, after a dot, you'll see the page number.


If you want to process incoming faxes automatically, for example, print
them, re-send them to another fax, send them by mail to you when you're on
vacation, you could use what I call ``notify programs'':

If you define @code{FAX_NOTIFY_PROGRAM} in @file{policy.h}, mgetty
will call this program (or shell script) when a fax has been completely
received. It will be called with the following command line arguments:

@example
FAX_NOTIFY_PROGRAM @var{<hangup code>} '@var{<sender id}>' @var{<nr of pages>} \
                   @var{<file name page 1>} @var{<file name page 2>} @dots{}
@end example

@var{<hangup code>} is 0 if the receive was successful, non-zero
otherwise.  @var{<sender id>} is the fax identification string received
from the other side.  @var{<file name page (i)>} is the full path name for
each received page.

A sample command line might look like this:

@example
@BINDIR@/new_fax 0 "+49 89 3243328" 1 @FAX_SPOOL@/ff-01.a123
@end example

In addition, some environment variables are provide: @code{CALLER_ID},
@code{CALLER_NAME}, @code{CALLED_ID} (Caller ID and destination ISDN MSN,
if available and supported by your modem), and @code{DEVICE} (the full 
name of the tty device, if you want to process faxes differently 
depending on the line they came in).

Such a ``notify program'' could print out the fax, convert it into a MIME
metamail and send it away, display it in an X window (this a little bit
tricky), or whatever. (A friend of mine uses it on his Linux box to call a
program that will make the keyboard LEDs blink when a fax has arrived -- as
you can see, maximum flexibility is possible).

I provide a few examples (printing on HP laserjet, mailing as gzip'ed,
uuencoded pbm file, @dots{}) in @file{samples/new_fax.*}


If you have the @code{dialog} shell tool, you can use the @code{faxv}
program (``faxview'') that I provide in @file{frontends/dialog/faxv} to
browse through all faxes in the incoming spool directory, view them, print
them, rename and move them, @dots{}. @file{faxv} is really more a sample
program to show you how to do it, and you have to configure the X11 viewer
and the printing program in the source code, but I use it for my faxes, and
it works. Because of limitations on some operating systems, the list of
faxes displayed is limited to the last 50 faxes received.


@node Sending, Polling, Receiving, Fax
@section Basic @code{sendfax} usage

Sendfax is very primitive---no spool management, no format conversion,
etc.  It is designed to be able to send exactly one fax (consisting of
multiple pages) to exactly one fax machine, but it is usable from
within shell scripts.  Its input are pages in ``g3'' format, either
created with ghostscript or with pbm2g3.

It is called like this:

@example
sendfax [-v] [-n] @var{<phone-number>} @var{<fax page(s)>}
@end example

e.g.

@example
sendfax 0893243328 /tmp/to_gert_1.g3 @FAX_SPOOL_OUT@/picture.g3
@end example

It will then attempt to open the fax device and send all the pages to
the remote fax machine, in the given order.

It will print little or nothing to stdout or stderr, except if it cannot
find or open one of the named files, or if some transmission errors occur.

(There are a few stubs in the code to put headers on the pages at run-time,
but since most class 2 faxmodems do not implement the command set properly,
putting a header on a page does not work with them - because of that, I had
to disable the corresponding code. @code{faxspool} works around this
problem by using @code{g3cat} (@pxref{Fax-Tools}) to ``paste'' a header
line on top of each page)

If you specify @samp{-v}, sendfax will output more verbose progress
messages.

If you specify @samp{-n}, it will try to send the fax data in normal
resolution, default is fine resolution. (No conversion is done, so make
sure that your input data is already in the proper format.)

Detailed reports can be found in the log file (usually
@file{@FAX_LOG@}) --- but they may be of little more than
technical interest since virtually all conversation with the fax modem is
logged. (Nevertheless, if you send me any bug report, @emph{please include
all log files})

@strong{Warning:} Watch sendfax closely when sending the first few
faxes. I had it abort a transfer a couple of times, not being able to
recover and @emph{not} hanging up the modem (the modem was completely
locked up, with the phone line off-hook)! In my case, it was a problem
of the modem that went away when I upgraded the firmware. Very old
ZyXEL releases sometimes stopped the DTE and forgot to re-start it again.

The return codes of the sendfax program were chosen to make it easy for
external programs (i.e. faxrunq) to decide whether to try again or not:

@example
 0: all pages transmitted successful
 1: error on command line
 2: cannot open fax device (typically happens if fax device is
    locked, but could also be a permission problem)
 3: error initializing the modem
 4: dial failed, "BUSY"
 5: dial failed, "NO DIALTONE"
10: dial failed, "ERROR" or "NO CARRIER"
11: waiting for XON failed (should never be seen)
12: transmitting page(s) failed (or polling failed)
15: some catastrophe hit (termination signal or blocked modem)
@end example

If the error code is less than 10, the attempt didn't cost anything, so an
external program should try again to send the files. If it is 10 or higher,
the failed attempt probably cost something, and the program should decide
whether to try again (thus expending more money) or mail the operator and
tell him something went wrong. My @code{faxrunq} program will suspend the
job after five unsuccessful tries with error codes >= 10.

@node Polling, Queuing, Sending, Fax
@section Fax polling using @code{sendfax}

Sendfax can also be used for fax polling (that is, you call someone and
initiate a fax connection, and then @emph{receive} a document. Don't
confuse it with fax-on-demand, this is something different), the syntax is:

@example
sendfax -p @var{<fax-number>}
@end example


or for sending a fax and then switch to polling:

@example
sendfax -p @var{<fax-number>} @var{<send-documents>}
@end example

(in this case @var{<send-documents>} are sent, and then the documents
from the other modem are polled, if there are any)

the received pages are written to the current directory, so make sure
you have write access...


@strong{Warning:} Fax polling does @emph{not} work with ZyXEL Modems
with ROM releases before 6.00 - with the 6.01 and 6.10 Eproms it works,
but 6.11a is broken again. 6.12 and 6.13 work fine.

It definitely doesn't work with some Rockwell-based Faxmodems (Supra), 
since many versions of this chipset does not support polling. Some work,
though, so you simply have to try it.

Could anybody try this with an Everex Faxmodem?


@node Queuing, Fax-Tools, Polling, Fax
@section Automated fax queuing 

For fax spooling and processing the queue, four additional utility
programs are provided:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{faxspool} will spool a number of files (accepting various formats)
and put them into the fax spool directory. Its syntax is:

@example
faxspool [options] phone-number input-file(s)
@end example
  
@samp{phone-number} can be an alias, in this case the private and global
alias files @file{$HOME/.faxnrs} and @file{@CONFDIR@/faxaliases} will be
searched for a line starting with this alias. The remainder of this line
will then be used as fax number.

@code{faxspool} interacts with the @code{file} program and
@file{/etc/magic} to determine the file type of the input files. If your
@file{/etc/magic} lacks entries for the various bitmap files, take a look
at @file{fax/etc-magic}, it contains the most important magic numbers.

@code{faxspool} reads the text to put on top of each fax page from a text
file. The text file is (in order of precedence) the argument of the option
-h, the @file{$HOME/.faxheader} and as system-wide default
@file{@CONFDIR@/faxheader}. This file must
contain pure ASCII text. Some tokens are replaced by the actual values:
@@T@@ becomes the destination phone number, @@P@@ becomes the actual and
@@M@@ the total page number, and @@U@@ is replaced by the user name. If
your fax modem cuts of a few lines on top of each page, it may be a good
idea to put a blank line before the header line itself, and it is also a
good idea to indent the line about 5 spaces.

For the available options, please read the @file{faxspool.1} man page.

@item
@code{faxrunq} will read this directory and try to send all the faxes
queued there (time scheduling is available, but primitive). If faxrunq
succeeds, the fax is deleted and the sender is mailed. If it does not
succeed after five tries (@samp{BUSY} or a locked fax modem do
@emph{not} count for this) it will send a mail and not try any further
to send this fax. (This should prevent your faxmodem from making you
bancrupt@dots{}).

@code{faxrunq} should be called at regular intervals from @code{cron} to
process the queued jobs. It should only be executed by @emph{root}, to
make sure that all the files in the fax spool directory are read- and
writeable.


@item
@code{faxq} will display all entries in the fax queue. If called with
the @samp{-o} parameter, it will also display completed, but not yet
deleted jobs (JOB.done files). If called with the @samp{-v} parameter, the
output will be more verbose.

Jobs that are just being sent are not shown (@code{faxq} doesn't see locked
jobs)

@item
@code{faxrm} can be used to remove fax jobs from the queue. It is called
with the job ids of the to-be-removed faxes as command line argument. The
job ids are those that @code{faxq} returns.

@end itemize

These utilities do still have some rough edges, but I think they are fairly
usable by now.

Earlier variants of those utilities had to be configured in the source
code, from release 0.20 on, this is done by @code{make}. Please check the
scripts nevertheless, whether all directories and files are set up
properly.

@node Fax-Tools, Scanner, Queuing, Fax
@section Additional tools for working with g3 files

Some additional tools are provided for manipulating G3 fax files:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
@code{g3cat} (in the @file{g3/} directory) concatenates multiple G3
fax files. It accepts ``raw'' g3 files and digifax files and outputs a
``raw'' g3 file without headers. Its syntax is analogous to
@code{cat}, except that you @emph{have} to specify @file{-} to read
from @file{stdin}.

@code{g3cat} recognizes two flags: @code{-l}, to separate the fax files
with a thin black line, and @code{-a} to byte-align the end-of-line
codes in the file (Warning: some modems do not like this).

@item
To convert an incoming fax to Jef Poskanzers @file{portable bitmap}
(@code{pbm}) format, you can use the @code{g32pbm} program that is
also provided in @file{g3/}. It's advantages over Jef's
@code{g3topbm} program are that it's approximately five times faster
and takes only one eigth as much virtual memory (on machines with low
virtual memory, it can thus be up to 100 times faster!). Its disadvantage
is that it produces only ``raw'' (i.e., binary) @file{pbm} files; and
it's not as stable when handling erroneous @file{g3} data (means that
if one line is severly corrupted, it can happen that the next line
will not be decoded properly. The rest of the file will then be OK
again).

Syntax:
@example
g32pbm [-r] [-s] [-l] [-d <dpi>] [g3-file]
@end example

If no g3 file is specified, standard input is used.

The @code{-s(tretch)} option causes @code{g32pbm} to double each row of
the g3 file.  You can use this to adjust the aspect ratio of a "normal"
resolution fax file to match that of a "fine" resolution fax.  Of course
you can use other @code{pbmplus} tools for this instead, but 
@code{-s} is sure to be faster.

If you have a HP Laserjet printer, you can make @code{g32pbm} output HP
LJ data with the @code{-l} switch. The desired resolution is chosen with
the @code{-d 75|150|300} switch.

@item
For the other direction, I have provided a @code{pbm2g3} program that will
convert Jef Poskanzer's Portable BitMap format into G3 fax data suitable
for faxing with @code{sendfax}. The @file{pbm} files can be produced by
various sources, e.g. drawing programs (@code{xpaint}), bitmap manipulation
programs (@code{xv}), or simply be converted from other file formats by
means of the @file{pbmplus} tools.

As above, my variant is a lot faster than Jef's, and unlike his, it
produces g3 data that adheres to the T.4 standard (if you don't fiddle too
much with the options...), so you don't have to apply any patches to make
it work together with @code{sendfax}.

Syntax:
@example
pbm2g3 [-r] [-a] [-w page with] [-h blank lines] [pbm-file]
@end example

if no pbm file is specified, standard input is used.

For a detailed description, see the @file{pbm2g3(1)} man page.

@item
@code{viewfax}. To view G3 data files under X11, Frank D. Cringle has
written a very nice and fast tool that will display the files on screen,
turn them, zoom them in and out, @dots{}

The source code can be found in the @file{mgetty/frontends/X11} directory.
It's not (yet) built and installed by default, but it's straightforward.

For a detailed description, see the @file{README} and @file{viewfax.man}
files in that directory.

@item
To convert an incoming fax into X-Windows @file{xwd} bitmaps, you can
use Chel van Gennip's @code{g3toxwd} program, found in the
@file{contrib/} directory.

@item
If you want to print out faxes on a HP laserjet printer, you have two
opions: you can use Chel's @code{g3tolj} program (also in the
@file{contrib/} directory), or you use my @code{g32pbm} program with the
@code{-l} option, which will make it output LJ data.

@end itemize

@node Scanner, runtime-sendfax, Fax-Tools, Fax
@section Using an external fax as a scanner

It is possible to tell mgetty to answer the phone even if it is not
ringing (I call this ``virtual rings''). Just send mgetty a signal
@code{SIGUSR1}, this is usually done with @samp{kill -USR1
@var{<mgetty-pid>}}.  Mgetty will then pick up the phone and try to make a
connection.

If you have a normal fax machine connected to the fax modem, it should
be possible to have that fax machine dial any digit (to turn off the
dial tone), and then have mgetty answer the phone to receive the
``incoming'' fax, thus using the fax machine as scanner without paying for a
call. For a description of an sample setup (thanks, caz!), please see
@file{doc/scanner.txt}.

Whether it works may depend on your phone company's setup, but it should.

If you have a modem that has a @samp{data/voice} button, it should also be
possible to hit that button to make the modem pick up the phone. Mgetty
will automatically notice that and handle it properly. (I've tested this
only with ZyXELs - could somebody else please test this with other modem
types and send me a logfile? Thanks)

@node runtime-sendfax,  , Scanner, Fax
@section Runtime configuration for sendfax: @file{sendfax.config}

Basically, @code{sendfax} can work very well with the compiled-in defaults
(from @file{policy.h}), sometimes slightly modified by command line
options.

If you use more than one fax modem, possibly of different type, this is
very awkward, because the command line will get very long. For that reason,
there is a configuration file which will control nearly every detail of
sendfax' behaviour.

It is usually named @file{@CONFDIR@/sendfax.config}.

The config file consists of multiple sections, separated from each other by
the keyword @samp{port}. All configuration options given before the
first @samp{port} statement specify global options, and everything between
two @samp{port} statements applies only for the device with the given name
(@samp{port} takes an argument). Let me show you an example:

@example
# global defaults:
# fax station id is always the same
fax-id ++49-89-1234
# always have the speaker on
modem-init ATM1L3

# port specific: for /dev/tty1a, switch the speaker off
port tty1a
modem-init ATM0L0

# port specific: for ttyS1, use another fax station id
port ttyS1
fax-id ++1234567
@end example

As you can see, empty lines and comment lines (starting with "#") are
allowed.

Every line in the config file that is not a comment - or empty - starts
with a keyword (listed in detail below), followed by a "data" field. In the
example above, @samp{fax-id} is the keyword, @samp{++49-89-1234} is the
corresponding data, the fax ID for the sending machine. Most data fields
are strings, but there are a few boolean and integer items.

The available keywords are (if it's possible to set this item from the
command line, the flag is given in brackets).

@itemize @minus
@item @code{fax-devices} [-l] @var{ttys}

Sets the fax modems to use, e.g. @samp{tty1a:tty2a}. Default is
@code{FAX_MODEM_TTYS} from @file{policy.h}. The device names given here are
used to look up the corresponding @code{port} section later. Watch out for
upper-/lowercase.

It is not very useful to specify this in the per-port section, so it is
ignored if met there.

@item @code{modem-init} [-m] @var{command}

Specifies an @samp{AT...} command that is to be sent to the modem right at
the @strong{beginning} of all modem talk (even before setting the modem
into fax mode, so this could be an @samp{ATZ} if you want to reset the
modem).

@item @code{modem-handshake} @var{command}

Specifies an @samp{AT...} command that will be sent to the modem at the
@strong{end} of the modem initialization, right before dialing. @strong{Do
not use ATZ or such here}, since resetting the modem will switch off fax
mode. Default is @code{FAX_MODEM_HANDSHAKE}.

@item @code{modem-type} [-C] @var{type}

Force the modem command set to use. Default is @samp{auto} (auto-detect,
which may not work on very cheap modems), possible other values are
@samp{cls2}, for ``class 2 only'' modems, and @samp{c2.0} for ``class 2.0''
faxmodems. Default is @code{DEFAULT_MODEMTYPE}. @xref{runtime-mgetty}.

@item @code{modem-quirks} @var{bitmask}

Same as in @code{mgetty}, this can be used to adapt @code{sendfax} to
some peculiarities in certain modems. @xref{runtime-mgetty}.

@item @code{max-tries} @var{nnn}

Specify the maximum number of tries per page if the receiving end reports
reception errors. If @var{nnn} tries do not suffice to successfully
transmit a page, @code{sendfax} will give up or simply go on, depending on
the setting of @code{max-tries-continue} (see below). If this is set to
@samp{0}, @code{sendfax} will ignore retransmission requests and simply go
on.  Default is @code{FAX_SEND_MAX_TRIES}.

@item @code{max-tries-continue} @var{y|n}

After the maximum number of tries for one page are reached, @code{sendfax}
can report an error and abort (@code{max-tries-continue @var{no}}), or go
on with the next page (@var{yes}).

For ``mission critical'' faxes, I'd set it to @var{no}, but since the page
quality is most often quite good even if reported as ``page bad'', the
default is @var{yes}.

@item @code{speed} @var{baudrate}

Set the port speed to use for fax send operations. Usually, @samp{38400} is
a good choice, but a few dumb modems (for example, some based on rockwell
chipsets) need @samp{19200} or even @samp{9600}. A few modems can go
higher, but @code{sendfax} may not support it, and it may not always work.
Default is @code{FAX_SEND_BAUD}.

@item @code{switchbd} @var{baudrate}

On some (very few) modems it is necessary to start with baudrate "A" and
switch to baudrate "B" after sending the @samp{AT+FCLASS=2} command. If you
specify this, @code{sendfax} will switch from @code{speed} to
@code{switchbd} right after setting the modem to class 2/2.0. Default is
@code{FAX_SEND_SWITCHBD}, I'd recommend @strong{not} using it unless you're
sure that you need it.

@item @code{open-delay} @var{msec}

A few modems respond to raising the DTR line (when opening the device)
with @samp{OK}.  This can confuse @code{sendfax}, because it will see
this OK as response to the next command.  In the log file, you can see if
your modem exhibits this problem if the echo of each @code{AT} command 
can be seen when waiting for the response to the @emph{next} @code{AT} 
command.  With @code{open-delay} you can give a number of milliseconds to
wait after the device is active until sendfax flushes all incoming
responses and goes ahead.

The only modems that need this so far are an ELSA 33.6 and an ELSA
MicroLink 56k, and delaying for about 1500 ms cured the problem.

@item @code{ignore-carrier} @var{y|n}

Some misbehaving modems lower the DCD (carrier detect) line briefly
between sending multiple pages.  Depending on the operating system used,
this may cause all subsequent port accesses on this serial port to fail.
You'll recognize it if you get a ``weird-looking'' sendfax log file that works
fine up to the end of the first page, and then aborts with @samp{I/O
error} or so.

In earlier versions, you could achieve this by setting
@code{FAX_SEND_IGNORE_CARRIER} in @file{policy.h}, but this has been
removed.  Use the config file instead.

Modems where this is known to be necessary include all USR modems
(Courier and Sportsters), some ZyXEL 1496 EG(+), and some GVC models.

The default is @code{ignore-carrier yes}, as there are just too many users
out there to read documentation, and it does less harm that way.

@item @code{dial-prefix} @var{command}

This is the command used for dialing out. Usually this will be something
simple, as @samp{ATD} or @samp{ATDP}, but if you have an unusual setup, it
could also be something like @samp{ATX0DP0;X4DT} (meaning: switch off
dial-tone detection, pulse-dial @samp{0}, back to command mode, switch on
dial-tone detection, and go ahead dialing with touch tones). The phone
number will be sent right after the @code{dial-prefix}. Default is
@code{FAX_DIAL_PREFIX}.

@item @code{fax-id} [-I] @var{your fax phone}

specifies the "fax station id" used to identify your fax machine to the
receiving end. Usually this is the telephone number of your own fax
machine, but if you want to (and if your modem support it), you can put up
to 20 alphanumeric characters here, e.g. @code{+1-11-222 Fred}. Default is
@code{FAX_STATION_ID}.

Watch out: the @code{faxspool} program @emph{only} uses the @emph{global}
definition from sendfax' config file, so the fax id it puts on the header 
might not be the same as the one transmitted by sendfax, if you use port
specific settings for @code{fax-id} in @file{sendfax.config} (Paul Sands).

@item @code{poll-dir} [-d] @var{full path}

This is used to specify a directory where polled faxes (wheather maps and
such) are to be saved into. Default is the current directory.

@item @code{normal-res} @var{y|n} [-n]

If set to @samp{yes} or @samp{true} (boolean), @code{sendfax} won't attempt
to make a fax connection in "fine resolution" mode. Normally you won't need
to use that option, since @code{faxrunq} will set the @code{-n} switch if
needed.  Default is @samp{no}

@item @code{fax-min-speed} @var{speed}

Sets the lowest transmission speed that the modem will negotiate with
the receiving modem. (Not implemented yet).

@item @code{fax-max-speed} @var{speed} [-M]

Sets the maximum transmission speed that the modem will negotiate with the
fax receiver.  Usually, you don't need this, as decent modems will pick
the best speed automtically, but sometimes (e.g. for the USR Courier
series) this doesn't always works, and transmission fails with +FHS:25. 
If you see that error, you might want to try @code{fax-max-speed 7200}.

@item @code{verbose} @var{y|n} [-v]

If set to @samp{yes} or @samp{true}, @code{sendfax} will output progress
reports on stdout, if set to @samp{no}, @code{sendfax} will only print
error and warning messages. Default is @samp{no}.

@item @code{debug} [-x] @var{nn}

controls the amount of information written into the fax log file
(@code{FAX_LOG} in @file{policy.h}). @samp{0} means "totally silent" (not
even errors are written), @samp{9} is really noisy. I usually use @samp{3}
or @samp{4} in normal use, and @samp{6} for debugging. Default is
@code{LOG_LEVEL}.

@item @code{page-header} [-h] @var{file}

Yet unused (because of implementation shortcomings in all tested modems)

@end itemize

To show you how it will look like, I have included a sample
@file{sendfax.config} file below. Three modem lines exist on my system, all
modems have different initialization and flow control commands, and on one
line I have to tell the modem to use pulse dial because the PBX is too old.

@example

@chapter Voice Operations

This chapter explains how you can use mgetty to implement an answering
machine if you have a modem that understands the voice command set
(i.e. the ZyXEL). 

The first version of these extentions was written by Klaus Weidner. 

Since February 1995 these extentions are now developed and maintained 
by Marc Eberhard (Marc.Eberhard@@Poseidon.ThPhy.Uni-Duesseldorf.DE).
Since late 1998, Marc Schaefer (schaefer@@alphanet.ch) took over
vgetty development. Please see
http://www-internal.alphanet.ch/~schaefer/vgetty.html for vgetty
specific information, patches and releases, and please
send email about the voice features to him, not to me.

@strong{I have removed the whole chapter from the documentation for 
now, as the voice stuff has changed too much, but the docs were not
updated accordingly. Please see the programs and examples in the 
@file{voice} subdirectory for ideas how to get it going. Configuration is
explained in @file{voice.conf}}.

The @file{voice} subtree is @strong{NOT} included in the official release
1.0, because of the lack of documentation, and because Marc thinks it's
not stable enough yet.  It @emph{is} included in the 0.99 and 1.1 beta
development trees, so if you want to play with it, get one of those
version. @strong{BUT} keep in mind what ``beta'' means: lacking 
documentation, problems, crashes, whatever.

@subsection Problems common to many modem types

@itemize @bullet
@item
Disable auto-answer in the modem (@code{ATS0=0}), because it will interfere
with the manual answer done by @code{mgetty}. If you @emph{have} to use
auto-answer, set the @code{mgetty} ring-counter (@code{-n <i>}) high enough
that @code{mgetty} will never try to answer the phone manually.

@item
Make sure that your modem is set to return @emph{verbose result codes},
that is, set @code{ATV1}. Otherwise, the modem won't return @samp{CONNECT}
or @samp{RING} but @samp{1} or @samp{2} as result code, and mgetty
definitely doesn't understand that. By default, @code{mgetty} sets
@code{ATV1} automatically, but if you change the init sequence, watch out
for this.

@item
Make sure that your modem is set to the proper dialing type (@code{ATT&W}
for touch-tone, @code{ATP&W} for pulse dialing) --- @code{sendfax} uses
@code{ATD...} to dial out, assuming that the modem knows which dialing
method to use. Alternatively, set @code{FAX_DIAL_PREFIX} in @file{policy.h}
or @code{dial-prefix} in @file{sendfax.config} accordingly.

@item
If the default modem initialization string in @file{policy.h}, which is
quite generic, doesn't work for your modem, you can either change it
according to your needs, or store all settings in the non-volatile RAM
(NVRAM) inside the modem and change the initialization strings to plain
@code{ATZ} (modem reset).

These settings ought to work with most modems:

@code{ATS0=0}: do not auto-answer, @code{E1}: echo on, @code{Q0}: send
modem responses, @code{&D3}: reset on DTR->low.

The following, for example, are ZyXEL specific things:

@code{&H3}: set handshake to RTS+CTS,
@code{&N0}: ``multi-auto'' connect, accept all known protocols,
@code{&K4}: enable v42bis/mnp5 compression.

Naturally, you can use any init string you want (but the modem has to
return OK) --- check with your modem manual.

@item
On USR and some ELSA Modems, it has occasionally been reported that the 
initialization phase runs through fine, but incoming @code{RING} messages 
are not recognized, and mgetty complains about @samp{junk on the line}. 
In all those cases, it were baud rate problems. The modem was initialized 
with an init-sequence of @code{"" ATZ OK} only. Problem with this is, 
after ATZ, the modem changes to the DTE baud rate that the last AT&W 
command was sent with. If that baud rate differs from the @code{mgetty} 
port speed, a RING won't be detected.  Fix is easy: send another 
@code{AT} command after the @code{ATZ}. For example, make the init 
sequence @code{"" ATZ OK AT OK}. The second @code{AT} command will 
set the modem back to the mgetty port speed.

@item
Some modems do not like the @samp{+FDCC=1,5,...} command.

In the latest version, mgetty and sendfax will automatically detect if the
modem isn't able to do 14400 bps for faxing and will use 9600 bps ---
@samp{+FDCC=1,3,...} --- instead. So don't worry about the error message.

@item
Sometimes mgetty cannot initialize the modem, it times out waiting for
the first @samp{OK}. (USR Sportsters are known to hit this).

I assume that the problem is the DTR-induced modem reset before
sending the first @samp{+++ATH} to the modem.
I know that some modems need quite a lot time after a reset, so this
should go away if you add more delays before sending the first string
to the modem:

In @file{conf_mg.c} (line 38 or so) change

@example
char *def_init_chat_seq[] =
           @{ "", "\\d\\d\\d+++\\d\\d\\d\r\\dATQ0V1H0", "OK",
@end example

to

@example
char *def_init_chat_seq[] =
           @{ "", "\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d+++\\d\\d\\d\r\\dATQ0V1H0", "OK",
                   ^^^^^^^^^ additional delays here
@end example

Or, if you don't want to modify the code, just set the @code{init-chat}
sequence in @file{mgetty.config} accordingly.

Alternatively, you can just switch off the toggling of DTR
(since the HUPCL flag is set, it should work as well) by setting
@code{toggle-dtr no} in @file{mgetty.config}.

@item
Some operating systems send their commands too fast for some modems (Linux
is known to do this). In that case it may be necessary to increase the
delay times for @code{DO_CHAT_SEND_DELAY} and @code{FAX_COMMAND_DELAY} in
@file{policy.h}.

@item
Some Modems toggle DCD between pages, possibly correlated to the presence of
the ``high speed'' page transmission carrier. @code{sendfax} normally runs
carrier-sensitive, and will then get a lot error messages in the
@code{read} and @code{write} calls, logging them as @code{I/O Error} or
something similar when sending the first or second page. To work around
this, set @code{ignore-carrier true} in @file{sendfax.config}.

If you run into this problem, @code{sendfax} will complain about
@samp{Error +FHNG:-5 (Unexpected hangup / read() error / write() error)}
and abort.

@item
Some modems do not understand @code{ATH0}, responding with @samp{ERROR} to
that. Just modify the @code{init-chat} setting in @file{mgetty.config} to
send @code{ATH} instead of @code{ATH0}. This will fix it.

@item
Faxing to some modems works very well, faxing to ``normal'' fax machines
fails all the time.

In most cases, this error is caused by badly created G3 files. If you use
the old @code{pbm2g3} program, or an old copy of @code{hp2hig3}, it will
cause bad G3 files. 

Recently, a new problem appeared for postscript files created by certain
programs that insist on setting their ideas of the page size (some
versions of WinWord, FrameMaker, and dvipsk). If used together with
ghostscript 3.*, the resulting G3 file's width isn't correct. For a
fix, try creating the postscript file with a different program, use a
newer version of ghostscript, or an older one (2.62 is fine). Quite often
it helps to add @code{-sPAPERSIZE=a4} to Ghostscript's command line (in
@code{faxspool}).

With a @code{mgetty} version later than June 1996, the @code{g3cat}
program should take care of this problem, fixing the line width
on-the-fly. It will print a warning, to tell you about the problem,
though. So if you get this warning, faxing should work, but you'd better
check all your programs anyway.

@item
Some other Modems cannot (or not properly) distinguish between calling
faxes and calling modems.

Some of them just refuse to answer both, only recognizing one and failing
on the other (NO CARRIER) --- in that case, there's nothing you can do to
make it receive both (except making the manufacturer fix it). What you can
do is to force it to receive always fax or always data (what is more
important for you). Data-Only can be set by the @code{data-only} keyword in
the configuration file, and Fax-Only with the @code{fax-only} keyword.

In some cases, those problems may be caused by the modem forgetting the
@code{AT+FAA=1} command if it receives any other command after it. To fix
it, it may help to change the ``answer chat command'' in the config file to

@example
answer-chat "" AT+FAA=1;A CONNECT \c \r
@end example

if this helps for your modem, please tell me so, and I'll include it into
the documentation.

Some other modems can distinguish the different call types @emph{most of
the time}, but some 2400 bps modems mysteriously fail. That may be caused
by some -- strange -- modems sending a certain tone when @emph{calling} the
other side, and the receiving end mistaking that for the fax calling tone.
Arne Marschall said about that: ``...Or try calling your modem with your
phone and whistle. If it says ``+fcon'' it is one one those which can't
deal with modems using a calling tone'' - try it.

Another, quite simplistic approach of some modem manufacturers is that
they distinguish Fax by waiting until the time specified in register
@code{S7} (time to carrier) runs out, and then switching from data to
fax carrier. That normally works quite well - if the other side is patient
enough to wait that long @dots{}. For example, if the modem
switches to fax after 60 seconds have passed, and the caller has a timeout
of 50 seconds, it will definitely fail. If in doubt, try setting
@code{ATS7=30} (but only if all else fails - and don't ask @emph{me} why it
doesn't work...)

@item
Except if you feel sure that your modem needs less, do not try to
send or receive faxes with a port speed of less than 19200 bps. Since fax
transmission is synchronous (no start and stop bit!), you need at least
12000 bps on the Computer-Modem line to transmit 9600 bps on the line.

@item
For some modems, incoming faxes are detected properly, but mgetty times out
about two minutes later in @code{fax_wait_for(OK)}. Most likely, the
@code{switchbd} (@file{mgetty.config}) speed is set wrongly.  A number of 
cheap modems (e.g. Rockwell-Chip based ones) step to 19200 bps upon fax 
reception, and
setting this option to @samp{19200} will tell mgetty about it. Better
modems have no need for that, so if you have defined it and your modem
does *not* change bit rates, it won't work either.

If you have this problem, your log file for an incoming fax call will look
like this:

@example
09/21 09:55:48 yS1  waiting for ``RING''
09/21 09:55:48 yS1  got: [0d][0a]RING ** found **
09/21 09:55:48 yS1  send: ATA[0d]
09/21 09:55:48 yS1  waiting for ``CONNECT''
09/21 09:55:48 yS1  got: [0d][0a]ATA[0d][0d][0a]FAX
09/21 09:55:50 yS1  found action string: ``FAX''
09/21 09:55:50 yS1  start fax receiver...
09/21 09:55:50 yS1  fax receiver: entry
09/21 09:55:50 yS1  fax_wait_for(OK)
09/21 09:55:56 yS1  fax_wait_for: string '+FCON'
09/21 09:57:50 yS1  Warning: got alarm signal!
09/21 09:57:50 yS1  fax_read_byte: read returned -1: Interrupted system call
09/21 09:57:50 yS1  fax_get_line: cannot read byte, return: Interrupted system call
@end example

@item
For a couple of modems, you can find initialization and setup hints in the
file @file{doc/modems.db}. Just browse through it, maybe you'll find
something helpful. (You're welcome to provide entries for modems not yet
in the list).

@item
Sometimes, very weird things happen upon login (that is, long after
@code{mgetty} has done its work), for example, /bin/login blocks
infinitely, the caller is thrown out immediately again, or the shell won't
notice a logout, etc.

Quite often, this is caused by a modem not setting the data carrier detect
(DCD) line properly (properly meaning here "reflecting the actual line
conditions"). On most modems this is done with the @code{AT&C1} command.

Another possibility are too long or otherwise broken modem cables that
corrupt the signals, and introduce noise on the modem control lines. Flat
cables are famous for this, use round, shielded modem cables, no longer
than necessary.

@item
@code{mgetty} will complain loudly if you switch off your modem.

Well, what should I say, this is a feature :-) -- I think that mgetty
should detect and complain if a modem is not working, and if you switch it
off, it is most definitely not working.

For most modems, there is an easy way out.  @code{mgetty} can query the
modem's DSR line at startup, and wait until that line comes active.  For
that to work, you need to set DSR to ``always on'' with @code{AT&S0&W}
(entered from a terminal program), and then switch on @code{need-dsr yes}
in @file{mgetty.config}.  Check the log file (with @code{debug 6}) to see
whether it's working.  It won't work for old unix systems where you can't
query the state of the serial port control lines (DSR, DCD, etc.).

For modems or unix systems that have problems with DSR, there's another
approach: You just create a file, @file{/etc/nomodem.ttyS1},
or however you want to name it, when you intend to switch off your modem.
Instead of running @code{mgetty} from @file{/etc/inittab}, you run a 
``wrapper'' script that will wait until the nomodem file disappears, 
and then starts @code{mgetty}. That way, you can just prevent
@code{mgetty} from starting when you don't want it to.

The wrapper is easy:

@example
#!/bin/sh
#
while test -f /etc/nologin.ttyS1
do
   sleep 60
   done
exec /usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyS1
@end example

@item
I have been asked about ``superfine'' fax mode recently (using 392/408 dpi
instead the usual 198/204 dpi).  It is not yet implemented.  It would not
be not overly hard, but you need a modem that supports it - no class 2 
modems that I know of support it, and only very few 2.0/2.1 modems 
(MultiTech).  So it hasn't been done yet.

@item
Similar to the last bullet, V34 fax (using transfer speeds up to 28.800
bps) isn't fully implemented yet.  My modems do not support it, and nobody 
has asked for it yet.  It should be really easy, though.

@end itemize


@node Zyxel, TelelinkIMS08, Common, Modems
@subsection ZyXEL

First of all, yes, ZyXELs tend to somewhat non-deterministic behaviour -
most modems work perfectly with @code{mgetty+sendfax}, a few don't, and I
do not always find out what's wrong.

If it works first, and then suddenly stops working, it does quite often
help do to a @strong{full} modem reset, that is, switch it off, press the
DATA/VOICE key, switch it on again and hold the key for about 20 Seconds.
(That's for the 1496E and E+, for other models, it works differently,
check you manual). That cured the problems in many cases.

The same holds true after a firmware change: always do a full modem reset
in case you change the ROM version!

Do not use non-plus ZyXELs (the ``slower'' ones) for faxing with DTE
speeds above 38400 bps, I got a report that it won't work.

Do not use the @code{S18} register, set it to 0. Its purpose is for dumb
@code{getty} programs where the modem has to change its baud rate back to a
certain value if some other program has modified it. Since @code{mgetty}
will reinitialize the modem anyway if another program has dialed out, the
@code{S18} register cannot improve anything, it can only harm (e.g., if it
is set to @code{3}, the modem will send any @code{RING} with 19200 bps ---
imagine what happens if @code{mgetty} sets the port to 38400 @dots{})

If you want to use Caller ID (and have subscribed to it), add S40.2=1 to
the modem initialization string [For the ZyXEL 2864, this might be S84.4=0,
but check with your modem manual!].

@strong{Warning:} If you use a very old ZyXEL and try to send some complex
graphics (the ``tiger.ps'' example file in the GhostScript package is
known to produce this), it may lock up. This is because the old ZyXEL
firmware had @emph{lots} of bugs concerning hardware flow
control---sometimes the ZyXEL just forgot to raise CTS when it can
accept data again. The symptoms are that the transmission hangs, no
modem LEDs are flashing any more, the logfile won't grow any more and
the receiving machines hangs up after printing a partial page.

This bug has been fixed in ROM release 6.01, so you should consider
upgrading your eproms if you run into this. With ROM release 6.01 and
6.11a, it works correctly (a hundred-odd faxes sent without problems).

Rom releases I've never been able to make @code{sendfax} work reliably are
6.00 and 6.10 (6.10a works), and various 5.0x releases.

Fax polling (both server and client side) is broken in ROM 6.11a.

The very latest ROM releases, 6.12, 6.13 and 6.15, work perfectly in every
possible aspect. I tried fax sending, receiving, polling, data calls,
@dots{} - and everything simply @emph{works}!

The latest ZyXEL roms can normally be found on ftp.zyxel.com, in
@file{/pub/other/zyxel/r*}.

Some models, seemingly only the @samp{EG+} (german telekom approved),
toggle the DCD line during the pre-page handshake, thus causing
@code{sendfax} to abort (with a ``I/O error'' during read/write
operations). You can work around this by defining
@code{ignore-carrier true} in @file{sendfax.config}.

ZyXEL modems can do security callback (@code{AT*Gi} with @code{i} > 0).
With ROM releases up to 6.11a, this doesn't interact very well with
mgetty. If you want to use it anyway, send me a note and I'll describe
what to change (but be warned, mgetty operation will become somewhat
unreliable by those changes!). With 6.12, it works very good.

Oh, one additional note: ZyXELs can do voice recording and playback. Klaus
Weidner and Marc Eberhard have written voice handling tools, to turn your
modem into a sophisticated answering machine. Yo can finde this tools in
the @file{voice} subdirectory. (NOTE: In version 1.0, I haven't included
the stuff, because the docs are heavily lacking and Marc thinks it's not
ready yet. Get 0.99 or 1.1-betas to play with voice).

Josef Wolf (jw@@raven.inka.de) has added some comments about the ZyXEL 
Eproms (I don't know whether it's true or not, ask him or 
support@@zyxel.com):

Most EPROMs require /PGM and Vpp to be Vcc while in ROM-Mode. On ZyXELs
these two pins are removed in the socket so the pins are _floating_. This
treatment is @strong{out of spec} for @emph{any} EPROM. The TI-Types 
originally used by ZyXEL seem to tolarate this treatment. But most other 
EPROMS won't work properly. There are two solutions to this problem:

1.) use the types which zyxel used. (could be troublesome to find some)

2.) take two sockets, solder jumpers between pins 1, 31 and 32 (these are
    /PGM, Vpp and Vcc) and place them into the original sockets before
    inserting the EPROMs.

@strong{NEWS:} ZyXEL has a new modem line out in the market, the
@emph{ZyXEL COMET 336} modem.  This is a fairly standard Rockwell-based
junk modem.  It can't do class 2 or class 2.0 fax.  Don't buy it.

@node TelelinkIMS08, Rockwell, Zyxel, Modems
@subsection Telelink IMS 08 Faxline+ Modems

Thanks to friendly support by MVS, Germany, I got a Telelink IMS 08 modem
for testing and was able to adapt @code{mgetty} accordingly.

The modems factory defaults are very good, so it's sufficient for
@code{mgetty} operations to set @code{init-chat} (in @file{mgetty.config})
to @var{ATQ0V1E0 OK AT&F2S0=0&D3X6&K3 OK}, and @code{switchbd} to
@var{19200} (yep, it switches baud rate.  Stupid, but true). After that,
receiving fax + data calls works fine.

Fax sending is not that trivial. Basically, it works after setting
@code{modem-handshake} to @code{AT&K3}. @code{FAX_SEND_FLOW} (in
@file{policy.h}) can be anything that the host machine supports (because
the modem does both Xon/Xoff and RTS/CTS handshake simultaneously).

Unfortunately, a few problems remain:

-- faxing multi-page faxes to ZyXELs with ROM release 6.11a doesn't work
(fails on the receiving end with +FHNG:100 and on the sending side with
+FHNG:50).

-- faxing to some paper fax machines fails completely, for others, ``only''
complex graphics (like the Ghostscript-``tiger.ps'') fail. This one can be
partially cured by adding lots of padding zeroes into the fax data
(@code{g3cat -p 24}) - but that's unelegant, not complying to class 2
specs, and not supported (besides, it still doesn't work all the
time). Maybe later versions of @code{sendfax} will do the padding
automatically.

I recommend against using this modem with sendfax. In addition to the
technical problems, their customer support (at least, that of the german
distributor MVS) is basically non-existant. (I wrote them four times
describing my problems with the modem, and never got an answer).

@node Rockwell, Zoom-vfast, TelelinkIMS08, Modems
@subsection Rockwell-based modems, e.g. Supra

As far as I know, sending or receiving are no problem (although you have to
use 19200 baud when in class 2 faxmode - set @code{speed} to @code{19200}
in @file{sendfax.config}, and set @code{switchbd} to @code{19200} in
@file{mgetty.config}. Remember to change the modem initialization strings
to the proper values for your modem, that is, @var{ATQ0V1E0 OK AT&K3S0=0 OK}.

Especially for the @samp{SupraFax} modem, I've been told that you have to
set @code{modem-handshake} to @code{AT&K3} and initialize the modem with
@code{AT&S0&D2&K3}. Since the modem does not like being reset with DTR->low
(do @strong{not} use @code{&D3}!), an @code{ATZ} in the first
initizalization string in @file{mgetty.c}, to reset the modem into a known
state, is a good idea, too.

(Thanks to Christof Junge, chris@@cj.in-berlin.de, for trying out several
weeks until everything worked!)

Some other SupraFAX Rom releases seem to forget that they are set to use
RTS/CTS handshake if a @code{+FCLASS=0} is sent to them. I think it should
help to store the @code{AT&K3} into NVRAM, but maybe you have to patch
@file{mgetty.c}. See @file{contrib/readme.supra} for details.

Fax polling does not work because the Rockwell chipset does not support it.

@strong{NEWS:} Most recent Rockwell 33.600 modems do not support any
decent fax operation anymore -- they added ``simultaneous Voice over Data''
(SVD) to their modem firmware, and because the Eproms are not large
enough, they threw out their class 2 firmware.  Don't buy such a modem, 
it won't work properly with @code{mgetty+sendfax}.

If you buy a Rockwell-based modem (they are usually quite cheap), make
sure that you get one that can do class 2 or (better) class 2.0.  Even if
it's written on the box, some recent models just can't do it!

Together with @code{vgetty}, many Rockwell modems can distinguish between
different types of incoming ``RING'' tones (usually called ``distinguished
RING'' by the local Telco).  Use the command @code{AT#SDR=n} (n between 0
and 7) to enable this feature.  If in doubt, check with your modem
manual whether your modem can do this at all.

My own experience with my Zoom VFX 28.800 is also quite good, but it

Further, if your model toggles DCD betwen fax pages (@code{sendfax} fails

Note: If your modem doesn't properly distinguish incoming fax from data

@subsection German Telekom approved GVC modems

(GM-144VBIS+  RC9696/14 (?))

This modem does @emph{not(!)} use Xon/Xoff flow control. Further, the default
modem profile sets @samp{&S1}, which makes the modem disable DSR all the

So, #define @code{FAX_MODEM_HANDSHAKE "AT\\Q3&S0"} in @file{policy.h}, do not
define @code{FLOW_SOFT} for flow control, and fax sending should work. (It
does for me!)  Changing @code{FAX_SEND_BAUD} to @code{B19200} is not
necessary, it works with @code{B38400}.

Fax receiving... I did not fully test it. It's somewhat difficult since
that modem insists on using auto-answer, but it should be possible to let
it auto-answer if you set mgetty's ring counter high enough. Or, you can
trick the modem, by changing mgetty's answer command (@code{ATA}) into

@subsection MultiTech modems (MT1432BG and MT2834BG)

First of all, I want to thank MultiTech Munich for their support (borrowing
me two test modems w/o charge).

Second, I can only strongly recommend these modems, they are @strong{great}
(but expensive). Got it, unpacked it, switched it on, set mgetty's init
string (@code{MODEM_INIT}) to @code{ATS0=0&S1} -- and everything simply
worked. Flawlessly. (Warning: usually I recommend @code{AT&S0} to force the
DSR line high -- needed, because otherwise some O/Ses won't do hardware
flow control -- but that doesn't seem to work on my model. AT&S1 means that
H/W flow control only works when a carrier is present, but then, who needs
flow control in command mode?)

The modems do very reliably distinguish incoming fax and data calls, and
outgoing fax works also very good (unfortunately, it's limited to 9600 bps
fax rate, but that's no big problem).

The only problem I've seen is that those modem do the fax bit order on
reception @strong{right} (everybody else does it wrong, to be compatible
with Rockwell, who botched it in the first place). Thus, @code{g32pbm}
won't be able to decode the data, unless you call it as @code{g32pbm -r}.
(You can see if the bit order is wrong if g32pbm complains in every single
line). I'll work something out for one of the next releases to work around
this (@var{modem-quirks 02}).

BUT: There seems to be a way to tell the modem to behave like a Rockwell
one and use the "wrong" byte order. Carlos Fonseca found the following
text on ftp.multitech.com:

@example
Function          Command       Description

PROCESS           +FRBOR        Maintaining compatibility with
DATA IN                         Rockwell Class 2 chip set for fax data
DIRECT OR                       reception .
REVERSE ORDER                   FRBOR=0 - Process received fax data in
                                direct order.
                                FRBOR=1 - Process received fax data in
                                reverse order.
@end example

so, with AT+FRBOR=1 added to the modem initialization string, it should be
possible to get fax reception on the MultiTechs going without tricks.

Glenn Thobe suggested the following definitions for @file{policy.h} (which
mostly are factory defaults anyway, but it wouldn't harm to set them)

@example
#define MODEM_INIT_STRING	"ATS0=0Q0&D3&E1&E4&E13&E15"
#define FAX_MODEM_HANDSHAKE "AT&E4"
@end example

My @file{mgetty.config} for those modems looks like this (everything not
mentioned is set to the defaults I ship in @file{policy.h}).

@example
# MultiTech MT1432BG
port <whatever1>
  init-chat "" \d\d\d+++\d\d\dATE0E1V1H0 OK ATL0M0S0=0 OK

@end example

Some of the newer 56k-capable MultiTech modems have voice functionality,
but some firmware versions are very much broken.  Others seem to work more
or less.  So make sure you can return your modem to the dealer if it
doesn't work - and if the dealer isn't willing to do this, get a different
modem.  Russell King told me that the firmware version 0316D should be
working ok, but I got some negative reports as well. Hmmm.

voice support.  Older firmware releases had bugs in the voice area, but

here are a couple of notes for different products:

@itemize @bullet
@item MicroLink 56k/56k pro -- standard analogue voice/fax/data modem.
Pretty good for about everything, but make sure you use the latest firmware
version (1.58), as earlier versions have bugs switching between voice and
fax mode.
@item MicroLink Office -- in addition to being a nice modem, this thing can
do fax reception and answering machine functionality in "standalone mode",
without a computer.  Received voice calls and faxes can be downloaded via
X-Modem to the computer.  I'm working on a nice GUI application to ease
using the standalone mode.  The ML Office seems to be the only non-ISDN
ELSA modem that can do Caller ID (CLIP).
@item MicroLink TL/V.34 -- this is an ISDN terminal adaptor that can also
do V.34 modem calls and fax.  Works nicely.
@item TanGo -- this an ISDN only terminal adaptor.  Works, but it's pretty
boring stuff.
@item MicroLink 28.8/33.6 TQV -- this is the old voice/fax/modem series.
Works, but uses a different command to got to hardware flow control mode
(@code{AT\Q3} instead of @code{AT+IFC=2,2}) so you'll see some errors in
the voice log files.  Don't worry about that.

@subsection US Robotics (now 3com) Courier/Sportster Fax/Data modems

There are a number of major lines of 3com/US Robotics modems:

@itemize @bullet
@item USR Courier V.34/V.everything -- those are quite expensive, but 
really, really good modems.  I think those are the best V.34/X.2/V.90 
modems around, and they are also very good for class 2.0 faxing.   But 
make sure that you use a recent firmware, as older versions had very 
bad (and stooopid) bugs in the fax department.  You can find out the
firmware version with the @code{ATI7} modem command.  The 
@samp{Supervisor rev} version listed should be at least @samp{6.5.3}, 
better @samp{7.1.8} (this is the @samp{X.2 upgrade}).

Fax polling still doesn't work, and if you send faxes to a modem that can
only accept fax with 7200 bps, it will fail with @code{+FHS:25} unless you
specify @code{sendfax -M 7200}.

The Courier series does not have voice features.

@item USR I-Modem -- this is an ISDN Terminal Adaptor with built in
V.34/fax mode (``ISDN Modem'').  Nice product.  Works.  The same stuff
said for the Courier V.34/V.everything is true for the I-Modem.

@item older USR Courier modems -- older series without flash ROM, and
possibly not upgradable to V.34/X.2 at all, might give problems.  Fax was
added fairly late, and the first fax-capable releases are very buggy.  If
you have such a modem, and @code{ATI7} does not list @samp{V34} in the
@samp{Options} line, you might try the FAX_USRobotics option in
@file{policy.h}.  Maybe it helps.  But don't expect too much.

@item USR Sportster series -- the ``Sportster'' is actually a range of
many different low-end modems.  Most of them can do voice stuff, some of
them have flash ROM to be upgraded to newer firmware.  For data, this
modem is quite good.  For fax, it might work, and it might not -- I have
received a very high number of ``it doesn't work at all'' reports, and
also a number of ``it works very well for me'' reports.  If you plan to
buy one, make sure you can return it if it doesn't work.  (See below for
some specific issues and workarounds).

@item Internal PC card -- I haven't been able to find out yet whether that
is a ``Sportster'' or a ``Courier'', but it seems to be a Sportster, with
all its negative habits.
@end itemize

Some older USR firmware versions had severe bugs when doing RTS/CTS (that 
is, hardware) flow control. Occasionally, a byte got lost, and sometimes 
this confuses the modem enough to abort transmission with the error message
@example
Transmission error: +FHNG:44 (Unrecognized Transparent data command)
@end example
Sam Leffler recommends using Xon/Xoff flow control for both fax sending and
fax receiving (@code{#define FAX_SEND_FLOW FLOW_SOFT} and @code{#define
FAX_REC_FLOW FLOW_SOFT} in @file{policy.h}).

Some day in the future, I'll make those "quirks" configurable from the
config file, but until then, you'll have to live with recompiling. Sorry.
(Upgrade your firmware!).

Fax polling with the USRs is @emph{not} working, even though the modem
claims so. It will work half-way through, but fail miserably later.


When sending faxes with an USR faxmodem, set @code{ignore-carrier yes} in
@file{sendfax.config}.  Otherwise it will fail after the first page with a
read error and error code -5.  (But that is default anyway, if you use
mgetty 1.1.16 and up).

For some fax receivers, a problem remains: the USR modems do not want
to negotiate 7200 bps transmission speed.  If the receiving modem won't 
accept 9600 bps, transmission will fail after sending three DCS frames,
with the error code +FHS:25.  In that case, try setting 
@code{fax-max-speed 7200} in @file{sendfax.config}.

@code{RSPEC errors}: some series of USR Sportsters and early Couriers 
have bugs in the handling of the @code{AT+FCC} command.  It's meant to specify
the maximum transmission speed, like ``14400'', but these modems interpret
it as @strong{minimum} speed, so they fail if sending to a machine that
can only do 9600 bps.  If you see RSPEC errors in the sendfax log (+FHS:24), 
try the setting @code{modem-quirks 0x20} in @file{sendfax.config}.  This
will tell @code{sendfax} not to set the corresponding @code{AT+FCC} parameter.


The USR modems support Caller ID delivery (both the I-Modem series and the
analog ones).  Switch it on with @code{AT#CID=1} and mgetty should
automatically be able to recognize the incoming caller ID.  If not, show
me a detailed log file...

Firmware upgrades and documentation are available on @code{ftp.usr.de}

@subsection Elink ISDN Terminal Adaptors 293, 310, 393 with X.75 and V.110

The TA's are connected to national German ISDN (1TR6) or Euro-ISDN. The
host side is a standard serial port with an AT-command set, letting them
look like a conventional modem. Therefore they are often (wrongly) called
'ISDN modems'.

It is strongly recommended to feed them with 115k2 bps, else only V.110
(38k4 bps) is available. Configuration may differ slightly, depending on
which of those Elinks is used, wether it is connected to Euro-ISDN or 1TR6
and last but not least they are still under developement, so you're on your
own with that.

ISDN generally supports two nice features: first it is now possible to
check callers number, which may be used to identify callers, second ist
the charge service, where it is possible to request the amount of charge
units for the call. For mgetty the second one is only from minor interest,
but the first one is.  The opposite phone number will be shown with the
command @code{AT\O}. If a call comes in, @code{AT\OA} will answer the
call, display caller's id in a 'digit only' (e.g. @samp{04419808550}) form
and then print out the @code{CONNECT}-String.

To enable mgetty to utilize this, the "get caller ID" sequence must be set
up accordingly and the @samp{CND} feature must be enabled:

Use @code{get-cnd-chat "" AT\\O OK} in @file{mgetty.config}, and make
sure that @code{#define CNDFILE "@dots{}/dialin.config"} at the 
end of @file{policy.h} is enabled.  

If you only want to grab the phone
number and not check it against @file{dialin.config}, you can try playing
with something like  @code{answer-chat "" AT\\OA CONNECT \c \r} 
in @file{mgetty.config}.

Having a glance at the output of @code{AT I4}-output of the Elink, it looks
as if it is able to support Fax-Service too, but there is no hint in the
manual. So mgetty will likely put itself into data-only mode. (I got some
information from the Elink people that some of the Elinks have a data/fax
analog modem built in, which should work nicely with the fax part of
@code{mgetty}, but I didn't try yet.)

calls).

As far as I can see, i4l will always signal the caller ID for incoming
calls as "CALLER NUMBER: ..." to mgetty.  Mgetty can handle this
just fine.

If you want to see the destination number for incoming calls, add
@code{ATS23.2=1} to the @code{init-chat}.  This will make i4l signal
the dialed MSN number as @code{CALLED NUMBER: 12345}, and mgetty will 
then pass it on as $CALLED_ID to fax scripts and so on.  This is
implemented since Linux 2.4.10, or in earlier Versions with Jan
Oberlaender's patch
(http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uslk/i4l-callednumber.tar.gz).
(@strong{NOTE}: This doesn't seem to work for at least Linux 2.4.20
as shipped by RedHat 8.0 - anyone with some details??!)

Alternatively, you can set @code{ATS23.0=1}. This will make i4l signal
the dialed MSN number as @code{RING/12345}.  This was problematic in the
past, as lots of other modems have a similar format to report the Caller ID
(like @code{RING;4321} in ELSA modems) but recent mgetty versions handle 
this properly.  With this, you can run a single mgetty instance for all
your telephone numbers: just set @code{AT&L*} in your init string - this
tells isnd4linux that @strong{all} incoming calls are to be signalled
to mgetty, not only specific MSN.

@c init-chat "" ATZ OK AT&L* OK ATS23.0=1S23.2=1S0=0 OK
@c fax-only yes
@c rings 2
@c modem-quirks 1

For the full list of available AT commands, consult the i4l docs
(for example in @file{/usr/src/linux/Documentation/isdn/README}.

For ISDN PPP calls with synchronous PPP (which is the "normal" way to do
PPP over ISDN), you do @strong{not} need @code{mgetty}.  PPPoISDN calls
are handled by @code{ipppd}, which is part of isdn4linux.  Mgetty can
only handle PPP-over-X.75 or PPP-over-V110, which is something that is 
only used for WAP connections or with old terminal adaptors.

Fax support with isdn4linux is a tricky issue.  For most ISDN cards,
this will @strong{NOT WORK}.  It only works for cards that have a fax
chip (or separate CPU) on board, and can be accessed with the fax 
class 2/2.0 command set.  It will work fine with the Diehl Server BRI
ISDN card (active), and that's the only card I know that will work as of
June 2001.  Accessing ISDN fax via CAPI is NOT supported (see below).

There's a small catch: modem autodetection will make mgetty think that
your ttyI device doesn't support fax (because most cards can't do it).  So 
you need to set @code{modem-type cls} in @file{mgetty.config} and/or
@file{sendfax.config} to force class 2 mode.  Class 2.0 mode is not
supported.

Voice support with @code{vgetty} should work (use your ttyI device 
as an answering machine, etc.).  I have not tried it yet - talk to the
mgetty or i4l mailing lists if it doesn't work.

@node i4l-capi, Class 1, i4l, Modems
@subsection ISDN 4 Linux with CAPI

Some of the ISDN card manufacturers have pushed to adapt the windows 
Common ISDN API (CAPI) to Linux.  This in itself is not bad, but it has a
nasty side effect: less energy is invested to provide a useful Fax Class 2
support for the active ISDN cards that can do fax.  Some cards don't have
Fax Class 2 at all, and for some cards the Class 2 support is quite
broken.

So you might end up with a nice fax-capable card and no ttyI / Fax Class 2 
support for it...

@code{mgetty+sendfax} will, as of 1.1.31, @strong{NOT} work with a CAPI
interface.  

One of the problems with CAPI is that it is the wrong sort of 
abstraction for the purpose of sending a fax.  The call setup part
(dialing up) needs far too much attention for ISDN protocol details, and
the actual fax transmission part is far too automated - the CAPI doesn't
provide proper feedback about what's going on in the fax layer, like ``the
client requested a retransmission of page 2, and the connection was lost
in the middle of page 4'' - all you get is ``success/failure'' and the
number of pages transmitted (including retransmissions -- which makes this
figure less than useful).

If you need to use fax with CAPI, take a look at the ``capifax'' software 
available on @file{ftp://ftp.isdn4linux.de/pub/capi4linux} (not written
by me, but it works).  The stuff works with a CAPI-specific file format 
called ``SFF''.  

Conversion to SFF can be done with recent ghostscripts (cfax driver), 
and conversion from SFF to G3 can be done with the @code{sff2g3} program 
which comes with mgetty.  (I needed something like this for a customer 
project, and the existing SFF-to-something converters were all much to 
heavyweight - requiring tons of additional libraries, C++ converters, 
and whatnot.  My sff2g3 is 330 lines of code, needs no external libraries 
and only an ANSI C compiler.  Beat that :-) ).

Chances are good that I will eventually hack @code{capifax} into something 
that's call-compatible to @code{mgetty} (for fax reception) and
@code{sendfax} (for fax sending).  But this depends somewhat on customer
demand, read: paid-for time.

These do not work. They are not going to be supported (class 1 faxing is

If your system is not in the list, that doesn't mean it won't work. It
just means that I didn't get a report (or a port) for that system yet.

mgetty+sendfax should work on most unixoid operating systems, as long as
they provide @code{SysV termio} or @code{POSIX termios} call for tty
management. @code{BSD sgtty} support isn't finished yet.

For best results, your system should have @code{select(S)} or
@code{poll(S)}, but if both functions are not available or don't work on
ttys (@code{poll(S)} is known to do this on SVR3.1 and earlier), you can
use a kludge, @code{-DUSE_READ}.

Besides that, you'll need some fiddling with the header files to get all
defines and prototypes right.

Further, you'll have to check @file{tio.c}, function
@code{tio_set_flow_control()}, whether the way hardware flow control is
activated works on your system. Most likely, it won't --- that's one of the
major portability problems. If you change something and get it to work,
please send me patches. (You're welcome to do so anyway).

@node OS-Generic, SCO-322, Systems, Systems
@subsection Generic problems and common mistakes

There are a few things that can go wrong on all supported operating
systems. This section is meant to give a few hints how to find them.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mgetty} is correctly set up in @file{/etc/inittab}, but @code{ps}
doesn't list @code{mgetty} anyway.

This is usually caused by not notifying the @code{init} of your changes to
@file{/etc/inittab} (or @file{/etc/ttytab} on BSD). You have to signal
@code{init} with a HUP signal (@code{kill -1 1}) that it should re-read this
file.

@item
@code{mgetty} is setup correctly, runs a while, then stops being listed by
@code{ps}, and @code{init} complains something like @samp{respawning to
fast, disabling @dots{}}.

This means, there is an error in the mgetty set up. If the @code{mgetty}
process quits too fast (because of an error), and too often in a row,
@code{init} will assume that something is going crazy, and disable the
process. You can re-enable it with @code{kill -1 1}, but you should check
the mgetty log file (!!!!!) before, to find out @strong{why} it failed in
the first place
@end itemize


@node SCO-322, SCO-324, OS-Generic, Systems
@subsection SCO Unix 3.2.2 (ODT 1.0 / 1.1)

No major twiddling needs to be done. If your @code{select()} refuses to
sleep less than one second, use poll(S) instead (set @code{-DUSE_POLL} in
the CFLAGS section of @file{Makefile}).

Use the modem-control devices for mgetty and dial-outs (e.g.
@file{/dev/tty2A}), or (far better), use FAS with minor number of 80+port,
using full RTS + CTS handshake, and non-blocking opens (@file{/dev/ttyF01})
- the original SCO serial driver is slow, unreliable and doesn't do proper
hardware flow control. @xref{SCO-324}.

Ignore all the warnings about ``passing arg 2 of signal from
incompatible pointer type''. They are caused because the SCO 3.2.2
development system header files are somewhat unusual.

If it doesn't work, or some weird things happen on login (e.g., zmodem
downloads do not work), try compiling with -DSYSV_TERMIO. I had some
problems with Posix termios on SCO ODT 1.0.

@node SCO-324, Linux, SCO-322, Systems
@subsection SCO Unix 3.2.4 (ODT 2.0 and ODT 3.0)

I'm using mgetty on SCO 3.2v4(.2) (in fact, developing it there), so be
assured: it works.

I consider the way that hardware flow control is handled on SCO to be
broken, so I @emph{strongly} recommend using the @code{FAS} serial driver
(version 2.11 or higher, earlier versions may crash the system), to be
found on your nearest comp.sources.unix archive. With @code{fas}, use the
devices with a minor number of @samp{80+port number} for best results. Make
sure that your modem enables the @samp{DSR} line, because otherwise,
@code{FAS} won't do hardware handshake.

If you don't use @code{fas}, I've been told that you have to use the
@samp{modem control} lines, that is, the ``uppercase'' lines, e.g.
@file{/dev/tty1A}, because SCO's serial driver won't do any hardware flow
control at all on the ``lowercase'' lines. Be warned, the driver will also
disable hardware flow control if you use Xon/Xoff flow control (no way to
use both). Since I do not have a SCO system without @code{fas}, I'd like to
hear very much about results on one.

Also, you've to define @code{LOCKS_LOWERCASE}, since that's the convention
on SCO Unix and most other programs expect it.

If mgetty works only partially, but hangs the moment @file{/etc/issue}
is printed, before the `system!login:' prompt is output, you may have to
change the following line of @file{mgetty.c} (around line 780):

@example
        /* honor carrier now: terminate if modem hangs up prematurely
         */
        tio_carrier( &tio, TRUE );
@end example

to:

@example
        tio_carrier( &tio, FALSE );
@end example

But before you do this, make sure that your modem enables the CD line
while a carrier is present (Hayes modems: @samp{AT&C1}) and also enables
the DSR line (otherwise the port will block once @code{CLOCAL} is
removed).

This could have been a problem specific to Uwe's dumb AST-compatible
fourport card, but I do not think so.


Compilation issues:

Ignore warnings about @samp{struct utimbuf} and @samp{struct timeb}, they
are caused by improper include files. On SCO 3.2v4.2, ignore the warnings
about the getopt() prototype, or change prototype or include files.


Installation:

SCO provides two utilities to manipulate @file{/etc/inittab},
@code{enable} and @code{disable}. Those tools work only if you have
specified a gettydefs tag on the @code{mgetty} command line, otherwise
they will complain about ``not a valid tty''. So, either append the
gettydefs tag (@code{mgetty} will ignore it if not compiled with
@code{USE_GETTYDEFS}) or change @file{/etc/inittab} manually.

@node Linux, ISC, SCO-324, Systems
@subsection Linux


In current stable kernels (i.e. the latest 2.0.xx release or even
one of the 1.2.xx series) and current shared libraries (libc version
5.x) there should be no bug to interfere with this software.

If you have a really old Linux system, notice that Linux kernel
versions prior to 0.99pl15 have a bug in the serial handshake code,
that is, if the `CRTSCTS' flag is set, software flow control (XON/XOFF)
won't work. The alarm() call is broken in 4.1 and 4.4.2 libraries,
which sometimes results in aborting the fax receiving.

On very recent systems using the GNU Libc, you @strong{must} use 
mgetty 1.1.10 or higher, as the timeout handling on all previous 
versions doesn't work under glibc.  Unfortunately, this means that 
the version of mgetty shipped with RedHat 5.0 (1.1.9) won't work. Upgrade!

Hardware handshake (RTS+CTS) on Linux works flawlessly (but only if mgetty
is compiled with POSIX_TERMIOS, but that is default on Linux
anyway). Nevertheless, the @code{scrts.c} program in @file{contrib/} is
still provided, it has some other uses, too.

Linux has no poll(S), so, don't #define @code{USE_POLL}, and the default,
@code{USE_SELECT}, will be used.

@strong{Important note:} Use the @file{/dev/ttyS*} devices for getty and
for dial-out (that is, for kermit, uucico, cu, seyon, ...) - @strong{never}
use @file{/dev/cua*}. Dialing out on @file{/dev/cua*} will result in the
error message ``device busy''. (There are reasons why @code{mgetty} cannot
use the ``@file{ttyS*} vs. @file{cua*} kernel locking mechanism'', see
below). If @strong{all} programs agree on using @file{/dev/cua*} only,
it will work, too - but they have to agree on one variant.

For some background about @file{ttyS} vs. @file{cua}, you might want
to read a mail from the author of the Linux serial drivers, Ted Ts'o,
posted to the Linux-PPP mailing list. I have included it in 
@file{doc/ttyS-cua.txt}.

Some guys seemingly can't resist posting misinformation to the net all the
time, don't believe 'em. The @file{/dev/cua*} devices are @strong{not}
different from the @file{/dev/ttyS*} devices concerning data flow or modem
control lines. The only difference is how the device reacts if you do an
@code{open()}: Opening @file{/dev/ttyS*} normally blocks until the ``carrier
detect'' line goes active (unless @code{open()} is called with the
@code{O_NDELAY} flag; @code{mgetty} and all dial-out programs do that), and
opening @file{/dev/cua*} will return an error message (@code{errno=EBUSY})
if another process has the device already open, thus @emph{preventing
dial-out on @file{/dev/cua*}} if @code{mgetty} is active on
@file{/dev/ttyS*}.

We use @file{/dev/ttyS*} all the time for dial-in @emph{and} for dial-out,
and believe me, it works, and it's the @emph{only} combination that will
work properly. The kernel locking mechanism only works if you use modem
auto-answer (the getty process sleeps until the modem gets a carrier), and
mgetty uses manual answer (it waits for the RING message from the modem),
which will save your callers a lot of grief because their calls will
only be answered if your computer is ready to receive a call. Part of the
motivation for writing mgetty was being tired of losing lots of money
for useless calls to a hung machine.

I'd recommend against using @file{/dev/modem} as a link to the real
device, but if you do that, make it a @strong{hard link} to the
appropriate @file{/dev/ttyS*}. A soft link will cause problems with the
device ownership because of a peculiarity in the linux @code{chown()}
implementation (that I refuse to work around).

If you get into trouble with write permissions on ttySx, you may add
a new group @samp{dialout} to @file{/etc/group}, then 
@code{chown .dialout /dev/ttySx} your device, and add your users to 
the dialout group. Don't forget to add the system user @samp{uucp} to 
that group (UUCP needs to have modem access), and make sure,
@code{port-group} in mgetty's configuration file is set up correctly.
The concept of such a dialout group is already used in most Linux 
distributions today.

There are various different @code{init} and @code{last} programs out there,
some work with mgetty, some don't. If you get some strange output from
@code{who} or @code{last} and are using a different @code{init} program
than the @code{sysv init}, try to define @code{-DNO_SYSVINIT}. That should
help.

I've been told that it's necessary to do that if you use the
@code{simple-init}.

Anyway, I can only @strong{strongly} recommend to switch over to
@code{SysVinit} if you use @code{simple init}, since the latter seems to
be severely broken regarding utmp and controlling tty handling.

If you have problems because of an uninitialized @code{TERM} environment
variable (which really isn't getty's job, but @code{getty_ps} insists on
doing it, and people rely on it), use the @code{term @dots{}} config file
option to set it according to your needs.

If you're experiencing problems with hanging @code{/bin/login} processes,
@xref{login-hang}.

Recently, I have received a number of bug reports concerning operation in
systems using one or more @strong{Cyclades serial boards}.  There is some
incompatibility between the standard Cyclades driver and the GNU CC
2.7.2, which can result in system lockups.  Upgrade to the very latest
Linux driver, which can be found on ftp.cyclades.com.  I have received
reports that the driver version 2.1 works fine (85 modems on one system,
connected to 3 Cyclom Ye boards!).

@node ISC, SVR4, Linux, Systems
@subsection ISC

The ISC port has been done by Russell Brown, russell@@lutton.lls.com. Thanks!

First of all, define @code{-DISC} in the Makefile. This will take care
of some minor problems. Then, link with @code{-linet -lpt}.

If you have a ISC Unix 4.0, you may have to define @code{-D_POSIX_SOURCE}
to get around some include file problems and link @code{-lcposix}.

If you have problems with the AWK programs in the @file{fax/} shell
scripts, try defining @code{AWK=nawk} in the @file{Makefile}. That should
take care of those problems.

Again, for best results I recommend using the FAS serial driver, and
using a port with a minor number of 80+portno (ttyF01 etc.)

If you use a Digiboard smart serial cart (e.g. the digiboard pc/8e), use
the @file{/dev/ttyi*} devices instead of @file{/dev/cui*}, becaus only the
former ones honour carrier drops (If you use @file{cui*}, your processes
won't die if the modem unexpectedly hangs up)


@node SVR4, SVR42, ISC, Systems
@subsection SVR4 Unix

mgetty has been ported to SVR4 now (many thanks to Bodo Bauer,
<bodo@@hal.nbg.sub.org>, Martin Husemann, <martin@@bi-link.owl.de> and Marc
Boucher <marc@@cam.org>).

As far as I know, it's sufficient to add @samp{-DSVR4} to the CFLAGS in
Makefile. If you have any problems or suggestions, please report them also
to the people above, since I do not have a SVR4-System to run tests on.

If you use the @code{SAS} serial driver (streams-version of @code{FAS}) and
want to force @code{sas} to use hardware-handshake all the time, use a
device with a minor device number of @code{80+port number} (see the
@code{sas} manual for explantations). If you use a port with a minor device
number of @code{7*16+i}, @code{mgetty} is able to switch hardware handshake
on and off according to the flags set in policy.h, using
@file{sys/termiox.h}. (Well, it works - but apparently fax reception
doesn't work with this minor device number. Symptom: only one byte is
received during fax reception (0x00). Anybody any clue?). 

If you use @code{FAS}, use the devices with a minor device number of
@code{80+port number} (as usual).

@node SVR42, BSD, SVR4, Systems
@subsection SVR4.2 - Onsite Unix, UnixWare, ...

Basically, SVR4.2 is quite similar to SVR4, but you have to watch out for
some details (defining @code{-DSVR42} in the Makefile will do it for you).

Most important, the @emph{termiox} interface via the @code{TCGETX} /
@code{TCSETX} @code{ioctl()}s does not seem to work any longer - the calls
return an error, and the port behaves strangely. If you're experiencing
this, please try commenting out the corresponding code in @file{tio.c},
funtion @code{tio_set_flow_control()} and mail me whether that make it
work.

Further, ussing @code{USE_POLL} or @code{USE_READ}, won't work. The default
of @code{USE_SELECT} is OK.

To enable hardware handshake, use the tty device with the trailing ``h'',
e.g.  @file{tty01h}. On the other one (@file{tty01}), the driver won't do
H/W handshake.

Depending on the configuration, parallel dial-out with Taylor-UUCP may fail
(uucico complaining that it cannot set @code{CLOCAL}), in that case, you've
to recompile Taylor with different settings for the @code{termio} selection
(POSIX vs. SYSV).

Many thanks to Joerg Weber (joerg@@interface-business.de) for finding all
those problems.

@c FAX_SEND_IGNORE_CARRIER --> UnixWare bug!

Ed Hall (edhall@@rand.org) found another major glitch on UnixWare 4.2: if
you run @code{sendfax} without setting
@code{ignore-carrier true} in @file{sendfax.config}, and @code{sendfax}
switches off carrier detection at the end of the very last page, the
kernel code messes up something and bytes get lost. The modem then returns 
funny error codes, like, for example,
@example
Transmission error: +FHNG:44 (Unrecognized Transparent data command)
@end example
If you're experiencing this, just set @code{ignore-carrier true}
and everything should work just fine (please tell me in any case whether
it was necessary, because if it happens for other people as well, I'll
make this permanent on SVR42).

@xref{Solaris2}.

@node BSD, AIX, SVR42, Systems
@subsection BSD-like flavours of Unix

A port to 386BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD has been done by Martin Husemann,
martin@@bi-link.owl.de, and Gunther Shadow, gusw@@fub46.zedat.fu-berlin.de.

I think it works quite well, except that the @code{VTIME} mechanism to
timeout @code{read()} calls doesn't work in older *BSD versions. If
@code{mgetty} hangs, with the last line in the log file being something
like ``waiting for line to clear'', upgrade your kernel, or, if you can't
do that, compile @code{mgetty} with @code{-DBROKEN_VTIME} (in that case,
select() will be used).

For older versions of BSD Unix that do not have @file{termios.h}, you'll
have to complete the unfinished support for @file{sgtty.h} in @file{tio.c}
and @file{tio.h}.

Generally, BSD Unices do not have a @file{/etc/inittab} as system V has.
Instead, they have @file{/etc/ttys} (or sometimes @file{/etc/ttytab} on
really old BSD systems). Thus, you have to enter a line like
@example
cua0    "@SBINDIR@/mgetty -x 3 cua0"       vt100
@end example
or
@example
cua00	"@SBINDIR@/mgetty -x 3"    vt100 on insecure
@end example
there. See the corresponding manpage for an exect description of the files
format on your system. Don't forget to remove (or comment out) the
original getty on the corresponding @file{/dev/tty*} line.

@node AIX, SunOS, BSD, Systems
@subsection IBM's AIX Operating System

Chris Lewis, Harald Milz and Michael Staats have done excellent work on
porting @code{mgetty} to AIX.   Since then, I have taken over and actively 
use mgetty+sendfax on AIX for customer systems, and everything is very
well tested now.

On AIX, many people do not want to manipulate @file{/etc/inittab} directly,
instead,  use some system administration tools (like 'smit'). To ease
@code{mgetty} installation on AIX, Michael Staats has provided a small
shell script, @code{inittab.aix}, that will help you setup your
@file{inittab} after you've run @code{make install}. Just call it with the
name of the tty you're modem is connected to, e.g. 

@code{./inittab.aix tty0}.

I have received a couple of problem reports on AIX 4.1 where ``suddenly''
the modem line stopped working and all mgetty reported were error
messages. If that happens to you, set @code{toggle-dtr no} in
@file{mgetty.config}. AIX 4.1 doesn't seem to like programs that fiddle
with the modem control lines.

Christoph Brinck (cb@@medat.de) has also reported that it's
necessary to enable the ``dtropen line discipline'' for the serial line
you're using (whatever that may mean). This is done with the command:

@example
chdev -l 'tty1' -a flow_disp='rts'
chdev -l 'tty1' -a open_disp='dtropen'
@end example

or via the @samp{chgtty} part of @code{SMIT} (but I think that's the
default setting for new ttys anyway).

Hardware and Software flow control work fine on AIX 3.x and AIX 4.x now.

@node SunOS, Solaris2, AIX, Systems
@subsection SunOS 4.1.1 and up

mgetty has been ported to SunOS, and seems to work quite well.  If you use
SunOS, please send me a brief report about your results.

Thanks to Earl Hartwig, earl@@fozzi.ocunix.on.ca, for the initial port.

For compilation, please define @code{-Dsunos4}.

In @file{policy.h}, you've to adapt the location of the LOCK files.

In the Makefile, set @code{ECHO='...'} to
@code{/usr/5bin/echo}, because the standard one doesn't
support escape codes like @samp{\n} or @samp{\c}. Alternatively, if you
don't have the System5 options installed, use @code{mg.echo}.

If a fax reception hangs shortly after the @samp{+FCON} is seen, please try
setting @code{FAXREC_FLOW} to Xon/Xoff (@code{FLOW_SOFT}). Hardware
handshake has problems on SunOS versions without the ``Jumbo TTY'' patch.

If fax sending hangs mysteriously between the first and the second page,
you're likely to have a modem that drops DCD during pages. As SunOS'
serial drivers are dumb, reception of data will fail if DCD is low and
handshake is set to RTS/CTS. So, set @code{ignore-carrier yes} in
@file{sendfax.config} @strong{and} @code{#define FAXSEND_FLOW FLOW_SOFT} 
in @file{policy.h} and fax sending should work.

Please use the ``outgoing'' devices (@file{/dev/cua*}) for mgetty and
dial-outs, using the ``incoming'' devices (@file{/dev/tty*}) will make
dialout impossible. Further, carrier detect (DCD) is only honoured
on the @file{cua*} lines.

It is @strong{very} strongly recommended that you install the 
``jumbo tty patch'' (patch number 100513-05 for 4.1.2 or .3, patch 
number 101621-01 for 4.1.3_u1 and up) because it will fix a lot 
misbehaviour of the serial line drivers.

Please read also the generic BSD section.

@subsection Solaris 2.3 and up

mgetty runs successfully and without trouble under Solaris 2.3, 2.4 and
2.5.1 (later versions should also work, but I didn't get any report so far).
For compilation use @code{-Dsolaris2}. With Solaris 2.3 it's recommended to use
GNU gcc, but with Solaris 2.4 it compiles fine with the SPARCompiler C 3.0.1.
Define @code{CC=cc}.

In @file{policy.h} you have to define @samp{term/a} or @samp{term/b} as
@code{FAX_MODEM_TTYS}. Don't use the outgoing devices @samp{/dev/cua/*}!!

As @code{DEVICE_GROUP} you should configure @samp{uucp}.  If you want allow
to normal users to dial out, add all users allowed to do that, to the group
@samp{uucp}. Then it's important to change the permissions of
@file{/var/spool/locks} from the default permissions @samp{drwxr-xr-x} to
@samp{drwxrwsr-x}. Make sure that it's owned by @samp{uucp.uucp}.
Otherwise no one wanting to dial out is able to create a lock file.  The
@code{FILE_MODE} in @file{policy.h} must be @samp{0660} as well.

If you don't want allow anyone to dial out you should set @code{FILE_MODE}
to @samp{0640} or @samp{0600}.

For the "notify mail" message to look best, define @code{MAILER} in
@file{policy.h} to @var{/usr/lib/sendmail} and define
@code{NEED_MAIL_HEADERS}. So a proper subject header is created.
Nevertheless, @code{/usr/bin/mailx} works, as it is the default for SVR4.

If everything compiled well and you did @code{make install}, you have to
add an entry to @file{/etc/inittab} like the following:

@example
ya:234:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty -s 38400 -x 3 term/a
@end example

@emph{Don't use the Solaris @code{admintool} to create any port monitoring
entries in @file{/etc/saf/_sactab} and @file{/etc/saf/zsmon/_pmtab}.}

Many thanks to Stefan Muehlenweg (muehlenw@@samhh.hanse.DE) for this section.

Solaris (as all Sun operating systems) seems to be somewhat weird
concerning its handling of the RTS line.  I have received two reports that
'sometimes' a modem hangs during initialization, and won't talk to mgetty
anymore.  In these cases, the problem went away when the modem (an USR
Sportster) was set to @code{AT&R1}, which means 'ignore RTS line'.  Thanks
to Valerio Di Giampietro for detailing this.

@node 3b1, HP-UX, Solaris2, Systems
@subsection AT&T 3b1

Glenn Thobe and Chris Lewis have ported mgetty+sendfax to AT&T's 3B1
machines, it should compile without changes to the source (but define
-D_3B1_ in the Makefile).

These ports are to two different environments:

Glenn's port was with GCC (ANSI C) and an add-on select() library routines. 
Chris's port was with stock 3b1 C, without select().
Both seem reliable.

Some further hints concerning a select() library and the pbmplus tools can
be found in the file @file{contrib/3b1} which are the notes from Glenn's
port.

Chris's port relies simply on the suggested definitions (especially
@code{-DUSE_READ}) in the Makefile.  Chris suggests that you use select()
if you already have it for some other reason, but that it seems to work
just fine without it.

Right now, I think mgetty won't compile with the standard C compiler (it
will with gcc), because the stuff I do in the @file{conf_*.c} source files
is a little bit too hard for it. I'll work on it.

@node HP-UX,  NEXTSTEP, 3b1, Systems
@subsection The HP-UX operating system

@code{mgetty} runs on HP-UX, but that's very much all I can say about it (I
don't know anything about HPs, except that they are somewhat strange).

Currently, documentation for HP-UX is a bit lacking - if you know
something about @code{mgetty} on HP-UX, please contribute.

@node NEXTSTEP, Darwin, HP-UX, Systems
@subsection The NEXTSTEP operating system

NEXTSTEP is lacking quite a few commands used by mgetty and its
tools: Luckily, they are available from the GNU project
(please mail me if I forgot any),
e.g. gawk, cut (from textutils), id and logname (from sh-utils). All of
them can be compiled for NEXTSTEP without problems, and it's certainly
a good idea to install them anyway. ghostscript needs some fiddling for
NEXTSTEP, but it's available precompiled on the arcives as GSPrintFilter.
If you don't intend to use faxspool and friends, you may succeed without
installing the forementioned utilities.

Having said this, there are two different ways to compile @code{mgetty}
for NEXTSTEP, each with their pros and contras:

@itemize @bullet
@item
With termios interface: To use @code{mgetty}'s termios interface (the
default), you have to link against NEXTSTEP's buggy POSIX library.

In the Makefile, add "-posix -DBSD" to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

Drawbacks: The log file will be corrupted due to an append bug in libposix.

Use this only if you want to try vgetty. In all other cases it's probably
better to choose the second variant:

@item
With sgtty interface: Ben Stuyts @samp{benst@@stuyts.nl} has done an
effort to make a @code{mgetty} port using the BSD sgtty style interface
to the serial ports. This port doesn't need the POSIX library.

In the Makefile, add "-DNEXTSGTTY -DBSD".

This port has been tested with m68k and i386 machines.

For i386 machines, you may want to use the /bin/login replacement
@samp{modem-login} in @code{mgetty}'s contrib directory. NEXTSTEP's login
has problems with 8-bit logins. I've got one report from Ben Stuyts,
though, that @samp{modem-login} does fix problems on ``Black NeXT''s as
well. Just try it.

Drawback: You can't compile vgetty with sgtty support yet! If you want to use
vgetty with NEXTSTEP, you'll have to stick with the termios port. There are
problems with the LNOHANG bit not being acknowledged
correctly, therefore hanging the modem when the caller hangs up.
@end itemize

For i386 machines, it's wise to use the /dev/cudfX (hardware flow
control,...) devices. I'm using them with NeXT's most recent serial port
driver, Mark Salyzyn's Mux driver also supports them.

For m68k machines, you have to stick with /dev/cufa.

This are the settings I use in the Makefile:

@example
CC=cc
CFLAGS=-DNEXTSGTTY -DBSD -O2  (-posix -DBSD for termios port)
INSTALL=install -c -o root -g wheel
spool=/usr/spool
SBINDIR=$(prefix)/etc
ECHO="mg.echo"
INSTALL_MECHO=mg.echo
AWK=gawk
@end example

Furthermore, you should define binary lock files, in policy.h:

@example
#define LOCKS_BINARY 1
@end example

Finally, when using NEXTSTEP's cc, you need to run "make noident" in
the first place to remove the #ident directives from the source files.

If you have questions, comments or suggestions regarding @code{mgetty} with
NEXTSTEP, feel free to contact Gregor Hoffleit

@node Darwin, , NEXTSTEP, Systems
If I understand this correctly, "Darwin" is the underlying operating
system that Apple MacOS X is based upon.

Edwin C Wirth <ecwirth@@mac.com> gave me an account to his "Darwin Kernel
Version 5.1" machine (running MacOS 10.1.1 on top of it) so I could port 
@code{mgetty+sendfax} to that OS.  Thanks to that, Darwin is supported 
from 1.1.28 on.

Compilation is pretty straightforward: use the default CFLAGS and LIBS
settings in the Makefile, set @code{CC=cc}, and then run @code{make}.  It
will spit out a ton of warnings about @samp{undefined or invalid #
directive} - but those are harmless, it's just cpp not understanding
@code{#ident}.

At run time, as far as I could see, the internal Mac modem is available on
@file{/dev/tty.modem}.  The macintosh I had for testing also had "KeyUSA"
USB-to-Serial ports that appeared as @file{/dev/tty.KeyUSA28X913.1} and
@file{.2} - so other serial ports should also appear as @file{/dev/tty.*}
devices.  Note: there seem to be ''cu'' devices as well
(@file{/dev/cu.modem}), as in older Linux variants.  I did only try
sending faxes via @file{tty.modem} yet, but to resolve locking issues, 
it might be neccesary to use @file{cu.*} devices.  To be continued...

Mgetty should be run from @file{/etc/ttys} as in other BSDs, see 
@code{man ttys} (there is no @file{/etc/inittab}).

Open issues:
@itemize @bullet
@c @item how to access external serial ports?
@item is it better to use @file{/dev/cu.*} or @file{/dev/tty.*}?
@item how is tty locking done?  Couldn't find UUCP lock files
@item any tricky things about logging in remotely?  utmp/wtmp?
@item where should the log files go to?  /var/log doesn't seem to exist.

@subsection pbmtog3
The @code{pbmtog3} program from the @file{pbmplus} distribution produces G3
data that does not adhere to the T.4 standard. The initial EOL code is
missing, and the lines are not always 1728 pixels wide.  So, some fax
machines won't accept the output at all (not printing even one line), and
others will complain.

A fix for this problem is available: I have included a patch for pbmtog3,
called @file{patches/pbmtog3.p1}, that will fix the problems. (Oh, by the
way, if you try to send a fax generated with an unpatched pbmtog3, sendfax
will complain that it doesn't like the file @dots{} I've added a small
sanity check to spare me the time browsing through the logfiles guessing
@emph{why} sendfax failed (won't work if the file has been processed by
@code{g3cat}, though!)). If you use the @code{pbm2g3} program that is
shipped with @code{mgetty}, there is @strong{no need to patch anything}.

Basically, there is no need at all to use @file{pbmplus}' @code{pbmtog3}
program any more, since @code{mgetty} includes an own copy. I just wanted
to warn you.

Anyway, my program is lots faster @dots{}.

@node Locks, login-hang, pbmtog3, General
@subsection Lock files
Kermit et.al. cannot dial out while mgetty is running (modem responses
are eaten by mgetty)---what's wrong?

Most propably, you have not configured the @code{LOCK} and
@code{LOCKS_BINARY} defines in @file{policy.h} properly. Make sure that
the lockfiles kermit (or cu, pcomm, seyon,@dots{}) expect are in the
path specified in @code{LOCK} and set @code{LOCKS_BINARY} to 1 if they do
not write the PID of the locking process in ascii (10 bytes) to the lock
file but as a 4-byte integer instead. Mgetty and Sendfax will understand
both types of lock files, but if @code{LOCKS_BINARY} is not set properly,
other programs may not understand the lock file.

Also, make sure that both processes use the same name for the device.
(i.e., mgetty locking @file{/dev/ttyS0} and kermit locking
@file{/dev/modem} will definitely fail.)

@node login-hang, ecu, Locks, General
@subsection mgetty works, /bin/login hangs

A problem seen fairly often on directly connected serial lines
(@code{mgetty -r}), and seldomly on modem lines, is that @code{mgetty}
works flawlessly, but @code{/bin/login} just hangs instead of prompting for
the user password.

The reason for this is that many @code{login} programs reopen
@file{/dev/tty} (the controlling tty of a process) to make sure they have
full control over the password entered by the user (for example, to prevent
snooping). This will block on some systems if the DCD (carrier detect) line
coming from the modem or the other machine is low. Notably those systems
are those that have callin/callout device pairs for one serial device, e.g.
Linux, SunOS, SCO/FAS, etc.

The fix is easy: make sure that the DCD line is high. 

If you use a modem, the command to do this is usually @code{AT&C1} (but
check with your modem manual). 

If you're using a direct null-modem connection to another host, the
recommended solution is to wire DCD on your side to the DTR line on the
other side and vice versa. That way, when the remote machine ``hangs up''
(calling program exits and DTR drops), your host will get notified as
well. This is what a properly wired (!) ``null-modem cable'' does anyway.

If you don't have free lines in your serial cable (classic three-wire
approach), wire DCD to the DTR line on your own host, and make sure that
mgetty won't toggle DTR upon startup (causing a hangup signal!), e.g. by
setting @code{toggle-dtr no} in @file{mgetty.config}.

@node ecu,  , login-hang, General
@subsection ECU 3.20 or earlier on SCO collides with mgetty

ECU releases 3.20 and earlier had a severe bug in the utmp handling that
prevented dialing out on a port that mgetty uses. It has been fixed in ECU
3.27. If you run into that problem, please get a newer release.
Alternatively, you can use the patch that Uwe Fuerst provided, it can be
found in @file{patches/ecu320.p1}.

@node logfiles, ftp, General, Problems
@section Sample Log files

Both mgetty and sendfax can provide logfiles that can be very helpful for
debugging and accounting purposes. The amount that is logged is controlled
with the default set in @file{policy.h} and the command line argument
@code{-x <level>}. Higher numbers give more details.

At this place, I want to show you some typical cases, so you can compare
your log files to those given here and check what is different.

(Note: naturally all the modem initializations, and also some of the modem
responses, vary between modem brands!)

All the mgetty log files have been done with log level @code{L_MESG}, that is,
@code{-x 4}. The sendfax log file was done with @code{L_NOISE}, @code{-x 5}.

@subsection mgetty, logging into syslog

If your system has a @code{syslogd} and the @code{syslog()} C function,
mgetty can send parts of its log files to the @file{syslog} (For details,
see comments in @file{policy.h}). Not all the information from the log file
is logged here (to avoid clobbering the syslog), just errors and so-called
"audit" messages (seen in the log file as lines with "####" at the
beginning). These have a fixed format, and could easily be parsed by a
program. Let me list a few, and then comment them.

@example
Mar  3 18:36:16 greenie mgetty[673]: failed A_FAIL dev=tty4d, pid=673, caller=none, conn='', name=''
Mar  3 18:41:56 greenie mgetty[1866]: fax dev=tty4d, pid=1866, caller=none, name='', id='49 89 3243328        ', +FHNG=100, pages=1, time=00:00:29 
Mar  3 21:46:56 greenie mgetty[4807]: fax dev=tty4d, pid=4807, caller=none, name='', id='+31 20 6147110       ', +FHNG=000, pages=1, time=00:00:33 
Mar  3 20:45:59 greenie mgetty[4038]: data dev=tty4d, pid=4038, caller=none, conn='38400/V.32  9600/MNP5', name='', cmd='/bin/login', user='mbox'
Mar  3 22:41:43 greenie mgetty[6470]: data dev=tty4c, pid=6470, caller=none, conn='38400/ZyX  16800/V42b', name='', cmd='/usr/lib/uucp/uucico', user='Uartinet'
@end example

Those five lines are one failed call, two fax calls, one of them failed and
one successful, and two data calls, one of a human caller, loggin into the
BBS system, and one of a calling uucico.

It looks very confusing until you understand the system behind it. The
first fields specify date and time, originating host (greenie is my
machine) and program (mgetty). The next field specifies the type of the
connection made: @samp{fax}, @samp{data} or @samp{failed} - the latter one
usually means failure to initialize the modem or failure to connect to a
calling modem, resulting in the well-known @samp{NO CARRIER} message...

The @samp{dev} and @samp{pid} fields specify the line and process ID of the
mgetty process writing that line.

The @samp{caller} and @samp{name} fields give caller ID information - if
none is available (as it is here in Germany), or if your modem doesn't
handle it, it will list @samp{none} and @samp{''}, respectively.

For fax calls, additional informations given are the remote station ID
(@samp{id='@dots{}'}), the hangup code (@samp{+FHNG=@dots{}}, 0 means "ok"),
the number of pages and the connection time.

For data calls, the string that the modem returned after @samp{CONNECT} is
listed as @samp{conn='@dots{}'}. The string that was entered at the login
prompt is listed as @samp{user='@dots{}'}, and the program that is called
to do the login is given as @samp{cmd='@dots{}'}. Usually this will be
@code{@LOGIN@} unless you have some special system setup for fido or
uucp callers - as I have here, as you can see above.

@section How to get the mentioned software by FTP?

Most of the software mentioned in this document should be available on most
major ftp sites. Nevertheless, I've got so many questions about the
software that I'll list some ftp sites here.

Furthermore, I'll list some other software that may be interesting if you
plan to use @code{mgetty+sendfax} in different environments than I do.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mgetty+sendfax}

The current release can usually be found at:

sunsite.unc.edu:@file{/pub/Linux/system/serial/getty/mgetty+sendfax*}

tsx-11.mit.edu:@file{/pub/linux/sources/sbin/mgetty+sendfax*}

alpha.greenie.net:@file{/pub/mgetty/source/*}

ftp.leo.org:@file{/pub/comp/os/unix/networking/mgetty/*}

ftp.mathematik.th-darmstadt.de:@file{/pub/linux/mirrors/misc/mgetty/*}

linux.nrao.edu:@file{/pub/src/mgetty/*}

ftp.chem.tue.nl:@file{/pub/mgetty/*}

http://linux.mit-lab.co.kr/mgetty/*

ftp.uvt.ro:@file{/pub/mgetty/*}

... and on all sites that mirror SunSITE.unc.edu or tsx-11.

The most recent beta release is always placed in the listed directories
on alpha.greenie.net, ftp.leo.org and their mirrors on th-darmstadt.de 
and linux.nrao.edu.  

On SunSITE and TSX-11, you'll only find ``stable'' releases (even 
version numbers, no date stamp in the file name).

Use betas on your own risk!

@item
@code{pbmplus}

I found the pbmplus package (bitmap manipulation tools) at the following
places (most other sites mirroring X11 should also have them):

src.doc.ic.ak.uk:@file{/computing/graphics/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z}

wuarchive.wustl.edu:@file{/packages/X11R5/contrib-pub/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z}

ftp.germany.eu.net:@file{/X11/contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z}

ftp.leo.org:@file{/pub/comp/os/unix/networking/mgetty/}

The @code{pbmplus} package has been superceded by the @code{NetPBM}
package which has some more conversion tools (but also some more bugs). It
should be available on the same sites. You could also check:

wuarchive.wstl.edu:@file{/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM}

ftp.rahul.net:@file{/pub/davidsen/source}

ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de:@file{/???}

The @code{pbmtodot} program mentioned in the ``fax'' chapter can be found,
if nowhere else, in the @file{mgetty} directory on ftp.leo.org (see above).

@item
@code{FAS}

Some sites carrying the @code{fas} serial driver for SCO Unix, ISC, @dots{}:

ftp.fu-berlin.de:@file{/pub/unix/driver/fas/fas-2.11.tar.gz}

ftp.germany.eu.net:@file{/pub/newsarchive/comp.sources.unix/volume27/fas-2.11.0/*}

src.doc.ic.ac.uk:@file{/usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume27/fas-2.11.0/*}

As far as I know, the current version is 2.12, but you should find 2.12 at
the same places as 2.11. I never upgraded, 2.11 works very fine for me :)

@item
@code{GhostScript}

The GNU GhostScript postscript interpreter can be found at all sites
carrying GNU Software. The ``main'' GNU site is @emph{prep.ai.mit.edu}.

The new version 3.x isn't GNU software anymore, but uses a special
license. You can find it in @file{/pub/ghost/aladdin} on
@emph{ftp.cs.wisc.edu}, and on various other mirror sites (e.g. ftp.leo.org).

@item
@code{hp2pbm}

GhostScript is huge and slow... if you don't need it for other purposes,
you could use Chris Lewis' hp2pbm package, placed at

ftp.leo.org as @file{hp2pbm*} (in the mgetty directory mentioned above).

This package contains all you need to convert ASCII or LJ PCL4 -> PBM, G3,
PS, X windows, Epson 24 pin. Coupled with mgetty's @code{g32pbm}, it's all
you need to send ASCII or HP LJ via FAX, and display/print FAXes on X, PS,
LJ, Epson, or via PBM utilities

It performs better than most of the equivalent PBMPLUS utilities.  Indeed,
if your application can generate both LJ and PS, generating LJ and
converting to G3 via @code{hp2pbm} is *much* faster than generating PS and
converting via GhostScript.

[Citing Chris: Incidentally, "g32pbm" plus my "pbm2lj" is much faster
than g3tolj.  Am not entirely sure why yet.  May have something to do
with scaling, which g32pbm and pbm2lj don't do.]

@item
@code{psroff}

ftp.uunet.ca:@file{/distrib/chris_lewis/psroff3.0pl17/*}

[Chris: It should be ...psroff/*, but they never answer when I ask them to
fix my symlink]

Contains all you need to generate PS, LJ, or ditroff from ditroff or CAT
troff or groff. Together with hp2pbm, you can generate FAXes.  Contains
quite a number of LJ fonts, font manipulation, and font scaling utilities.

With the last two tools, you can send, receive, and print FAXes using
_just_ mgetty and hp2pbm (and a Laserjet printer ;-), without needing
pbmplus or GhostScript or anything else.

@item
@code{Ifmail}

Ifmail is Eugene Crosser's FidoNet (tm) compatible mailer + gateway
software for Unix and Linux. Together with @code{mgetty}, it provides the
perfect modem solution, allowing incoming Fido calls as well as Unix-Login
and fax. It can be found on:

tsx-11.mit.edu:@file{/pub/linux/sources/usr.bin/ifmail*}

sunsite.unc.edu:@file{/pub/Linux/system/Fido/ifmail*}

@item
@code{dialog}

Dialog is a very nice shell tool to simplify input/output functions in
shell scripts. All the programs in @file{mgetty/frontends/dialog/} rely on
it. It runs on most operating systems (except FreeBSD), as long as they
have a @code{curses} library. The source can be found on

sunsite.unc.edu:@file{/pub/Linux/utils/shell/dialog*}

@item
@code{ps2g3}

is a small package to integrate @code{mgetty+sendfax} into the NeXTStep
operating system. It can be found on ftp.leo.org in the directory
@file{/pub/comp/platforms/next/Tools/postscript/ps2g3.s.tar.gz}.

@item
@code{dvips5.47}

Dvips 5.x and up create a strange kind of postscript that, when converted
with Ghostscript 3.x, produces Fax files that can not be faxed to paper
fax machines (modems work fine) because the line width isn't exactly 1728
pixels. Dvips 5.47 doesn't do this. It can be found on:

@file{ftp.leo.org:/pub/comp/os/unix/networking/mgetty/dvips*}

@file{midway.uchicago.edu:pub/tex/dvips/dvips547.tar.Z}

@item
@code{g3vga}

Is a nice, fast G3 viewer for Linux and SVGALIB (standard console mode, no
X11). You can find it in @file{.../apps/graphics/viewers} on all mirrors
of SunSITE.unc.edu.

@item
Caz Yokoyama, for his suggestions concerning faxspool and the mail-to-fax
gateway

@item
Martin Husemann, for SVR4 testing (damn ESIX) and the NetBSD 386 port

@strong{very} helpful solving some ZyXEL-specific and generic fax
questions.

@item
ELSA Computer GmbH, Germany, for giving me a number of test modems and
