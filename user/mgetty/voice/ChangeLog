	* libvoice/detect.c: add ATI codes for recent MT5634ZPX modem
	variants (most of them mapping to V253modem driver)

2004-11-16  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c:
	- Added support for the macro NO_STRSTR, mentioned in mgetty/Makefile.

	* libvoice/V253modem.c:
	- The function strcasestr s only availble with glibc. Therefore
	  replaced strcasestr with macro mSTRSTR which is either strcasestr or
	  strstr, depending on the macro __USE_GNU like in <string.h>.

	* libvoice/UMC.c: - Removed the unused variable dletx.

2004-10-30  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c: - Enabled silence detection threshold setting.

2004-10-09  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/detect.c: - Corrected the debug messages.

	* libvoice/V253modem.c:
	- Added the missing return, if the compression table is disabled.

	* libvoice/detect.c, include/default.h, include/hardware.h, voice.conf-dist:
	- The V253ugly modem, which use V253 commands but not AT+IFC could be
	  forced by configuration file

	* libvoice/V253ugly.c: - Corrected canstant names for the flow commands

	* libvoice/V253modem.c, include/default.h, voice.conf-dist:
	- Defaults for the V253 compression table are now configurable as
	  requested by Peter <tkvoice@charter.net> and ChrisJW@rccw.com
	- Compression mapping querrying can now disabled with the config file.

2004-10-09  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/detect.c, include/default.h, include/hardware.h, voice.conf-dist:
	- The V253ugly modem, which use V253 commands but not AT+IFC could be
	  forced by configuration file

	* libvoice/V253ugly.c: - Corrected canstant names for the flow commands

	* libvoice/V253modem.c, include/default.h, voice.conf-dist:
	- Defaults for the V253 compression table are now configurable as
	  requested by Peter <tkvoice@charter.net> and ChrisJW@rccw.com
	- Compression mapping querrying can now disabled with the config file.

2004-09-18  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c:
	- Added voice string 4-BIT ADPCM to V253_querry_compressions().

2004-09-11  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c:
	- Replaced strstr call with strcasestr, because some modems have
	  lower case responds in their AT+VSM=? answers.

2004-09-07  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/Makefile, libvoice/V253ugly.c, libvoice/ugly_V253modem.c:
	- Added V253ugly.c, which should be a driver for modems which are
	  nearly V253 but don't support the flow control command AT+IFC.

	* libvoice/Elsa.c, libvoice/V253modem.c, include/V253modem.h:
	- Moved the definition of ELSA_RMD_NAME to V253modem.h, which is
	  included by Elsa.c and V253modem.c, so that it is sure, that both
	  use the same string.

2004-08-22  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c:
	- Added voice compression 16 bit linear to Kompressiontable.
	- Mapped voice format 16 bit unsigned linear
	  to vgetty compression id: V253modem,13.
	- V253_querry_compressions() updates now entries Kompressiontable[0],
	  Kompressiontable[1] and Kompressiontable[0] if "8-BIT LINEAR" or 8
	  bit PCM voice format is detected in modem AT+VSM=? response.

	* doc/compression_settings, pvftools/pvftormd.c, pvftools/rmdtopvf.c:

	- Marked patches for duples voice with:
	     // juergen.kosel@gmx.de : voice-duplex-patch start
	  and
	     // juergen.kosel@gmx.de : voice-duplex-patch end

	* doc/compression_settings, pvftools/pvftormd.c, pvftools/rmdtopvf.c:
	- Mapped voice format 16 bit unsigned linear
	  to vgetty compression id: V253modem,13.

	* libvoice/Makefile, libvoice/depend:

	  and
	     // juergen.kosel@gmx.de : voice-duplex-patch end

2004-08-15  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c, include/V253modem.h:
	- Vgetty will now querry the available modem compressions and
	update a table from this.
	
	- The set compression function will use this table.


2004-05-23  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/Lucent.c:
	- Modified for duplex voice (inserted the placeholders).

2004-05-21  Juergen Kosel  <juergen.kosel@gmx.de>

	* libvoice/ugly_V253modem.c: New file.

	* pvftools/rmdtopvf.c, pvftools/pvftormd.c: added 16 bit voice

	* libvoice/V253modem.c, libvoice/IS_101.c:
	merged in changes of mgetty 1.1.30 and for duplex voice

	* libvoice/V253modem.c: - merged in my changes for duplex voice

Wed Feb 20 18:29:39 MET 2002  Gert Doering <gert@greenie.muc.de>

	* Perl/Vgetty.pm: re-enable reading of READY on init

2002-01-02  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@defian.alphanet.ch>

	* Added Tcl/Tk frontend by Peter Bruley <pbruley@highstream.net>

2001-12-22  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@defian.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.32

	* Fixed libpvf/usr.c compilation warning.

	* Enhancements to doc/Readme.voice_shell.

	* Fix to libvoice/shell.c

	* New modem detections: Zoom V.90 (Ulises Vega <uvega@technitrade.com>)

	* Man page for vgetty.8 by by Barry Stewart <bstewart@smyrnacable.net>

	* Support of the ISA Multitech from
	Miles Lott <milos@speakeasy.net> (id 132).

2001-10-28  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@defian.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.31

	* Fix from Juergen Kosel and Steffen Klupsch to Elsa.c, so to
	accept VCON also when changing output devices.

2001-07-23  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@defian.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.30

	* Fix in libvoice/shell.c regarding missing `break's causing
	the DEVICE voice shell command to return three results (READY,
	DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE, ERROR). Patch by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vsu.ru>.

	* Fix in libvoice/IS_101.c: the IS_101_wait() function has been
	redesigned to cope with non atomic DLE sequences. Bug found by
	Alan Ferrency <alan@pair.com>, however fix isn't confirmed yet.

Wed May 16 19:15:01 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.29.

	* Patch from Olivier Kurzweg <okurzweg@siticom.com> for handling
	LOOP_BREAK event (which is IS-101 remote hangup). I also documented
	this in doc/Readme.voice_shell.

Mon May 14 11:08:03 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Patch from Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de to ignore some V.253
	event strings and support for vgetty to ignore it.
	
	* Patches to pvftormd, rmdtopvf, autopvf and pvftoau from
	Olivier Kurzweg <okurzweg@siticom.com>, for G.711A support.
	Enabled G.711A support for Digi RAS, Lucent, V.253 and ISDN4Linux.
	Enabled G.711u support for V.253. Added a few integrity checks on
	supported sample rates (e.g. ISN4Linux only supports 8kHz).
	Better -L list. Cleanup.

Sun Mar 11 13:08:29 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added fix for vm voice shell execution result in vm/main.c,
	submitted by Diomidis Spinellis <dspin@aegean.gr>.

	* All of below is 0.9.27.

	* Fix to vgetty/answer.c (incomplete arguments), submitted
	by Diomidis Spinellis <dds@aueb.gr>.

	* man pages for pvftools, contributed by
	Mikkel L. Ellertson <mikkel@infinity-ltd.com>.

	* Voice shell interface changes by Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de, to
	provide the new error DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE. Adapted the
	documentation. Now using a single constant string for
	error and for ready in libvoice/shell.c.

Sat Feb 24 16:15:03 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.26.

	* Added support in the PVF tools of the 81 RMD type for the
	  ZyXEL 2864, aka Mu-law PCM.

Sat Feb 24 10:25:25 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.25.

	* Support for the Lucent-based Modem Blaster USB modem,
	contributed by Glen Stewart <root@associate.com>.

	* Steffen Klupsch <steffen@vlsi.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>
 	and Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de contributed changes to enhance
 	voice_set_device(), and V253modem definitions.
	Enhanced distinctive ringing. Enhancements for ELSA and
	V253modem. New `forceV253' option in configuration to override
	detection. Fixed dependancies. New `devicetest' command in vm, which
	lists the supported output devices. Different set of message
	files option in configuration. Out of area and private service
	token.
	
	* Fixes from Matti Airas <mairas@iki.fi> for a better hangup
	detection with ISDN4Linux. Will probably require similar changes
	to all of the drivers. Also fix for Vgetty.pm to support it,
	including documentation, and fix to avoid Vgetty.pm to litter
	STDERR with `uninitialized value' errors.

	* Added reference to an Interactive Voice Response System
	which uses the pvftools, but otherwise seems to have reimplemented,
	in Perl, the US Robotics modem support, to the Readme.

	* Added two documentations in doc/, contributed by
	Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de.
	
	* Added support for the internal modem MultiTech MT5634ZPX-PCI,
	contributed by Michael Dratz <md@1box.de>, including changes
	to pvf utils.

	* Added synonymous "NO DIALTONE" in libvoice/analyze.c, contributed
	by Michael Dratz <md@1box.de> and required in at least one
	Multitech variant.

	* Contribution from Hermann Hüni for using the vgetty interface
	from a Tcl/Tk script.

Mon Jan 29 23:38:15 MET 2001  Gert Doering <gert@greenie.muc.de>

	* voice/libvoice/init.c: make "mgetty" speed the same as 
	"voice.conf" speed (avoid bug with "RING at wrong port speed").

Wed Jan 17 12:34:35 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Reverted some changes in 1.16 to 1.17 of libvoice/US_Robotics.c
	which were completely bizarre, and made beeping fail. Found
 	by Chun-Chung Chen <cjj@u.washington.edu>.

Sun Jan 14 15:17:34 2001  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.23

	* Fixed buffer overflow in vm and vgetty, submitted by Georg
 	Kirschbaum, <Georg.Kirschbaum@gimmel.franken.de>. Impact would
	not have been very big since only DTMFs are under control
	of the user.

Sat Dec 16 10:36:34 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.22

	* Applied patch for Rockwell, submitted by Colin Panisset,
 	<Colin.Panisset@Sun.COM>, to at least support transmit/receive
	gains on the Spirit Cobra modem. If the values are set to 0
	in the configuration, they won't be set (which was the previous
	situation). This chipset uses the AT#TL=xxxx and AT#RG=xxxx commands
 	to set the relevant levels, where xxxx is a hex string from
 	0001 to FFFF.
	
	* Some modems have no meaningful output except in ATI9, but
	they do not respect the standard. For them we will use
	another table of partial matches. We do not want to slow
	even more by adding ATI9s to the global table. This should
	fix the Rockwell issue, and make Neuhaus still work while
	not adding any overhead. In libvoice/detect.c
	  
	
Sat Oct 14 11:06:01 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.21

	* Completely reworked the way the special case Supra56ePRO
	works, since it was causing timeouts/delay at initialization
	time for both the TP560 Data/Fax/Voice 56K Modem and
	the good ol' 1496. (BTW mine just broke, so I hope that
	others will test it. Symptoms: switch on with CD/OH/DSR/CTS
	light. TXD blinks when typing on keyboard (e.g. with cu
	with DTR/RTS/etc set), global fw reset doesn't work anymore).

Sat Sep 16 18:38:14 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.19

	* Added detection of modem ``TP560 Data/Fax/Voice 56K Modem'',
	with friendly testing from Zsolt KOZAK <kozakzs@webigen.com>.
	Note that that modem has buggy ATI3 handling, and this will
	cause a timeout, which will be recovered. The test was done
	at speed 115200. [ well infact this was not a buggy firmware,
	see above ]

Tue Sep 12 23:09:42 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.18

	* Added new modem type Supra56ePRO, strongly based on
	Supra.c; submitted by Rojhalat Ibrahim, roschi@ribrahim.de.
	It seems we had to also implement ATI3 detection.
	
Mon Sep 11 13:30:25 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>
	
	* libvoice/ISDN4Linux.c: using correct return code (cosmetic)
	in answer_phone().

	* libvoice/US_Robotics.c: using correct return code (cosmetic)
	in answer_phone().

	* vgetty/answer.c: if modem-specific code returns fax, forward
 	that to the mgetty caller. Note that mgetty doesn't yet support
 	this fully.
	
Sun Sep 10 09:36:26 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* libvoice/V253modem.c: fix Kompressionmethod default setting
	(gcc warning; could lead to Kompressionmethod 0 in an uncontrolled
	way). Fixed comment for compression method 9.

	* vgetty/answer.c: voice message file with a more unique name
	(with timestamp).

Sat Sep  9 09:57:31 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.17

	* libvoice/Elsa.c: minor fix with no consequence so that
	gcc doesn't spit out a `warning: `/*' within comment'
	warning.

	* pvftools/pvftormd.c: patch from Mark K. Kim <markkim@email.com>
	fixing the wrong assumption that the compression method is
	the bits-per-sampling rate, which is wrong for USR (GSM).
	I find this change a bit bizarre (why hasn't anyone reported this),
	and it could be a firmware problem. Well, let's see what it
	breaks and hope people scream loudly.

	* libvoice/V253modem.c: patch from Juergen Kosel <Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de>
	implementing new voiceformats, and check_rmd_adequation() for
	Elsa compatibility. Caller ID and distinctive ringing; setting
	defaults (silence sensitivity; timeout). Added CVS ID. Note that
	this version has a gcc warning; notified Juergen.
 	
	* libvoice/Elsa.c: patch from Juergen Kosel <Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de>
	fixing AT+VRN and adding comments about VLS.

	* pvftools/rmdtopvf.c: patch from Juergen Kosel <Juergen.Kosel@gmx.de>;
	implements header management for some new voice formats.

	* libvoice/ZyXEL_Omni56k.c: fixed by gert; fix from Richard L. Hamilton
 	(rlhamil@smart.net); ATS40= commande shall not contain spaces.

	* libvoice/IS_101.c: fixed by gert; fix from Andrew Morris
 	(Andrew.Morris@cnpl.enbridge.com); fix to watchdog change;
	bug introduced in 0.9.16. Would never reset the watchdog
	after the first reset.

	* voice.conf-dist: fixed by gert; comment that the speed
	definition must match mgetty's.
	
Thu Aug 10 08:14:50 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.16

	* The fix from Andrew Morris involving libm functions has
	three problems: Gert doesn't like it, you need to link
	-lm to vgetty, and Gert doesn't like it. Changed it so that
	we don't require -lm nor floating point arithmetic, and
	so it gives the sames values as the fp was doing.

Wed Aug  9 21:56:34 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fix from Andrew Morris <Andrew.Morris@cnpl.enbridge.com> for
	libvoice/US_Robotics.c silence detection threshold, rounding up
	the silence detection so that the values are more uniformly
 	distributed.

	* Modified IS_101.c so that the watchdog uses a timer instead
	of doing complicated arithmetic on expected bps rate.
	Patch by Andrew Morris <Andrew.Morris@cnpl.enbridge.com>.
	As a side effect, the I/O data summary will now come every
	N seconds and not every N bytes. I don't think we should care.

Wed Aug  9 09:04:25 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.14

	* Fixed bug in modem detection (introduced in 0.9.13) (NULL
	pointer dereference).

	* Made Rockwell test on ATI6 broader.

Fri Jul 28 12:12:12 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.13

	* Fixed the V253 problems we introduced in 0.9.12 and which
	were causing problems with most drivers. Fix by
	Juergen Kosel <Juergen.Kosel@elsa.de>, with the impulsion
	of Const Kaplinsky <const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru>. Now the
	detection is done either with PNP IDs (with a set of
	new entries for Elsa modems), or, if everything else fails,
	by checking a standard V253 command.

	* Renamed V250modem.c to V253modem.c

Sat Jul 22 11:17:13 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.12 (there was no 0.9.11).

	* Added hints in contrib/K_C_Yuen-Zoom-2949L-Hints for
        the 2949L modem setup.
 
	* Implemented ringback in Elsa.c, requested by Martin
 	Haefele <mhaefe@correo.e-technik.uni-ulm.de>.

	* Patch from Juergen Kosel <Juergen.Kosel@elsa.de> for supporting
	the V250modem, for which a 115200 bps is recommended.

	* Patch from Const Kaplinsky <const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru> fixing
	the long-standing WAV conversion bugs. Added comment in
	the example conversion script.
	The patch fixes:
           - byte order problems in writing 16- and 32-bit samples to WAV
             (RIFF) files;
           - unsafe code for reading 16-bit samples from WAV files;
           - a problem with error message "unsupported number of bits per
             sample" which was printing on each sample of input WAV files.
	
	* Patch from Const Kaplinsky <const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru> for
	support of the Omni 56k in the PVF utilities.

	* Fix for libvoice/ZyXEL_Omni56K.c (also use the RMD adequation
	routine of IS101 we introduced in 0.9.10).

Sun Jun 11 12:56:41 2000  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* All of below is 0.9.10

	* Added new voice.conf voice_shell_log for voice shell stderr
	output. If not specified, we use the previous behaviour (send
	stderr to modem).

	* Added new voice shell command to send modem-specific
	commands from the voice shell (QUOTE), submitted by
	<gonz@ratloop.com>.

	* Added support for ZyXEL Omni 56k, submitted by 
	<const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru>. Also patch for libvoice/write.c
	from same author with this explanation:
	    We add small delays if we cannot write to the modem when
	    its input buffer is full, also when the OS returns EAGAIN.
	    This will fix some buffer underruns reported by the voice
	    modem.
        I haven't applied the faxlib patch (this is for gert to
	apply). This however includes Russian Caller-ID for ZyXEL Omni 56k.

	* Applied patch for vm help submitted by <const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru>.

	* Applied patch for creating files with the caller ID in automatic
        answerer vgetty mode vm help submitted by <const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru>.

	* Added detection of a Rockwell variant <virus@altavista.net>

	* Added scripts/dtmf_alpha.sh, with much more examples
	of how to use the voice shell interface, contributed by
	Robert Jördens <rjo@gmx.de>.

	* Added alpha patch to support the Supra56ePRO in contrib/,
	submitted by <ibrahim@surf-callino.de>.

	* Fix for some USRobotics variant sometimes returning OK and
	sometimes VCON in hardwflow, submitted by <robert@cstr.ed.ac.uk>.

	* Detection of the Lasat Safire 288V by <gunter.grau@01019freenet.de>.

	* Added a Vgetty.pm implementation in sh and example to scripts/,
	submitted by John Wehle <john@feith.com>.

Sat Dec  4 10:25:32 MET 1999   Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed spelling error in scripts/message.sh

Thu Dec  2 10:25:32 MET 1999   Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added ability for voice modem drivers to specify what they support
	as RMD format (added new function check_rmd_adequation(),
	defined like the old behaviour in libvoice/IS_101.c, and inherited
	by every voice modem driver except ZyXEL_2864, which inherit
	ZyXEL_1496 behaviour which is to accept either ZyXEL 2864
	or ZyXEL 1496. Compression level/speed adequation is then
	still checked as usual in libvoice/play.c. This was requested
	by Gert and obsoletes the need for the not-so-nice dd header
	conversion script.
	
Sat Nov 13 10:31:37 MET 1999   Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Released mgetty-1.1.21-to-current-13111999
	
	Those two changes absolutely need wide testing:
	
	* Removed the enter_fax_mode() function from libvoice/mode.c,
	and moved the enter_data_fax_mode() from vgetty/answer.c to
	libvoice/mode.c. This ensures that there is only one way to
	answer and go data or fax from voice mode. Before, we had two,
	each one with its own set of bugs. This changes the way answering
	is done, also the going to fax/data when a voice shell fails,
	but also GET_FAX and SEND_FAX voice shell commands.

	* Patched the resulting libvoice/mode.c with the recently posted
	patch (from Dmitri Pogosyan), which should fix the Rockwell
	problem when going from voice to fax/data. The idea being that
	you use auto-detection ONLY if answer_mode is ANSWER_DATA|ANSWER_FAX.
	Else, if it's only one of the two, you switch off modem
	autodetection (+FAA=0) so that +FCLASS state is used.

	Those changes are presumably minor:

	* Patched libvoice/detect.c to support the Italian version of the
	Rockwell modem (Rockwell compatible modem 33600), submitted
	by <Free Ekanayaka> ekafree@freemail.it.

	* Added setup information for PowerBit modems to
	contrib/PowerBit_Olsson, submitted by Håkan Olsson,
 	<suntron@algonet.se>
	
Sat Oct  9 15:01:32 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added contrib/Raoul_Boenisch about some Dr. Neuhaus speed-related
 	problems and fixes.

	* Added doc/NOTE about where to find some documentation.

	* Modified libvoice/detect.c and libvoice/README.lucent for supporting
	some Lucent variant. jsrockford@my-Deja.com is presumably testing it.
	Also cleanuped detect.c (using variables). Note that Lucent is
        not implemented yet: read libvoice/README.lucent for guidelines
        if you have this modem's documentation.

	* libvoice/signal.c: added child pid in log file. Also, now
	capturing the exit status instead of ignoring it, and logging
	at WARN level if non zero. Suggested by Gert.

	* Added scripts/new_voice.craig_southern from
 	     http://www.southeren.com/craig/vgetty/

	* Added ability, in vm, to output to the EXTERNAL_SPEAKER (-e
	option). Patch submitted by baitisj@cyberdude.com.

Thu Sep 16 11:06:43 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added detection support for ZyXEL Omni 56k. Some issues
	still remaining, such as DTMF preference setting command.

	* Adding ability to use either the new AT+IFC or the old AT\Q3
	in Elsa, with dynamic adjustment in case of error. We now
	try AT+IFC first. Reported by Steffen Klupsch, and fix
	suggested by Gert. Simplified Elsa's internals. Reported to
	work (eschmann@stud.uni-frankfurt.de).
	
	* Fixed bug with libvoice/signal.c regarding child termination.
	The fix works on HPUX (says boban@zaslon.si), and maybe also
	fixes the Solaris coredump problems. At this time, this fix
	is untested on other plateforms, but presumably should do
	something nice anyway.

Wed Sep  8 16:10:46 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed bug with libvoice/US_Robotics.c: wrong command
	introduced in 1.1.21 (ringback). Would cause the modem
 	[Sportster Voice 33.6] to report an error and stop responding
 	to any further commands. Fix by <alborchers@steinerpoint.com>

	* Added comment of John Lowry <jlowry@netcom.com> about fixing
	some problems with dial out and NO_DIAL_TONE with vm in
	voice/contrib/John_Lowry.
	
Sat Aug 21 14:12:09 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed perl module Perl/Vgetty.pm (undefined reference).

	* Work-around for ATH0 in Rockwell_set_device() breakimg
	  the RC32ACL (zukerman@math-hat.com).

	* Added a few problems to fix to Todo, some being fixed, some not.

Wed Aug 11 22:57:55 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Had a nice eclipse :)

	* Fixed libvoice/UMC.c's use of C++ style comment (one define
	commented with ANSI C). This shows up e.g. with plain ANSI
	C compilers, or old versions of gcc.

	* Changed version to 0.9.6 / 11Aug99 so to make it a little
	different.

Sat Jul 24 14:26:46 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* gert released 1.1.21
	
	* doc/Readme.voice_shell: updated with the new commands.
	
Tue Jul 20 08:49:10 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Timeouts for ringback: if no ringback is detected within the timeout
	time, the modem assumes the other side answered the phone (was
	needed for outgoing dial). Note that not all modems support these
	commands (+VRA/+VRN). Notably the Multitechs don't. This adds new
	configuration options: ``ringback_goes_away'' and
	``CONF(ringback_never_came, 100, CT_INT)'', see include/default.h
	and voice.conf-dist.
 	
	* The US Robotics modem forgets its voice setting when it leaves voice
 	mode: a special function voice_mode_on() was created.
 	
	* Sending a beep to US Robotics turns the speaker on, we shut it
 	down (best way would be to keep it how it was).
 	
	* Added ``GET MODEM'' voice shell interface command to get the
 	underlying modem hardware type (e.g. for sending the right RMD file
 	type).
 	
	* Added a new ``linger'' optional argument to the play command. When
 	given, it will make the multi-DTMF detection more reliable when used
 	with ``AUTOSTOP'': with some modems, or with some configurations, it
 	seems that between the time ``PLAY'' and ``WAIT'' are issued you can
 	loose key-presses, especially with US Robotics modems.

	* All the above for Jul 20 was submitted by Al BORCHERS,
	<alborchers@steinerpoint.com>

Sun Jul 18 19:31:49 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Incremental bug fix for US_Robotics.c submitted by
	"Luca Olivetti" <luca@olivetti.dhis.org> for the external or
	internal speaker beep conflicting with line work-around.
	
	* Added EXTERNAL_SPEAKER support in shell.c, contributed
	by "Luca Olivetti" <luca@olivetti.dhis.org>.

	* Added some files in contrib/
	
Sun Jul  4 09:13:10 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed libutil/access.c to set EGID before EUID so that it is
	possible.
	
Sun Jun 27 12:16:20 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* The owner, groups and mode were only set after the file
 	recording was complete. Moreover, the file was created without any
 	correct security checks. Now, we switch the EUID/EGID/umask of the
 	process when opening the file. That should fix the specific user
 	request (not having files root.root 644 when recording), and also
 	fix more serious security problems. Additionnally, we now do the
 	same when playing a file. This is done through a new set of
	functions in libutil/access.c. Problem reported by
	uzs7ph@uni-bonn.de.

	* Calling the new function setup_environment() from
	vgetty/answer.c's vgetty_answer function. This renders *some*
	of the called-ID specific patch obsolete, and it was slightly
	rewritten for that purpose. This was suggested by gert.

	* Added new set_device mode definitions (suggestion by
	Steffen Klupsch <steffen@vlsi.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>, see
	also voice/contrib/Steffen_Klupsch-new-set-device-modes).

Tue Jun 15 14:28:20 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added a modem quirk field in the include/hardware.h modem structure.
	Defined VMQ_NEEDS_SET_DEVICE_BEFORE_ANSWER to reverse, if set, the
 	order of answering/setting line for the modems which are broken in
 	that aspect. This field is set to zero for all modems, except
	UMC. Reported by steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de.

	* Fixed bug with Compaq_VS.c which had the recently added
	play_dtmf missing (should have seen that in compilation, hey ?).

	* Added an unconditionnal ``go to voice mode'' in libvoice/UMC.c,
	this fixes the ``modem doesn't know in which state he is'' bug
	reported & fixed by steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de.

	* Modified vgetty/answer.c to support the above modem quirk bit.

	* libvoice/UMC.c: fixed the 'beep' command, the UMC_VTS_WORKAROUND
 	produced a horrible and loud scream, the modem command at#vts
 	sounds better :-) (steffen@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de).

	* libvoice/UMC.c: setting default compression to 4 bit ADPCM,
 	because only this is supported by the pvftools.

	* Changed the faxmode command from 'AT+FCLASS=' to 'AT#CLS='
	-- this is said to be better regarding call discrimination.
 	(At least for UMC modems.)

	* voice/pvftools/pvftormd.c and voice/pvftools/rmdtopvf.c:
	added support for UMC's 4 Bit ADPCM.
	
Sat May 15 21:53:52 MEST 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Added information/patch for old 5.x 1496 ZyXEL. As those
	problems are no longer found with the current 6.x ROM version
	(such as 6.19), I just include the information/patch as-is
	in voice/contrib/Wolfram_Gloger
	
	* Added script example to make MultiTech 2834ZDXv dial out and
	play voice message to voice/contrib/Mark_Haun

	* RING_DETECTED is now supported as an event in WAITING (event.c)

	* Added temporary Smarty/Neuhaus detection. This could break
 	Rockwell modems. In case it does, change the #if 0 at line
	63 to #if 1 and report this to me (detect.c). Contributed by
	Raoul.Boenisch@uni-essen.de.

	* Enabled support for the INTERNAL_MICROPHONE for Dr_Neuhaus.c
	(for the Smarty; contributed by Raoul.Boenisch@uni-essen.de)

	* Fixed Multitech_2834.c: would not go correctly to
	DIALUP_LINE (but to LOCAL_HANDSET instead). Submitted
	by alborchers@steinerpoint.com. Same fix reported
	to the other instances (5634, but NOT 5600ZDXv since
	already fixed it seems).

	* Fixed Multitech_2834.c: sometimes the fixup echo
	workaround wouldn't work with some firmwares. Made it so
	the fix is inactive if echo is disabled. Reported this
	fix to  the other instances (5634, but NOT 5600ZDXv since
	already fixed it seems).
	Submitted by alborchers@steinerpoint.com

	* US_Robotics.c:
	     - added URL for technical documentation
	     - patch by gmilner@my-dejanews.com for local handset support
	     - patch by Niels@Basjes.nl to ignore DIAL TONE when
	       recording or playing (bug work-around).

	* Updated ToDo files

	* Updated the FAQ. Warning, this might not be in sequence with
	  the official FAQ. This has to be worked-around some time now.
	
Tue Mar 16 11:02:26 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>

	* Fixed so that when PNP detection fails (ATI9) we correctly
	revert to ATI, eating output when needed. This was reported by
	Al Borchers alborchers@steinerpoint.com. This should fix
	many problems encountered by people upgrading to 1.1.20
	plus the 10021999 global patch.

Wed Feb 10 07:17:57 1999  Marc SCHAEFER  <schaefer@vulcan.alphanet.ch>
