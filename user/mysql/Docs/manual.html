<P>
This is the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> reference manual; it documents <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
up to Version 4.0.16. Functional changes are always
indicated with reference to the version, so this manual is also suitable
if you are using an older version of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software
(such as 3.23 or 4.0-production).
There are also references for version 5.0 (development).

</P>
<P>
Being a reference manual, it does not provide general instruction on
<CODE>SQL</CODE> or relational database concepts.

</P>
<P>
As the <CODE>MySQL Database Software</CODE> is under constant development,
the manual is also updated frequently.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>constant</CODE>
<DD>
Constant-width font is used for command names and options; SQL statements;
database, table, and column names; C and Perl code; and environment variables.
Example: ``To see how <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> works, invoke it with the
<CODE>--help</CODE> option.''

<DT><TT>`filename'</TT>
<DD>
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames and
pathnames.  Example: ``The distribution is installed under the
<TT>`/usr/local/'</TT> directory.''

<DT><SAMP>`c'</SAMP>
<DD>
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is also used to indicate
character sequences.  Example: ``To specify a wildcard, use the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
character.''

<DT><EM>italic</EM>
<DD>
Italic font is used for emphasis, <EM>like this</EM>.

<DT><STRONG>boldface</STRONG>
<DD>
Boldface font is used in table headings and to convey
<STRONG>especially strong emphasis</STRONG>.
</DL>

<P>
When commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular
program, the program is indicated by a prompt shown before the command.  For
example, <CODE>shell&#62;</CODE> indicates a command that you execute from your login
shell, and <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> indicates a command that you execute from the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client program:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; type a shell command here
mysql&#62; type a mysql command here
</PRE>

<P>
Shell commands are shown using Bourne shell syntax.  If you are using a
<CODE>csh</CODE>-style shell, you may need to issue commands slightly differently.
For example, the sequence to set an environment variable and run a command
looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; VARNAME=value some_command
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>csh</CODE>, you would execute the sequence like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; setenv VARNAME value
shell&#62; some_command
</PRE>

<P>
Database, table, and column names must often be substituted into commands.  To
indicate that such substitution is necessary, this manual uses
<CODE>db_name</CODE>, <CODE>tbl_name</CODE>, and <CODE>col_name</CODE>.  For example, you might
see a statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would supply
your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;
</PRE>

<P>
SQL keywords are not case-sensitive and may be written in uppercase or
lowercase.  This manual uses uppercase.

</P>
<P>
In syntax descriptions, square brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>) are used
to indicate optional words or clauses.  For example, in the following
statement, <CODE>IF EXISTS</CODE> is optional:

</P>

<PRE>
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the alternatives
are separated by vertical bars (<SAMP>`|'</SAMP>).  When one member from a set of
choices <STRONG>may</STRONG> be chosen, the alternatives are listed within square
brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)
</PRE>

<P>
When one member from a set of choices <STRONG>must</STRONG> be chosen, the
alternatives are listed within braces (<SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
{DESCRIBE | DESC} tbl_name {col_name | wild}

<DT><CODE>MySQL</CODE> is a database management system.
<DD>
A database is a structured collection of data.  It may be anything from a
simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of
information in a corporate network.  To add, access, and process data
stored in a computer database, you need a database management system
such as <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Server.  Since computers are very good at handling large
amounts of data, database management systems play a central role in computing,
as stand-alone utilities or as parts of other applications.

<A NAME="IDX18"></A>

<DT>MySQL is a relational database management system.
<DD>
A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting
all the data in one big storeroom.  This adds speed and flexibility.
The <CODE>SQL</CODE> part of ``<CODE>MySQL</CODE>'' stands for ``<CODE>Structured
Query Language</CODE>''. SQL is the most common standardised language used to
access databases and is defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL Standard.(The SQL 
standard has been evolving since 1986 and several versions exist. In this 
manual, ''<CODE>SQL-92</CODE>'' refers to the standard released in 1992,
''<CODE>SQL-99</CODE>'' refers to the standard released in 1999, and
''<CODE>SQL:2003</CODE>'' refers to the version of the standard that is expected
to be released in mid-2003.We use the term ''<CODE>the SQL standard</CODE>'' to 
mean the current version of the SQL Standard at any time.)

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<DT>MySQL software is <CODE>Open Source</CODE>.
<DD>
<CODE>Open Source</CODE> means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify the software.
Anybody can download the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software from the Internet and use it
without paying anything.  If you wish, you may study the source code
and change it to suit your needs.  The <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software uses the
<CODE>GPL</CODE> (<CODE>GNU General Public License</CODE>),
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>, to define what you
may and may not do with the software in different situations.
If you feel uncomfortable with the <CODE>GPL</CODE> or need to embed
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> code into a commercial application you can buy a
commercially licensed version from us.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_licenses">1.4.3  MySQL Licenses</A>.

<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>

<DT>Why use the MySQL Database Server?
<DD>
The <CODE>MySQL Database Server</CODE> is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.
If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try.
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> also has a practical set of features developed in
close cooperation with our users.  You can find a performance comparison
of <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> with other database managers on our benchmark page.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> was originally developed to handle large databases
much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in
highly demanding production environments for several years.  Though
under constant development, <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> today offers a rich and
useful set of functions.  Its connectivity, speed, and security make
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.

<DT>The technical features of MySQL Server
<DD>
For advanced technical information, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Reference">6  MySQL Language Reference</A>.
The <CODE>MySQL Database Software</CODE> is a client/server system that consists
of a multi-threaded <CODE>SQL</CODE> server that supports different backends,
several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools,
and a wide range of programming interfaces (APIs).

We also provide <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> as a multi-threaded library which you
can link into your application to get a smaller, faster, easier-to-manage
product.

<DT>There is a large amount of contributed MySQL software available.
<DD>
It is very likely that you will find that your favorite application or
language already supports the <CODE>MySQL Database Server</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX24"></A>

The official way to pronounce <CODE>MySQL</CODE> is ``My Ess Que Ell'' (not
``my sequel''), but we don't mind if you pronounce it as ``my sequel''
or in some other localised way.

We started out with the intention of using <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to connect to our
tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some
testing we came to the conclusion that <CODE>mSQL</CODE> was not fast enough nor
flexible enough for our needs.  This resulted in a new SQL interface to our
database but with almost the same API interface as <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.  This API was
chosen to ease porting of third-party code.

</P>
<P>
The derivation of the name <CODE>MySQL</CODE> is not clear.  Our base
directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix
``my'' for well over 10 years.  However, co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter
(some years younger) is also named My.  Which of the two gave its name to
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> is still a mystery, even for us.

</P>
<P>
The name of the MySQL Dolphin (our logo) is <CODE>Sakila</CODE>. <CODE>Sakila</CODE> was chosen
by the founders of MySQL AB from a huge list of names suggested by users
in our "Name the Dolphin" contest. The winning name was submitted by
Ambrose Twebaze, an open source software developer from Swaziland, Africa.
According to Ambrose, the name Sakila has its roots in SiSwati, the local
language of Swaziland. Sakila is also the name of a town in Arusha,
Tanzania, near Ambrose's country of origin, Uganda.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Internals and Portability
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Written in C and C++.  Tested with a broad range of different compilers.
<LI>

Works on many different platforms.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Uses GNU Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool for portability.
<LI>

APIs for C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Tcl.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Clients">11  MySQL APIs</A>.
<LI>

Fully multi-threaded using kernel threads.  This means it can easily
use multiple CPUs if available.
<LI>

Transactional and non-transactional storage engines.
<LI>

Very fast B-tree disk tables (MyISAM) with index compression.
<LI>

Relatively easy to add another storage engine. This is useful if you
want to add an SQL interface to an in-house database.
<LI>

A very fast thread-based memory allocation system.
<LI>

Very fast joins using an optimised one-sweep multi-join.
<LI>

In-memory hash tables which are used as temporary tables.
<LI>

SQL functions are implemented through a highly optimised class library and
should be as fast as possible.  Usually there isn't any memory allocation
at all after query initialisation.
<LI>

The <CODE>MySQL</CODE> code gets tested with Purify
(a commercial memory leakage detector) as well as with Valgrind,
a <CODE>GPL</CODE> tool (<a HREF="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/">http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/</a>).
<LI>

Available as client/server or embedded (linked) version.
</UL>

<DT>Column Types
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Many column types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 bytes
long, <CODE>FLOAT</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>,

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>.
<LI>

Fixed-length and variable-length records.
</UL>

<DT>Commands and Functions
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Full operator and function support in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clauses of queries.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)
    -&#62; FROM tbl_name
    -&#62; WHERE income/dependents &#62; 10000 AND age &#62; 30;
</PRE>

<LI>

Full support for SQL <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> and
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses.  Support
for group functions (<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>,
<CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>,
<CODE>AVG()</CODE>, <CODE>STD()</CODE>,
<CODE>SUM()</CODE>, <CODE>MAX()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>, and <CODE>GROUP_CONCAT()</CODE>).
<LI>

Support for <CODE>LEFT OUTER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</CODE> with both standard
SQL and ODBC syntax.
<LI>

Support for aliases on tables and columns as required by SQL-92.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> return
the number of rows that were changed (affected).  It is possible to return
the number of rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting to the
server.
<LI>

The <CODE>MySQL</CODE>-specific <CODE>SHOW</CODE> command can be used to retrieve
information about databases, tables, and indexes.  The <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command
can be used to determine how the optimiser resolves a query.
<LI>

Function names do not clash with table or column names.  For example,
<CODE>ABS</CODE> is a valid column name.  The only restriction is that for a
function call, no spaces are allowed between the function name and the
<SAMP>`('</SAMP> that follows it.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reserved_words">6.1.7  Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words?</A>.
<LI>

You can mix tables from different databases in the same query (as of
Version 3.22).
</UL>

<DT>Security
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

A privilege and password system that is very flexible and secure, and
allows host-based verification.  Passwords are secure because all
password traffic is encrypted when you connect to a server.
</UL>

<DT>Scalability and Limits
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Handles large databases.  We use <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> with databases that 
contain 50 million records. We also know of users that
use <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> with 60,000 tables and about 5,000,000,000 rows.
<LI>

Up to 32 indexes per table are allowed.  Each index may consist of 1 to 16
columns or parts of columns.  The maximum index width is 500 bytes
(this may be changed when compiling <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>).
An index may use a prefix of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> field.
</UL>

<DT>Connectivity
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Clients may connect to the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server using TCP/IP Sockets,
Unix Sockets (Unix), or Named Pipes (NT).
<LI>

ODBC (Open-DataBase-Connectivity) support for Win32 (with source).
All ODBC 2.5 functions are supported, as are many others.  For example, you can use
MS Access to connect to your <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC">11.2  MySQL ODBC Support</A>.
</UL>

<DT>Localisation
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

The server can provide error messages to clients in many languages.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Languages">4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages</A>.
<LI>

Full support for several different character sets, including
ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), german, big5, ujis, and more.  For example,
the Scandinavian characters <SAMP>`@^a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`@"a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`@"o'</SAMP> are
allowed in table and column names.
<LI>

All data is saved in the chosen character set.  All comparisons for normal
string columns are case-insensitive.
<LI>

Sorting is done according to the chosen character set (the Swedish
way by default).  It is possible to change this when the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
server is started.  To see an example of very advanced sorting, look
at the Czech sorting code.  <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> supports many different
character sets that can be specified at compile and runtime.
</UL>

<DT>Clients and Tools
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Includes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, a very fast utility for table checking,
optimisation, and repair.  All of the functionality of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
is also available through the SQL interface.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<P>
Original code stems back from the early '80s, providing a stable code
base, and the ISAM table format remains backward-compatible.
At TcX, the predecessor of <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE>, <CODE>MySQL</CODE> code has worked
in projects since mid-1996, without any problems.
When the <CODE>MySQL Database Software</CODE> was released to a wider public,
our new users quickly found some pieces of ``untested code''. Each new release
since then has had fewer portability problems (even though each new release
has also had many new features).

</P>
<P>
Each release of the <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> has been usable. Problems have occurred
only when users try code from the ``gray zones.''  Naturally, new users
don't know what the gray zones are; this section therefore attempts to
document those areas that are currently known.
The descriptions mostly deal with Version 3.23 and 4.0 of <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>.
All known and reported bugs are fixed in the latest version, with the
exception of those listed in the bugs section, which are things that
are design-related.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.7.6  Known Errors and Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> design is multi-layered with independent modules.
Some of the newer modules are listed here with an indication of how
well-tested each of them is:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Replication -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
Large server clusters using replication are in production use, with
good results. Work on enhanced replication features is continuing
in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.x.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables -- Stable (in 3.23 from 3.23.49)</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> transactional storage engine has been declared
stable in the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 3.23 tree, starting from version 3.23.49.
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is being used in large, heavy-load production systems.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>BDB</CODE> tables -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>Berkeley DB</CODE> code is very stable, but we are still improving
the <CODE>BDB</CODE> transactional storage engine interface in
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>, so it will take some time before this is as well
tested as the other table types.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> -- Beta</STRONG>
<DD>
Full-text search works but is not yet widely used.
Important enhancements have been implemented in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>MyODBC 3.51</CODE> (uses ODBC SDK 3.51) -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
In wide production use. Some issues brought up appear to be
application-related and independent of the ODBC driver or underlying
database server.

<DT><STRONG>Automatic recovery of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
This status applies only to the new code in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> storage
engine that checks if the table was closed properly on open and
executes an automatic check/repair of the table if it wasn't.

<DT><STRONG>Bulk-insert -- Alpha</STRONG>
<DD>
New feature in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0 for faster
insert of many rows.

<DT><STRONG>Locking -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
This is very system-dependent.  On some systems there are big problems
using standard OS locking (<CODE>fcntl()</CODE>).  In these cases, you should
run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> flag.
Problems are known to occur on some Linux systems, and on SunOS when
using NFS-mounted filesystems.

</DL>

<P>
<CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> provides high-quality support for paying customers,
and the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> mailing list usually provides answers to common
questions. Bugs are usually fixed right away with a patch; for serious
bugs, there is almost always a new release.

<H3><A NAME="Table_size" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_size">1.2.4  How Big Can MySQL Tables Be?</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> Version 3.22 had a 4 GB (4 gigabyte) limit on table size. With the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Version 3.23, the maximum table
size was pushed up to 8 million terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes).

</P>
<P>
In effect, then, the table size for <CODE>MySQL</CODE> databases is normally
limited by the operating system.

</P>
<P>
Note, however, that operating systems have their own file-size
limits. Here are some examples:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Operating System</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>File-Size Limit</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Linux-Intel 32 bit </TD><TD> 2 GB, much more when using LFS
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Linux-Alpha </TD><TD> 8 TB (?)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.5.1 </TD><TD> 2 GB (possible 4GB with patch)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.6 </TD><TD> 4 GB (can be changed with flag)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.7 Intel </TD><TD> 4 GB
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.7 UltraSPARC </TD><TD> 512 GB
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
On Linux 2.2 you can get tables larger than 2 GB in size by using the LFS
patch for the ext2 filesystem. On Linux 2.4 patches also exist for ReiserFS
to get support for big files. Most current distributions are based on 
kernel 2.4 and already include all the required Large File Support (LFS)
patches. However, the maximum available file size still depends on several
factors, one of them being the file system used to store MySQL tables.

</P>
<P>
For a very detailed overview about LFS in Linux, have a look at Andreas
Jaeger's "Large File Support in Linux" page at
http://www.suse.de/~aj/linux_lfs.html.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>MySQL</CODE> tables have a maximum size of about 4 GB.  You can
check the maximum table size for a table with the <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE>
command or with the <CODE>myisamchk -dv table_name</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.7  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you need a table that will be larger than 4 GB in size (and your
operating system supports it), set the <CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> parameters accordingly when you create your table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can also set these parameters later, with
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your big table is a read-only table, you could use
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> to merge and compress many tables into one.
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> usually compresses a table by at least 50%, so you can
have, in effect, much bigger tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get around the operating system file limit for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
datafiles using the <CODE>RAID</CODE> option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Another solution can be the included <CODE>MERGE</CODE> library, which allows
you to handle a collection of identical tables as one.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Year_2000_compliance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Year_2000_compliance">1.2.5  Year 2000 Compliance</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> itself has no problems with Year 2000 (Y2K)
compliance:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> uses Unix time functions and has no problems with dates
until <CODE>2069</CODE>. All 2-digit years are considered to be in the range
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE>, which means that if you store <CODE>01</CODE> in a
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> column, <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> treats it as <CODE>2001</CODE>.

<LI>

All <CODE>MySQL</CODE> date functions are stored in one file, <TT>`sql/time.cc'</TT>,
and are coded very carefully to be year 2000-safe.

<LI>

In <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Version 3.22 and later, the <CODE>YEAR</CODE> column type
can store years <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE> in one byte and
display them using two or four digits.
</UL>

<P>
You may run into problems with applications that use <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>
in a way that is not Y2K-safe.  For example, many old applications store
or manipulate years using 2-digit values (which are ambiguous) rather than
4-digit values.  This problem may be compounded by applications that use
values such as <CODE>00</CODE> or <CODE>99</CODE> as ``missing'' value indicators.

</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these problems may be difficult to fix because different
applications may be written by different programmers, each of whom may
use a different set of conventions and date-handling functions.

</P>
<P>
Here is a simple demonstration illustrating that <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>
doesn't have any problems with dates until the year 2030:

</P>

This example shows that the <CODE>DATE</CODE> and <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> datatypes will not
give any problems with future dates (they handle dates until the year

Technical support from <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> means individualised answers
to your unique problems direct from the software engineers who code
the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database engine.

</P>
<P>
We try to take a broad and inclusive view of technical support. Almost
any problem involving <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software is important to us if it's
important to you.
Typically customers seek help on how to get different commands and
utilities to work, remove performance bottlenecks, restore crashed
systems, understand operating system or networking impacts on <CODE>MySQL</CODE>,
set up best practices for backup and recovery, utilise APIs, and so on.
Our support covers only the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server and our own utilities,
not third-party products that access the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server, though we
try to help with these where we can.

</P>
<P>
Detailed information about our various support options is given at

</P>
<P>
Technical support is like life insurance. You can live happily
without it for years, but when your hour arrives it becomes
critically important, yet it's too late to buy it.
If you use <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> for important applications and encounter
sudden difficulties, it may be too time consuming to figure out all the answers
yourself. You may need immediate access to the most experienced
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> troubleshooters available, those employed by <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE>.

<P>
The <CODE>GPL</CODE> license is contagious in the sense that when a program
is linked to a <CODE>GPL</CODE> program all the source code for all the parts
of the resulting product must also be released under the <CODE>GPL</CODE>.
If you do not follow this <CODE>GPL</CODE> requirement, you break the license 
terms and forfeit your right to use the <CODE>GPL</CODE> program altogether. 
You also risk damages.

</P>
<P>
You need a commercial license:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When you link a program with any <CODE>GPL</CODE> code from the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
software and don't want the resulting product to be licensed under <CODE>GPL</CODE>, 
perhaps because you want to build a commercial product or keep the added
non-<CODE>GPL</CODE> code closed source for other reasons. When purchasing
commercial licenses, you are not using the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software under
<CODE>GPL</CODE> even though it's the same code.

<LI>

When you distribute a non-<CODE>GPL</CODE> application that <STRONG>only</STRONG> works with the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> software and ship it with the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software. This type
of solution is considered to be linking even if it's done over a network.

<LI>

When you distribute copies of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software without providing
the source code as required under the <CODE>GPL</CODE> license.

<LI>

When you want to support the further development of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
database even if you don't formally need a commercial license.
Purchasing support directly from <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> is another good way
of contributing to the development of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software, with
immediate advantages for you.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.4.1  Support Offered by MySQL AB</A>.
</UL>

<P>
If you require a license, you will need one for each installation of the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> software. This covers any number of CPUs on a machine, and there
is no artificial limit on the number of clients that connect to the server
in any way.

see the generic FAQ from the Free Software Foundation at

Common uses of the <CODE>GPL</CODE> include:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When you distribute both your own application and the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
source code under the <CODE>GPL</CODE> with your product.

<LI>

When you distribute the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> source code bundled with other
programs that are not linked to or dependent on the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> system
for their functionality even if you sell the distribution commercially.
This is called mere aggregation in the <CODE>GPL</CODE> license.

<LI>

When you are not distributing <STRONG>any</STRONG> part of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
system, you can use it for free.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
When you are an Internet Service Provider (ISP), offering web hosting
with <CODE>MySQL</CODE> servers for your customers.
We encourage people to use ISPs that have MySQL support,
as this will give them the confidence that their ISP will, in fact, 
have the resources to solve any problems they may experience with 
the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> installation. Even if an ISP does not have
a commercial license for <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>, their customers 
should at least be given read access to the source of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
installation so that the customers can verify that it is correctly patched.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
When you use the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database software in conjunction with a
web server, you do not need a commercial license (so long as it is not
a product you distribute). This is true even if you run a commercial
web server that uses <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>, because you are not
distributing any part of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> system. However, in this
case we would like you to purchase <CODE>MySQL</CODE> support because the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> software is helping your enterprise.
</UL>

<P>
If your use of <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database software does not require a commercial
license, we encourage you to purchase support from <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> anyway.
This way you contribute toward <CODE>MySQL</CODE> development and also gain
immediate advantages for yourself. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.4.1  Support Offered by MySQL AB</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database software in a commercial context
such that you profit by its use, we ask that you further the development
of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software by purchasing some level of support.  We feel
that if the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database helps your business, it is reasonable to
ask that you help <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE>.
(Otherwise, if you ask us support questions, you are not only using
for free something into which we've put a lot a work, you're asking
us to provide free support, too.)

<H3><A NAME="MySQL_4.0_Nutshell" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_4.0_Nutshell">1.5.1  MySQL 4.0 in a Nutshell</A></H3>

<P>
Long promised by <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> and long awaited by our users,
MySQL Server 4.0 is now available in production version.

</P>
<P>
MySQL 4.0 is available for download from <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>
and from our mirrors. MySQL 4.0 has been tested by a large number of users
and is in production use at many large sites.

</P>
<P>
The major new features of MySQL Server 4.0 are geared toward our existing
business and community users, enhancing the MySQL database software
as the solution for mission-critical, heavy-load database systems.
Other new features target the users of embedded databases.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Version 4.0.12 was declared stable for production use in
March 2003. This means that, in future, only bug fixes will be done for 
the 4.0 release series and only critical bug fixes will be done for the
older 3.23 series.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-from-3.23">2.5.2  Upgrading From Version 3.23 to 4.0</A>.

</P>
<P>
New features to the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software are being added to MySQL 4.1
which is now also available (alpha version).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_4.1_Nutshell">1.5.2  MySQL 4.1 in a Nutshell</A>.

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL 4.0 has a query cache that can give a huge speed boost to
applications with repetitive queries. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache">6.9  MySQL Query Cache</A>.

<LI>

Version 4.0 further increases the speed of MySQL Server
in a number of areas, such as bulk <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s, searching on
packed indexes, creation of <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes, and <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT)</CODE>.
</UL>

<DT>Embedded MySQL Server introduced
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

The new Embedded Server library (instead of client/server) can easily 
be used in standalone and embedded applications.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Nutshell_Embedded_MySQL">1.5.1.2  Embedded MySQL Server</A>.
</UL>

<DT>InnoDB storage engine as standard
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> storage engine is now offered as a standard feature of the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> server. This means full support for ACID <EM>transactions</EM>,
<EM>foreign keys</EM> with cascading UPDATE/DELETE, and <EM>row-level locking</EM>
are now standard features.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>.
</UL>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

The enhanced <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> search properties of MySQL Server 4.0 enables
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexing of large text masses with both binary
and natural-language searching logic. You can customise minimal word
length and define your own stop word lists in any human language,
enabling a new set of applications to be built on MySQL Server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A>.
</UL>

<DT>Standards compliance, portability, and migration
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Features to simplify migration from other database systems to MySQL
Server include <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> (as in Oracle).

<LI>

Many users will also be happy to learn that MySQL Server now supports the
<CODE>UNION</CODE> statement, a long-awaited standard SQL feature.

<LI>

MySQL can now run natively on the Novell NetWare 6.0 platform.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Novell_NetWare">2.6.8  Novell NetWare Notes</A>.
</UL>

<DT>Internationalisation
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Our German, Austrian, and Swiss users will note that <CODE>MySQL</CODE> now
supports a new character set, <CODE>latin1_de</CODE>, which ensures that the 
<EM>German sorting order</EM> sorts words with umlauts in the same order 
as do German telephone books.
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>
In the process of building features for new users, we have not forgotten
requests from our community of loyal users.


<UL>
<LI>

Most <CODE>mysqld</CODE> parameters (startup options) can now be set without taking
down the servers. This is a convenient feature for Database Administrators (DBAs). 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements have been added..

<LI>

Support has been added for <CODE>symbolic linking</CODE> to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> at the table
level (and not just the database level as before) and for enabling
symlink handling by default on Windows.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> and <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> are new functions that make it
possible to find out the number of rows a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query that includes a
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause would have returned without that clause.
</UL>

</DL>

<P>
The news section of this manual includes a more in-depth list of features.

<H4><A NAME="Nutshell_Embedded_MySQL" HREF="manual_toc.html#Nutshell_Embedded_MySQL">1.5.1.2  Embedded MySQL Server</A></H4>

<P>
<CODE>libmysqld</CODE> makes MySQL Server suitable for a vastly expanded realm of
applications. Using the embedded MySQL server library, one can
embed MySQL Server into various applications and electronics devices, where
the end user has no knowledge of there actually being an underlying
database. Embedded MySQL Server is ideal for use behind
the scenes in Internet appliances, public kiosks, turnkey
hardware/software combination units, high performance Internet
servers, self-contained databases distributed on CD-ROM, and so on.

</P>
<P>
Many users of <CODE>libmysqld</CODE> will benefit from the MySQL
<EM>Dual Licensing</EM>. For those not wishing to be bound by the <CODE>GPL</CODE>,
the software is also made available under a commercial license.
The embedded MySQL library uses the same interface as the normal
client library, so it is convenient and easy to use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#libmysqld">11.1.15  libmysqld, the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="MySQL_4.1_Nutshell" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_4.1_Nutshell">1.5.2  MySQL 4.1 in a Nutshell</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL Server 4.0 laid the foundation for new features such as
<EM>nested subqueries</EM> and <EM>Unicode</EM> (implemented in version 4.1) 
and for the work on SQL-99 <EM>stored procedures</EM> being done for 
version 5.0. These features come at the top of the wish list of many 
of our customers.

</P>
<P>
With these additions, critics of the MySQL Database Server have to be
more imaginative than ever in pointing out deficiencies in the MySQL
Database Management System. Already well-known for its stability,
speed, and ease of use, MySQL Server will be able to fulfill the requirement
checklists of very demanding buyers.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Nutshell_4.1_features" HREF="manual_toc.html#Nutshell_4.1_features">1.5.2.1  Features Available in MySQL 4.1</A></H4>

<P>
The features listed in this section are implemented in MySQL 4.1. A few other
features are still planned for MySQL 4.1. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TODO_MySQL_4.1">1.8.1  New Features Planned For 4.1</A>.

</P>
<P>
Most new features being coded, such as <EM>stored procedures</EM>,
will be available in MySQL 5.0. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TODO_MySQL_5.0">1.8.2  New Features Planned For 5.0</A>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Support for subqueries and derived tables
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Subqueries are now supported. Here is an example:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a=(SELECT t2.b FROM t2);

SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (1,2,3) IN (SELECT a,b,c FROM t2);
</PRE>

<LI>

Derived tables (unnamed views) are now supported. Basically, a derived table
is a subquery in the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement. Here is 
an example:

<PRE>
SELECT t1.a FROM t1, (SELECT * FROM t2) t3 WHERE t1.a=t3.a;
</PRE>

</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Faster binary protocol with prepared statements and parameter binding.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_Prepared_statements">11.1.4  C API Prepared Statements</A>.
<LI>

<CODE>BTREE</CODE> indexing is now supported for <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables,
significantly improving response time for non-exact searches.
</UL>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE TABLE table LIKE table</CODE> allows you to create a new table
with the exact structure of an existing table, using a single command.
<LI>

Support for OpenGIS spatial types (geographical data).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Spatial_extensions_in_MySQL">10  Spatial Extensions in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Replication can be done over SSL connections.
</UL>

<DT>Standards compliance, portability, and migration
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

The new client/server protocol adds the ability to pass multiple
warnings to the client, rather than only a single result. This
makes jobs such as bulk loading of data much easier to track.
<CODE>SHOW WARNINGS</CODE> shows warnings for the last command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_WARNINGS">4.5.7.9  <CODE>SHOW WARNINGS | ERRORS</CODE></A>.
</UL>

<DT>Internationalisation
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

To support our ever expanding user base using local languages
in applications, the MySQL software now offers extensive
Unicode (UTF8) support.
<LI>

Character sets can now be defined per column, table, and database.
This allows for a high degree of flexibility in application design,
particularly for multi-language web sites.
<LI>

For documentation for this improved character set support,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Charset">9  National Character Sets and Unicode</A>.
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

In response to popular demand, we have added a server-based
<CODE>HELP command</CODE> that can be used in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line
client (and other clients) to get help for SQL commands.
The advantage of having this information on the server side is that the
information is always applicable for that particular server version.
<LI>

In the new client/server protocol, multi-line queries can now be enabled.
This allows you to issue several queries in a single call and then read
all the results in one go.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_multiple_queries">11.1.8  C API Handling of Multiple Query Execution</A>.
<LI>

A new <CODE>INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...</CODE> syntax has been
implemented. This allows you to <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> an existing row if the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> would have caused a duplicate in a <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key (index).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

We have designed a new aggregate function <CODE>GROUP_CONCAT()</CODE>,
adding the extremely useful capability of concatenating columns from
grouped rows into a single result string.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Group_by_functions">6.3.7  Functions and Modifiers for Use with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Clauses</A>.
<LI>

The new client/server protocol supports multiple result sets.
</UL>

New features are being added to MySQL 4.1, which is already available
for download (alpha version). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Nutshell_Ready_for_Immediate_Use">1.5.2.3  Ready for Immediate Development Use</A>.

</P>
<P>
The set of features that are being added to version 4.1 is mostly
fixed. Additional development is already ongoing for version 5.0.
MySQL 4.1 will go through the steps of
<EM>Alpha</EM> (during which time new features might still be added/changed),
<EM>Beta</EM> (when we have feature freeze and only bug corrections will be done),
and <EM>Gamma</EM> (indicating that a production release is just weeks ahead).
At the end of this process, MySQL 4.1 will become the new production release.

We try to keep the manual up to date by updating it frequently with
solutions to newly found problems. The change history appendix
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/News.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/News.html</a>) can be particularly
useful since it is quite possible that a newer version already
contains a solution to your problem.

Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest production or
development version of MySQL Server before posting.  Anyone should be
able to repeat the bug by just using '<CODE>mysql test &#60; script</CODE>' on the
included test case or run the shell or Perl script that is included in the
bug report.

</P>
<P>
All bugs posted in the bugs database at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>
will be corrected or documented in the
next MySQL release. If only minor code changes are needed to correct a
problem, we will also post a patch that fixes the problem.

</P>
<P>
The normal place to report bugs is <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you have found a sensitive security bug in MySQL, please send an
e-mail to <a HREF="mailto:security@mysql.com">security@mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you have a repeatable bug report, please report this into the bugs
database at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.  Note that even in this case
it's good to run the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script first to find information
about your system.  Any bug that we are able to repeat has a high chance
of being fixed in the next MySQL release.

</P>
<P>
To report other problems, you can use one of the MySQL mailing lists.

</P>
<P>
Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a message containing too much
information, but not to one containing too little.  People often omit facts
because they think they know the cause of a problem and assume that some
details don't matter.  A good principle is: if you are in doubt about stating
something, state it.  It is a thousand times faster and less troublesome to
write a couple of lines more in your report than to be forced to ask again
and wait for the answer because you didn't include enough information the
first time.

</P>
<P>
The most common errors made in bug reports are (a) not including the version number of
the MySQL distribution used and (b) not fully describing the platform on which the MySQL server
is installed (including the platform type and version number).  This is highly
relevant information, and in 99 cases out of 100 the bug report is useless without it.  
Very often we get questions like,
``Why doesn't this work for me?'' Then we find that the feature
requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug
described in a report has already been fixed in newer MySQL
versions.  Sometimes the error is platform-dependent; in such cases, it is
next to impossible for us to fix anything without knowing the operating system and
the version number of the platform.

</P>
<P>
Remember also to provide information about your compiler, if it is related to
the problem.  Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is
MySQL-related.  Most compilers are under development all the time and
become better version by version.  To determine whether your
problem depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler you use.
Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug and
reported accordingly.

</P>
<P>
It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is included in the
bug report.  That is, give a good example of all the things you did that led to
the problem and describe, in exact detail, the problem itself.  The best reports are
those that include a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or
problem.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case If You Experience Table Corruption</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a program produces an error message, it is very important to include the
message in your report.  If we try to search for something from the archives
using programs, it is better that the error message reported exactly matches
the one that the program produces.  (Even the case should be observed.)
You should never try to remember what the error message was; instead, copy
and paste the entire message into your report.

</P>
<P>
If you have a problem with MyODBC, please try to generate a MyODBC
trace file and send it with your report.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyODBC_bug_report">11.2.7  Reporting Problems with MyODBC</A>.

</P>
<P>
Please remember that many of the people who will read your report will
do so using an 80-column display.  When generating reports or examples
using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tool, you should therefore use
the <CODE>--vertical</CODE> option (or the <CODE>\G</CODE> statement terminator)
for output that would exceed the available width for such a display
(for example, with the <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> statement; see the
example later in this section).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
Please include the following information in your report:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for
example, MySQL Version 4.0.12). You can find out which version you
are running by executing <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE>.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can be
found in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

<LI>

The manufacturer and model of the machine on which you experience the 
problem.

<LI>

The operating system name and version.  For most operating systems, you can
get this information by executing the Unix command <CODE>uname -a</CODE>.  If 
you work with Windows, you can usually get the name and version number 
by double-clicking your ''My Computer'' icon and pulling down the ''Help/About Windows'' 
menu.

<LI>

Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant. If in doubt,
include these values.

<LI>

If you are using a source distribution of the MySQL software, the name and
version number of the compiler used is needed.  If you have a binary
distribution, the distribution name is needed.

<LI>

If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact error
message(s) and also a few lines of context around the offending code in the
file where the error occurrs.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died, you should also report the query that crashed
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  You can usually find this out by running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
logging enabled.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_log_files">E.1.5  Using Log Files to Find Cause of Errors in mysqld</A>.

<LI>

If a database table is related to the problem, include the output from
<CODE>mysqldump --no-data db_name tbl_name1 tbl_name2 ...</CODE>.  This is very easy
to do and is a powerful way to get information about any table in a database.
The information will help us create a situation matching the one you have.

<LI>

For speed-related bugs or problems with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, you
should always include the output of <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE>, and at
least the number of rows that the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement produces.  You
should also include the output from <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl_name</CODE>
for each involved table. The more information you give about your
situation, the more likely it is that someone can help you.  The following 
is an example of a very good bug report (it
should of course be posted with the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script).

Example run using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tool (note the use of the
<CODE>\G</CODE> statement terminator for statements whose output width would
otherwise exceed that of an 80-column display device):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW VARIABLES;
mysql&#62; SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G
       &#60;output from SHOW COLUMNS&#62;
mysql&#62; EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G
       &#60;output from EXPLAIN&#62;
mysql&#62; FLUSH STATUS;
mysql&#62; SELECT ...;
       &#60;A short version of the output from SELECT,
       including the time taken to run the query&#62;
mysql&#62; SHOW STATUS;
       &#60;output from SHOW STATUS&#62;
</PRE>

<LI>

If a bug or problem occurs while running <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, try to provide an
input script that will reproduce the anomaly.  This script should include any
necessary source files.  The more closely the script can reproduce your
situation, the better.  If you can make a reproducible test case, you should
post it on <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a> for high-priority treatment.

If you can't provide a script, you should at least include the output
from <CODE>mysqladmin variables extended-status processlist</CODE> in your mail to
provide some information on how your system is performing.

<LI>

If you can't produce a test case with only a few rows, or if the test table
is too big to be mailed to the mailing list (more than 10 rows), you should
dump your tables using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and create a <TT>`README'</TT> file
that describes your problem.

Create a compressed archive of your files using
<CODE>tar</CODE> and <CODE>gzip</CODE> or <CODE>zip</CODE>, and use <CODE>ftp</CODE> to transfer the
archive to <a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  Then enter
the problem into our bugs database at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.

<LI>

If you think that the MySQL server produces a strange result from a query,
include not only the result, but also your opinion of what the result
should be, and an account describing the basis for your opinion.

<LI>

When giving an example of the problem, it's better to use the variable names,
table names, etc., that exist in your actual situation than to come up with
new names.  The problem could be related to the name of a variable or table.
These cases are rare, perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry.
After all, it should be easier for you to provide an example that uses your
actual situation, and it is by all means better for us.  In case you have data
you don't want to show to others, you can use <CODE>ftp</CODE> to transfer it to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  If the data is really top
secret and you don't want to show it even to us, then go ahead and provide
an example using other names, but please regard this as the last choice.

<LI>

Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if possible.  For
example, indicate the options that you use when you start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
daemon as well as the options that you use to run any MySQL client programs.
The options to programs like <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and <CODE>mysql</CODE>, and to the
<CODE>configure</CODE> script, are often keys to answers and are very relevant.
It is never a bad idea to include them.  If you use any modules, such
as Perl or PHP, please include the version number(s) of those as well.

<LI>

If your question is related to the privilege system, please include the
output of <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>, the output of <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>, and all
the error messages you get when trying to connect.  When you test your
privileges, you should first run <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.  After this, execute
<CODE>mysqladmin reload version</CODE> and try to connect with the program that
gives you trouble.  <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`bin'</TT>
directory under your MySQL installation directory.

<LI>

If you have a patch for a bug, do include it.  But don't assume the patch is
all we need, or that we will use it, if you don't provide some necessary
information such as test cases showing the bug that your patch fixes.  We
might find problems with your patch or we might not understand it at all; if
so, we can't use it.

If we can't verify exactly what the patch is meant for, we won't use it.
Test cases will help us here.  Show that the patch will handle all the
situations that may occur.  If we find a borderline case (even a rare one)
where the patch won't work, it may be useless.

<LI>

Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends on
are usually wrong.  Even the MySQL team can't guess such things
without first using a debugger to determine the real cause of a bug.

<LI>

Indicate in your bug report that you have checked the reference manual
and mail archive so that others know you have tried to solve the
problem yourself.

<LI>

If you get a <CODE>parse error</CODE>, please check your syntax closely.  If
you can't find something wrong with it, it's extremely likely that your
current version of MySQL Server doesn't support the syntax you are
using.  If you are using the current version and the manual at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/">http://www.mysql.com/doc/</a> doesn't cover the
syntax you are using, MySQL Server doesn't support your query.  In this
case, your only options are to implement the syntax yourself or e-mail
<a HREF="mailto:licensing@mysql.com">licensing@mysql.com</a> and ask for an offer to implement it.

If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an older version
of MySQL Server, you should check the MySQL change history to see
when the syntax was implemented.  In this case, you have the option of
upgrading to a newer version of MySQL Server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>.

<LI>

If your problem is that your data appears corrupt or you get
errors when you access a particular table, you should first check and then
try repairing your tables with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> or <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

If you often get corrupted tables you should try to find out when and why this
happens.  In this case, the <TT>`mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'</TT> file
may contain some information about what happened.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.  Please
include any relevant information from this file in your bug report.  Normally
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> should <STRONG>never</STRONG> crash a table if nothing killed it in the
middle of an update.  If you can find the cause of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dying,
it's much easier for us to provide you with a fix for the problem.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#What_is_crashing">A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems</A>.

<LI>

If possible, download and install the most recent version of MySQL Server
and check whether it solves your problem.  All versions of
the MySQL software are thoroughly tested and should work without problems.
We believe in making everything as backward-compatible as possible,
and you should be able to switch MySQL versions without difficulty.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_version">2.2.6  Which MySQL Version to Use</A>.

This section describes how MySQL relates to the ANSI/ISO SQL standards.
MySQL Server has many extensions to the SQL standard, and here you
will find out what they are and how to use them.  You will also find
information about functionality missing from MySQL Server, and how to work
around some differences.

</P>
<P>
Our goal is to not, without a very good reason, restrict MySQL Server usability
for any usage.  Even if we don't have the resources to do development
for every possible use, we are always willing to help and offer
suggestions to people who are trying to use MySQL Server in new territories.

</P>
<P>
One of our main goals with the product is to continue to work toward
compliance with the SQL-99 standard, but without sacrificing speed or reliability.
We are not afraid to add extensions to SQL or support for non-SQL
features if this greatly increases the usability of MySQL Server for a big
part of our users.  (The new <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> interface in MySQL Server 4.0
is an example of this strategy. See section <A HREF="manual.html#HANDLER">6.4.2  <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> Syntax</A>.)

</P>
<P>
We will continue to support transactional and non-transactional
databases to satisfy both heavy web/logging usage and mission-critical
24/7 usage.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Server was designed from the start to work with medium size databases
(10-100 million rows, or about 100 MB per table) on small computer
systems.  We will continue to extend MySQL Server to work even better
with terabyte-size databases, as well as to make it possible
to compile a reduced MySQL version that is more suitable for hand-held
devices and embedded usage.  The compact design of the MySQL server makes both
of these directions possible without any conflicts in the source tree.

</P>
<P>
We are currently not targeting realtime support or clustered databases
(even if you can already do a lot of things with our replication
services).

</P>
<P>
We are looking at providing XML support in the database server.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Standards" HREF="manual_toc.html#Standards">1.7.1  What Standards Does MySQL Follow?</A></H3>

<P>
Entry-level SQL-92. ODBC levels 0-3.51.

</P>
<P>
We are aiming toward supporting the full SQL-99 standard,
but without concessions to speed and quality of the code.

<H3><A NAME="ANSI_mode" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--ansi</CODE> or <CODE>--sql-mode=ANSI</CODE>
option, the following behaviours of MySQL Server change:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>||</CODE> is a string concatenation operator rather than a synonym for
<CODE>OR</CODE>.

<LI>

<SAMP>`"'</SAMP> is treated as an identifier quote character (like the MySQL Server
<SAMP>``'</SAMP> quote character) and not as a string quote character. You can still
use <SAMP>``'</SAMP> to quote identifers in ANSI mode. An implication of this is that
you cannot use double quotes to quote a literal string, because it will be
intepreted as an identifier.

<LI>

You can have any number of spaces between a function name and the
<SAMP>`('</SAMP> character.  This forces all function names to be treated
as reserved words. As a result, if you want to access any database,
table, or column name that is a reserved word, you must quote it.
For example, because there is a <CODE>USER()</CODE> function,
the name of the <CODE>user</CODE> table in the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database and the <CODE>User</CODE> column in that table become reserved,
so you must quote them:


<PRE>
SELECT "User" FROM mysql."user";
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>REAL</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> instead of a synonym for
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.

<LI>

The default transaction isolation level is <CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_TRANSACTION">6.7.6  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can use a field/expression in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> that is not in the
field list.
</UL>

<P>
Running the server in ANSI mode is the same as starting it with these options:

</P>

<PRE>
--sql-mode=REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL 4.1, you can achieve the same effect with these two statements:

</P>

<PRE>
SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SET GLOBAL sql_mode =
  "REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY";
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL 4.1.1, the <CODE>sql_mode</CODE> options shown can be also be set with:

</P>

<PRE>
SET GLOBAL sql_mode="ansi";
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the value of the <CODE>sql_mode</CODE> variable will be set to all
options that are relevant for ANSI mode. You can check the result by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET GLOBAL sql_mode="ansi";
mysql&#62; SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;
         -&#62; "REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,ANSI"
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="Extensions_to_ANSI" HREF="manual_toc.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">1.7.3  MySQL Extensions to the SQL-92 Standard</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
MySQL Server includes some extensions that you probably will not find in
other SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be
portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that
includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using comments
of the form <CODE>/*! ... */</CODE>.  In this case, MySQL Server will parse and
execute the code within the comment as it would any other MySQL
statement, but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
</PRE>

<P>
If you add a version number after the <CODE>'!'</CODE>, the syntax will be
executed only if the MySQL version is equal to or newer than the used
version number:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE t (a INT);
</PRE>

<P>
This means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, MySQL
Server will use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword.

</P>
<P>
The following is a list of MySQL extensions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The field types <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, <CODE>SET</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, and the
different <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types.

<LI>

The field attributes <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, and <CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>.

<LI>

All string comparisons are case-insensitive by default, with sort
ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by
default).  If you don't like this, you should declare your columns with
the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute or use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast, which causes
comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the
MySQL server host.

<LI>

MySQL Server maps each database to a directory under the MySQL
data directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the database
directory.

This has a few implications:

<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>


<UL>

<LI>

Database names and table names are case-sensitive in MySQL Server on
operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like most Unix
systems). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<LI>

Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with a digit
(but may not consist solely of digits).

<LI>

You can use standard system commands to back up, rename, move, delete, and copy
tables.  For example, to rename a table, rename the <TT>`.MYD'</TT>, <TT>`.MYI'</TT>,
and <TT>`.frm'</TT> files to which the table corresponds.
</UL>

<LI>

In SQL statements, you can access tables from different databases
with the <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> syntax.  Some SQL servers provide
the same functionality but call this <CODE>User space</CODE>.
MySQL Server doesn't support tablespaces as in:
<CODE>create table ralph.my_table...IN my_tablespace</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is allowed on numeric columns.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE> and <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE> option in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

<LI>

<CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> to get a description of how tables are joined.

<LI>

Use of index names, indexes on a prefix of a field, and use of
<CODE>INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>KEY</CODE> in a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> or <CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT list)</CODE> where <CODE>list</CODE> has more than one element.

To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments,
MySQL Server supports aliases for many functions. For example, all
string functions support both standard SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.

<LI>

MySQL Server understands the <CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> operators to mean
logical OR and AND, as in the C programming language.  In MySQL Server,
<CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>OR</CODE> are synonyms, as are <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> and <CODE>AND</CODE>.
Because of this nice syntax, MySQL Server doesn't support
the standard SQL-99 <CODE>||</CODE> operator for string concatenation; use
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> instead. Because <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> takes any number
of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the <CODE>||</CODE> operator to
MySQL Server.

<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<LI>

The <CODE>%</CODE> operator is a synonym for <CODE>MOD()</CODE>.  That is,
<CODE>N % M</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>MOD(N,M)</CODE>.  <CODE>%</CODE> is supported
for C programmers and for compatibility with PostgreSQL.

</P>

<UL>

For <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, trailing spaces are removed when the value is
stored. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.7.6  Known Errors and Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.

Privileges for a table are not automatically revoked when you delete a

<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_Subqueries" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_Subqueries">1.7.4.1  Subqueries</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>

</P>
<P>
Subqueries are supported in MySQL version 4.1.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Nutshell_4.1_features">1.5.2.1  Features Available in MySQL 4.1</A>.

</P>
<P>
Up to version 4.0, only nested queries of the form
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ...</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE ... SELECT ...</CODE>
are supported.
You can, however, use the function <CODE>IN()</CODE> in other contexts.

</P>
<P>
You can often rewrite the query without a subquery:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
</PRE>

<P>
This can be rewritten as:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
The queries:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table2
                                       WHERE table1.id=table2.id);
</PRE>

<P>
Can be rewritten as:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
                                       WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
Using a <CODE>LEFT [OUTER] JOIN</CODE> is generally much faster than an
equivalent subquery because the server can optimise it better,
a fact that is not specific to MySQL Server alone. 
Prior to SQL-92, outer joins did not exist, so subqueries were the
only way to do certain things in those bygone days. But that is no
longer the case, MySQL Server and many other modern database
systems offer a whole range of outer joins types.

</P>
<P>
For more complicated subqueries you can often create temporary tables
to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however, this option will not
work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins
(except in subqueries).  For this situation there are three options
available:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first option is to upgrade to MySQL version 4.1.

<LI>

The second option is to use a procedural programming language (such as
Perl or PHP) to submit a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query to obtain the primary keys
for the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement (<CODE>DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... IN (key1,
key2, ...)</CODE>).

<LI>

The third option is to use interactive SQL to construct a set of
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements automatically, using the MySQL
extension <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> (in lieu of the standard <CODE>||</CODE> operator).
For example:


<PRE>
SELECT CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', "'", tab1.pkid, "'", ';')
  FROM tab1, tab2
 WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;
</PRE>

You can place this query in a script file and redirect input from it to
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line interpreter, piping its output back to a
second instance of the interpreter:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --skip-column-names mydb &#60; myscript.sql | mysql mydb
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
MySQL Server 4.0 supports multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE>s that can be used to
efficiently delete rows based on information from one table or even
from many tables at the same time.

<P>
MySQL Server doesn't yet support the Oracle SQL extension:
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO TABLE ...</CODE>.  Instead, MySQL Server supports the
SQL-99 syntax <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</CODE>, which is basically
the same thing. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_SELECT">6.4.3.1  <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID) SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID

MySQL Server (version 3.23-max and all versions 4.0 and above) supports
transactions with the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE>
<CODE>Transactional storage engines</CODE>.
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> provides <EM>full</EM> <CODE>ACID</CODE> compliance.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
The other non-transactional table types (such as <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>) in
MySQL Server follow a different paradigm for data integrity called
``<CODE>Atomic Operations</CODE>.'' In transactional terms, <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables effectively always operate in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT=1</CODE> mode.
Atomic operations often offer comparable integrity with higher performance.

</P>
<P>
With MySQL Server supporting both paradigms, the user is able to decide if
he needs the speed of atomic operations or if he needs to use
transactional features in his applications. This choice can be made
on a per-table basis.

</P>
<P>
As noted, the trade off for transactional vs. non-transactional table
types lies mostly in performance. Transactional tables have significantly
higher memory and diskspace requirements, and more CPU overhead.
That said, transactional table types such as <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> do of course
offer many unique features. MySQL Server's modular design allows the
concurrent use of all these different storage engines to suit different
requirements and deliver optimum performance in all situations.

</P>
<P>
But how does one use the features of MySQL Server to maintain rigorous
integrity even with the non-transactional <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, and how
do these features compare with the transactional table types?

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

In the transactional paradigm, if your applications are written in a
way that is dependent on the calling of <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> instead of
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> in critical situations, transactions are more
convenient. Transactions also ensure that unfinished updates or
corrupting activities are not committed to the database; the server is
given the opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is
saved.

MySQL Server, in almost all cases, allows you to resolve potential problems
by including simple checks before updates and by running simple scripts
that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically repair
or warn if such an inconsistency occurs. Note that just by using the
MySQL log or even adding one extra log, one can normally fix tables
perfectly with no data integrity loss.

<LI>

More often than not, critical transactional updates can be rewritten to be
atomic. Generally speaking, all integrity problems that transactions
solve can be done with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or atomic updates, ensuring
that you never will get an automatic abort from the server, which is
a common problem with transactional database systems.

<LI>

Even a transactional system can lose data if the server goes down.
The difference between different systems lies in just how small the
time-lap is where they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only
``secure enough.'' Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of
transactional database systems, is reported to sometimes lose data in such
situations.

To be safe with MySQL Server, whether using transactional tables or not, you
only need to have backups and have the binary logging turned on. With
this you can recover from any situation that you could with any
other transactional database system.  It is, of course, always good to have
backups, independent of which database system you use.
</OL>

<P>
The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many
users and application developers depend on the ease with which they
can code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary.
However, even if you are new to the atomic operations paradigm, or more
familiar with transactions, do consider the speed benefit that
non-transactional tables can offer on the order of three to five times
the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned transactional tables.

</P>
<P>
In situations where integrity is of highest importance, MySQL Server offers
transaction-level reliability and integrity even for non-transactional tables.
If you lock tables with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, all updates will stall
until any integrity checks are made. If you only obtain a read lock
(as opposed to a write lock), reads and inserts are still allowed
to happen. The new inserted records will not be seen by any of the
clients that have a read lock until they release their read
locks. With <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> you can queue inserts into a local
queue, until the locks are released, without having the client wait
for the insert to complete. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_DELAYED">6.4.3.2  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
``Atomic,'' in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only
means that you can be sure that while each specific update is running,
no other user can interfere with it, and there will never be an
automatic rollback (which can happen with transactional tables if you
are not very careful).  MySQL Server also guarantees that there will not be
any dirty reads.

</P>
<P>
Following are some techniques for working with non-transactional tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, and you don't need cursors when you can update
records on the fly.

<LI>

To avoid using <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, you can use the following strategy:


<OL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOCK TABLES ...</CODE> to lock all the tables you want to access.
<LI>

Test conditions.
<LI>

Update if everything is okay.
<LI>

Use <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> to release your locks.
</OL>

This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with
possible <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>s, although not always. The only situation
this solution doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the
middle of an update. In this case, all locks will be released but some
of the updates may not have been executed.

<LI>

You can also use functions to update records in a single operation.
You can get a very efficient application by using the following
techniques:


<UL>
<LI>Modify fields relative to their current value.

<LI>Update only those fields that actually have changed.

</UL>

For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we
update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none of
the changed data, or data that depends on the changed data, has changed
compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done with the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement. If the record wasn't
updated, we give the client a message: ''Some of the data you have changed
has been changed by another user.'' Then we show the old row versus the new
row in a window, so the user can decide which version of the customer record
he should use.

This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is actually
even better because we only update some of the columns, using values that
are relative to their current values.  This means that typical <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements look something like these:


<PRE>
UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+125;

UPDATE customer
  SET
    customer_date='current_date',
    address='new address',
    phone='new phone',
    money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us-125
  WHERE
    customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';
</PRE>

As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client
has changed the values in the <CODE>pay_back</CODE> or <CODE>money_he_owes_us</CODE>
columns.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
In many cases, users have wanted <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> and/or <CODE>LOCK
TABLES</CODE> for the purpose of managing unique identifiers for some tables.
This can be handled much more efficiently by using an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column and either the SQL function
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> or the C API function <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">11.1.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
You can generally code around row-level locking. Some situations really
need it, but they are very few. <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support row-level
locking. With MyISAM, you can use a flag column in the table and do
something like the following:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;
</PRE>

MySQL returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was
found and <CODE>row_flag</CODE> wasn't already 1 in the original row.

You can think of it as though MySQL Server changed the preceding query to:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID AND row_flag &#60;&#62; 1;
</PRE>

<P>
Stored procedures are being implemented in our version 5.0 development tree.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source_tree">2.3.4  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.

</P>
<P>
This effort is based on SQL-99, which has a basic syntax
similar (but not identical) to Oracle PL/SQL. In addition to this, we are
implementing the SQL-99 framework to hook in external languages.

</P>
<P>
A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and stored
in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep re-issuing
the entire query but can refer to the stored procedure. This provides better
overall performance because the query has to be parsed only once, and less
information needs to be sent between the server and the client. You can also
raise the conceptual level by having libraries of functions in the server.
However, stored procedures of course do increase the load on the database
server system, as more of the work is done on the server side and less on
the client (application) side.

</P>
<P>
Triggers will also be implemented. A trigger is effectively a type of
stored procedure, one that is invoked when a particular event occurs.
For example, you can install a stored procedure that is triggered
each time a record is deleted from a transactional table and that stored
procedure automatically deletes the corresponding customer from a customer
table when all his transactions are deleted.

<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Server 3.23.44 and up, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support checking of
foreign key constraints, including <CODE>CASCADE</CODE>, <CODE>ON DELETE</CODE>, and
<CODE>ON UPDATE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints">7.5.5.2  <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> Constraints</A>.

</P>
<P>
For other table types, MySQL Server only parses the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>
syntax in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> commands, but does not use/store this info.

</P>
<P>
Note that foreign keys in SQL are not used to join tables, but are used
mostly for checking referential integrity (foreign key constraints).  If
you want to get results from multiple tables from a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement, you do this by joining tables:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id = table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#example-Foreign_keys">3.6.6  Using Foreign Keys</A>.

</P>
<P>
When used as a constraint, <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>s don't need to be used if
the application inserts rows into <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables in the proper order.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, you can work around the lack of <CODE>ON DELETE</CODE>
by adding the appropriate <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement to an application when you
delete records from a table that has a foreign key. In practice this is as
quick (in some cases quicker) and much more portable than using foreign keys.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Server 4.0 you can use multi-table delete to delete rows from many
tables with one command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DELETE">6.4.5  <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax without <CODE>ON DELETE ...</CODE> is often used
by ODBC applications to produce automatic <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses.

</P>
<P>
In the near future we will extend the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> implementation
so that the information is stored in the table specification file
and may be retrieved by <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and ODBC. At a later stage we
will implement foreign key constraints for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as well.

</P>
<P>
Do keep in mind that foreign keys are often misused, which can cause
severe problems. Even when used properly, it is not a magic solution for
the referential integrity problem, although it can make things easier.

</P>
<P>
Some advantages of foreign key enforcement:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Assuming proper design of the relations, foreign key constraints will
make it more difficult for a programmer to introduce an inconsistency
into the database.

<LI>

Using cascading updates and deletes can simplify the client code.

<LI>

Properly designed foreign key rules aid in documenting relations
between tables.
</UL>

<P>
Disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mistakes, which are easy to make in designing key relations, can cause
severe problems--for example, circular rules, or the wrong combination
of cascading deletes.

<LI>

Additional checking on the database level affects performance, for this
reason some major commercial applications have coded this logic on the
application level.

<LI>

It is not uncommon for a DBA to make such a complex topology of
relations that it becomes very difficult, and in some cases impossible,
to back up or restore individual tables.

</P>
<P>
We plan to implement views in MySQL Server in version 5.1

</P>
<P>
Historically, MySQL Server has been most used in applications and on web
systems where the application writer has full control over database
usage. Of course, usage has shifted over time, and so we find that an
increasing number of users now regard views as an important aspect.

</P>
<P>
Views are useful for allowing users to access a set of relations as if
it were a single table, and limiting their access to just that.
Many DBMS don't allow updates to a view, instead you have to perform the
updates on the individual tables.

</P>
<P>
Views can also be used to restrict access to rows (a subset of a
particular table).
One does not need views to restrict access to columns, as MySQL Server
has a sophisticated privilege system.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_system">4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

</P>
<P>
In designing our implementation of views, we aim toward (as fully as
possible within the confines of SQL) compliance with
``<STRONG>Codd's Rule #6</STRONG>'' for relational database systems: all views
that are theoretically updatable, should in practice also be updatable.
This is a complex issue, and we are taking the time to make sure we get
it right.

</P>
<P>
The implementation itself will be done in stages.
Unnamed views (<EM>derived tables</EM>, a subquery in the <CODE>FROM</CODE>
clause of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>) are already implemented in version 4.1.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If you are an enterprise level user with an urgent need
for views, please contact <a HREF="mailto:sales@mysql.com">sales@mysql.com</a> to discuss sponsoring
options. Targeted financing of this particular effort by one or more
companies would allow us to allocate additional resources to it.
One example of a feature sponsored in the past is replication.

<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_comments" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_comments">1.7.4.7  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some other SQL databases use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> to start comments.
MySQL Server has <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as the start comment character. You can also use
the C comment style <CODE>/* this is a comment */</CODE> with MySQL Server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Comments">6.1.6  Comment Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Server Version 3.23.3 and above support the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> comment style,
provided the comment is followed by a space (or by a control character such
as a newline).  This is because this
comment style has caused many problems with automatically generated
SQL queries that have used something like the following code, where
we automatically insert the value of the payment for
<CODE>!payment!</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!
</PRE>

<P>
Think about what happens if the value of <CODE>payment</CODE> is negative.
Because <CODE>1--1</CODE> is legal in SQL, the consequences of allowing
comments to start with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> are terrible.

</P>
<P>
Using our implementation of this method of commenting in MySQL Server
Version 3.23.3 and up, <CODE>1-- This is a comment</CODE> is actually safe.

</P>
<P>
Another safe feature is that the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line client
removes all lines that start with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.

</P>

<P>
The following information is relevant only if you are running a
MySQL version earlier than 3.23.3:

</P>
<P>
If you have an SQL program in a text file that contains <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>
comments you should use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \
         | mysql database
</PRE>

<P>
instead of the usual:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

<P>
You can also edit the command file ``in place'' to change the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>
comments to <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> comments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

<P>
Change them back with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " #" " --" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="Constraints" HREF="manual_toc.html#Constraints">1.7.5  How MySQL deals with constraints</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>

</P>
<P>
As MySQL allows you to work with both transactional and
non-transactional tables (which don't allow rollback), constraint handling is
a bit different in MySQL than in other databases.

</P>
<P>
We have to handle the case when you have updated a lot of rows with a
non-transactional table which can't rollback on errors.

</P>
<P>
The basic philosophy is to try to give an error for anything that we can
detect on compile time but try to recover from any errors we get run time.
We do this in most cases, but not yet for all. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TODO_future">1.8.4  New Features Planned for the Near Future</A>.

</P>
<P>
The basic options MySQL has is to stop the statement in the middle or do
it's best to recover from the problem and continue.

</P>
<P>
Here follows what happens with the different types of constraints.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="constraint_primary_key" HREF="manual_toc.html#constraint_primary_key">1.7.5.1  Constraint PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>

</P>
<P>
Normally you will get an error when you try to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> /
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> a row that causes a primary key, unique key or foreign key
violation.  If you are using a transactional storage engine, like
InnoDB, MySQL will automatically roll back the transaction.  If you are
using a non-transactional storage engine MySQL will stop at the wrong
row and leave the rest of the rows unprocessed.

</P>
<P>
To make life easier MySQL has added support for the <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>
directive to most commands that can cause a key violation (like
<CODE>INSERT IGNORE ...</CODE>). In this case MySQL will ignore any key
violation and continue with processing the next row.  You can get
information of what MySQL did with the <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> API function
and in later MySQL 4.1 version with the <CODE>SHOW WARNINGS</CODE>
command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_info">11.1.3.122  <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE></A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_WARNINGS">4.5.7.9  <CODE>SHOW WARNINGS | ERRORS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that for the moment only <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support foreign keys.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints">7.5.5.2  <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> Constraints</A>.
Foreign key support in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables is scheduled for inclusion
in the MySQL 5.0 source tree.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="constraint_NOT_NULL" HREF="manual_toc.html#constraint_NOT_NULL">1.7.5.2  Constraint <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> and <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>

</P>
<P>
To be able to support easy handling of non-transactional tables all
fields in MySQL have default values. 

</P>
<P>
If you insert a 'wrong' value in a column like a <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> column or a too big numerical value in a numerical
column, MySQL will instead of giving an error instead set the column to
the 'best possible value'.  For numerical values this is 0, the smallest
possible values or the largest possible value. For strings this is
either the empty string or the longest possible string that can be in
the column.

</P>
<P>
This means that if you try to store <CODE>NULL</CODE> into a column that
doesn't take <CODE>NULL</CODE> values, MySQL Server will store 0 or <CODE>''</CODE>
(empty string) in it instead. This last behaviour can, for single row
inserts, be changed with the <CODE>-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS</CODE> compile
option.) See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.
This causes <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to generate an error unless you
explicitly specify values for all columns that require a non-<CODE>NULL</CODE>
value.

</P>
<P>
The reason for the above rules is that we can't check these conditions
before the query starts to execute.  If we encounter a problem after
updating a few rows, we can't just rollback as the table type may not
support this.  The option to stop is not that good as in this case the
update would be 'half done' which is probably the worst possible
scenario.  In this case it's better to 'do the best you can' and then
continue as if nothing happened.  In MySQL 5.0 we plan to improve this
by providing warnings for automatic field conversions, plus an
option to let you roll back statements that only use transactional
tables in case one such statement does a field assignment that is not
allowed.

</P>
<P>
The above means that one should generally not use MySQL to check field
content, but instead handle this in the application.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="constraint_enum" HREF="manual_toc.html#constraint_enum">1.7.5.3  Constraint <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
In MySQL 4.x <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is not a real constrain but a more efficient
way to store fields that can only contain a given set of values.
This is because of the same reasons <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> is not honoured.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#constraint_NOT_NULL">1.7.5.2  Constraint <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> and <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you insert an wrong value in an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> field, it will be set to
the reserved enum number <CODE>0</CODE>, which will be displayed as an empty
string in string context. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you insert an wrong option in a <CODE>SET</CODE> field, the wrong value
will be ignored. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET">6.2.3.4  The <CODE>SET</CODE> Type</A>.

<H4><A NAME="Errors_in_3.23" HREF="manual_toc.html#Errors_in_3.23">1.7.6.1  Errors in 3.23 Fixed in a Later MySQL Version</A></H4>

<P>
The following known errors/bugs are not fixed in MySQL 3.23 because fixing
them would involves changing a lot of code which could introduce other
even worse bugs. The bugs are also classified as 'not fatal' or
'bearable'.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

One can get a deadlock when doing <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> on multiple tables
and then in the same connection doing a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on one of
them while another thread is trying to lock the table.  One can however
do a <CODE>KILL</CODE> on any of the involved threads to resolve this.
Fixed in 4.0.12.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT MAX(key_column) FROM t1,t2,t3...</CODE> where one of the tables are
empty doesn't return <CODE>NULL</CODE> but instead the maximum value for the
column.  Fixed in 4.0.11.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM heap_table</CODE> without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> doesn't work on a locked
HEAP table.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Open_bugs" HREF="manual_toc.html#Open_bugs">1.7.6.2  Open Bugs / Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A></H4>

<P>
The following problems are known and fixing them is a high priority:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE> does not block <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> or
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, which make cause a problem with the binary log position when
doing a full backup of tables and the binary log.

<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> on a BDB table may in some cases make the table
unusable until one has restarted <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  When this happens you will
see errors like the following in the MySQL error file:


<PRE>
001207 22:07:56  bdb:  log_flush: LSN past current end-of-log
</PRE>

<LI>

MySQL accepts parentheses in the <CODE>FROM</CODE> part, but silently
ignores them.  The reason for not giving an error is that many clients
that automatically generate queries add parentheses in the <CODE>FROM</CODE>
part even where they are not needed.

<LI>

Concatenating many <CODE>RIGHT JOINS</CODE> or combining <CODE>LEFT</CODE> and
<CODE>RIGHT</CODE> join in the same query may not give a correct answer as
MySQL only generates <CODE>NULL</CODE> rows for the table preceding a <CODE>LEFT</CODE> or
before a <CODE>RIGHT</CODE> join.  This will be fixed in 5.0 at the same time
we add support for parentheses in the <CODE>FROM</CODE> part.

<LI>

Don't execute <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table on which you are
running multi-statement transactions until all those transactions complete.
(The transaction will probably be ignored.)

<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, and <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> may
cause problems on tables for which you are using <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.

<LI>

Doing a <CODE>LOCK TABLE ...</CODE> and <CODE>FLUSH TABLES ...</CODE> doesn't
guarantee that there isn't a half-finished transaction in progress on the
table.

<LI>

BDB tables are a bit slow to open. If you have many BDB tables in a
database, it will take a long time to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client on the
database if you are not using the <CODE>-A</CODE> option or if you are using
<CODE>rehash</CODE>. This is especially notable when you have a big table
cache.

<LI>

Replication uses query-level logging: the master writes the executed
queries to the binary log. This is a very fast, compact, and efficient
logging method that works perfectly in most cases.
Though we have never heard of it actually occurring, it is theoretically
possible for the data on the master and slave to become different if a
query is designed in such a way that the data modification is
non-deterministic, that is, left to the will of the query optimiser (which
generally is not a good practice, even outside of replication!).
For example: 


<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE> or
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> which
feeds zeros or <CODE>NULL</CODE>s into an <CODE>auto_increment</CODE> column.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE> if you are
deleting rows from a table which has foreign keys with <CODE>ON DELETE
CASCADE</CODE> properties.
<LI>

<CODE>REPLACE ... SELECT</CODE>, 
<CODE>INSERT IGNORE ... SELECT</CODE> if you have
duplicate key values in the inserted data.
</UL>

<STRONG>IF and only if all these queries have NO <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
clause guaranteeing a deterministic order</STRONG>.

Indeed, for example for <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> with no <CODE>ORDER
BY</CODE>, the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> may return rows in a different order
(which will result in a row having different ranks, hence getting a
different number in the <CODE>auto_increment</CODE> column),
depending on the choices made by the optimisers on the master and
slave. A query will be optimised differently on the master and slave only if:


<UL>
<LI>

The files used by the two queries are not exactly the same; for
example <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> was run on the master tables and not on
the slave tables (to fix this, since MySQL 4.1.1, <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>
and <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> are written to the binary log).
<LI>

The table is stored in a different storage engine on the master than
on the slave (one can run with different storage engines on the slave
and master: for example InnoDB on the master and MyISAM on the slave,
if the slave has less available disk space).
<LI>

The MySQL buffers' sizes (<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> etc) are different on
the master and slave. 
<LI>

The master and slave run different MySQL versions, and the optimiser
code is different between these versions.
</UL>

This problem may also affect database restoration using <CODE>mysqlbinlog|mysql</CODE>.

The easiest way to avoid this problem in all cases is add an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause to 
such non-deterministic queries to ensure that the rows are always
stored/modified in the same order. 
In future MySQL versions we will automatically add an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
clause when needed.

</UL>

<P>
The following problems are known and will be fixed in due time:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is not <CODE>multi-byte character</CODE> safe. Comparison is done
character by character.
<LI>

When using <CODE>RPAD</CODE> function, or any other string function that ends
up adding blanks to the right, in a query that has to use temporary
table to be resolved, then all resulting strings will be RTRIM'ed. This
is an example of the query:

<CODE>SELECT    RPAD(t1.field1, 50, ' ') AS f2,    RPAD(t2.field2, 50, '
') AS f1  FROM    table1 as t1     LEFT JOIN table2 AS t2 ON
t1.record=t2.joinID ORDER BY t2.record;</CODE> 

Final result of this bug is that use will not be able to get blanks on
the right side of the resulting field. 

The above behaviour exists in all versions of MySQL. 

The reason for this is due to the fact that HEAP tables, which are used
first for temporary tables, are not capable of handling VARCHAR columns.

This behaviour will be fixed in one of the 4.1 series releases.

<LI>

Because of how table definitions files are stored one can't use
character 255 (<CODE>CHAR(255)</CODE>) in table names, column names or enums.
This is scheduled to be fixed in version 5.1 when we have new table
definition format files.

<LI>

When using <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE>, one can't use translated
characters in database, table, and column names.

<LI>

One can't use <CODE>_</CODE> or <CODE>%</CODE> with <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> in <CODE>LIKE
... ESCAPE</CODE>.

<LI>

If you have a <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> column with a  number stored in different
formats (+01.00, 1.00, 01.00), <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> may regard each value
as a different value.

<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables.

<LI>

You cannot build the server in another directory when using
MIT-pthreads. Because this requires changes to MIT-pthreads, we are not
likely to fix this. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> values can't ``reliably'' be used in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>. Only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE>
bytes (default 1024) are used when comparing <CODE>BLOB</CODE>s in these cases.
This can be changed with the <CODE>-O max_sort_length</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. A workaround for most cases is to use a substring:
<CODE>SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(blob,2048) FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

<LI>

Calculation is done with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> (both are
normally 64 bits long). It depends on the function which precision one
gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE>
precision, <CODE>IF</CODE>, and <CODE>ELT()</CODE> with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
precision and the rest with <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> precision.  One should try to
avoid using unsigned long long values if they resolve to be bigger than
63 bits (9223372036854775807) for anything else than bit fields.
MySQL Server 4.0 has better <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> handling than 3.23.

<LI>

All string columns, except <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, automatically
have all trailing spaces removed when retrieved. For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> types this
is okay, and may be regarded as a feature according to SQL-92. The bug is
that in MySQL Server, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are treated the same way.

<LI>

You can only have up to 255 <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns in one table.

<LI>

In <CODE>MIN()</CODE>, <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and other aggregate functions, MySQL
currently compares <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns by their string
value rather than by the string's relative position in the set.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> redirects all messages from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> log.  One problem with this is that if you execute
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE> to close and reopen the log,
<CODE>stdout</CODE> and <CODE>stderr</CODE> are still redirected to the old log.
If you use <CODE>--log</CODE> extensively, you should edit <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> to
log to <TT>`'hostname'.err'</TT> instead of <TT>`'hostname'.log'</TT> so you can
easily reclaim the space for the old log by deleting the old one and
executing <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>.

<LI>

In the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement, columns are updated from left to right.  If
you refer to an updated column, you will get the updated value instead of the
original value. For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;
</PRE>

This will update <CODE>KEY</CODE> with <CODE>2</CODE> instead of with <CODE>1</CODE>.

<LI>

You can refer to multiple temporary tables in the same query, but
you cannot refer to any given temporary table more than once.
For example, the following doesn't work:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM temporary_table, temporary_table AS t2;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>RENAME</CODE> doesn't work with <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> tables or tables used in a
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

<LI>

The optimiser may handle <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> differently if you are using
'hidden' columns in a join or not.  In a join, hidden columns are
counted as part of the result (even if they are not shown) while in
normal queries hidden columns don't participate in the <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>
comparison.  We will probably change this in the future to never compare
the hidden columns when executing <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>.

An example of this is:


<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads
       WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id DESC;
</PRE>

and


<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id
       FROM band_downloads,band_mp3
       WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9
       AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id
       ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;
</PRE>

In the second case you may in MySQL Server 3.23.x get two identical rows
in the result set (because the hidden <CODE>id</CODE> column may differ).

Note that this happens only for queries where you don't have the
ORDER BY columns in the result, something that you are not allowed
to do in SQL-92.

<LI>

Because MySQL Server allows you to work with table types that don't
support transactions, and thus can't <CODE>rollback</CODE> data, some things
behave a little differently in MySQL Server than in other SQL servers.
This is just to ensure that MySQL Server never needs to do a rollback
for an SQL command.  This may be a little awkward at times as column
values must be checked in the application, but this will actually give
you a nice speed increase as it allows MySQL Server to do some
optimisations that otherwise would be very hard to do.

If you set a column to an incorrect value, MySQL Server will, instead of
doing a rollback, store the <CODE>best possible value</CODE> in the column:


<UL>
<LI>

If you try to store a value outside the range in a numerical column,
MySQL Server will instead store the smallest or biggest possible value in
the column.

<LI>

If you try to store a string that doesn't start with a number into a
numerical column, MySQL Server will store 0 into it.

<LI>

If you try to store <CODE>NULL</CODE> into a column that doesn't take
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values, MySQL Server will store 0 or <CODE>''</CODE> (empty
string) in it instead. (This behaviour can, however, be changed with the
-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS compile option.)

<LI>

MySQL allows you to store some wrong date values into <CODE>DATE</CODE> and
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns (like 2000-02-31 or 2000-02-00).  The idea is
that it's not the SQL server job to validate date.  If MySQL can store a
date and retrieve exactly the same date, then MySQL will store the
date. If the date is totally wrong (outside the server's ability to store
it), then the special date value 0000-00-00 will be stored in the column.

<LI>

If you set an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column to an unsupported value, it will be set to
the error value <CODE>empty string</CODE>, with numeric value 0.

<LI>

If you set a <CODE>SET</CODE> column to an unsupported value, the value will
be ignored.

</UL>

<LI>

If you execute a <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> on a query that returns an empty set,
in some cases the <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> will not transform the columns.

<LI>

Creation of a table of type <CODE>MERGE</CODE> doesn't check if the underlying
tables are of compatible types.

<LI>

MySQL Server can't yet handle <CODE>NaN</CODE>, <CODE>-Inf</CODE>, and <CODE>Inf</CODE>
values in double. Using these will cause problems when trying to export
and import data. We should as an intermediate solution change <CODE>NaN</CODE> to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> (if possible) and <CODE>-Inf</CODE> and <CODE>Inf</CODE> to the
minimum respective maximum possible <CODE>double</CODE> value.

<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> on negative numbers are treated as big positive numbers.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to first add a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index to a
table used in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and then use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
add a normal index on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, the key order will be
different for the tables if there was an old key that was not unique in the
table. This is because <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> puts <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys before
normal keys to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
</UL>

<P>
The following are known bugs in earlier versions of MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can get a hung thread if you do a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is
one among many tables that is locked with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.

<LI>

In the following case you can get a core dump:


<UL>
<LI>

Delayed insert handler has pending inserts to a table.

<LI>

<CODE>LOCK table</CODE> with <CODE>WRITE</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI>

Before MySQL Server Version 3.23.2 an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> that updated a key with
a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> on the same key may have failed because the key was used to
search for records and the same row may have been found multiple times:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY &#62; 100;
</PRE>

A workaround is to use:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY+0 &#62; 100;
</PRE>

This will work because MySQL Server will not use an index on expressions in
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Before MySQL Server Version 3.23, all numeric types were treated as
fixed-point fields. That means you had to specify how many decimals
a floating-point field shall have. All results were returned with the
correct number of decimals.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>

</P>

<P>
This section summarises the features that we plan to implement in
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>. The lists are broken up per version, and the items
are approximately in the order they will be done.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If you are an enterprise level user with an urgent need
for a particular feature, please contact <a HREF="mailto:sales@mysql.com">sales@mysql.com</a> to
discuss sponsoring options. Targeted financing by one or more companies
allows us to allocate additional resources for that specific purpose.
One example of a feature sponsored in the past is replication.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_4.1" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_4.1">1.8.1  New Features Planned For 4.1</A></H3>

<P>
The features below are not yet implemented in MySQL 4.1, but are planned
for implementation before MySQL 4.1 moves into its beta phase.
For a list what is already done in MySQL 4.1, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Nutshell_4.1_features">1.5.2.1  Features Available in MySQL 4.1</A>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Stable OpenSSL support (MySQL 4.0 supports rudimentary, not 100% tested,
support for OpenSSL).
<LI>

Character set casts and syntax for handling multiple character sets.
<LI>

More testing of prepared statements and multiple characters sets for one
table.
</UL>

<P>
Development of other things has already shifted to the 5.0 tree.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_5.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_5.0">1.8.2  New Features Planned For 5.0</A></H3>

<P>
The following features are planned for inclusion into MySQL 5.0.
Note that because we have many developers that are working on different
projects, there will also be many additional features. There is also a
small chance that some of these features will be added to MySQL 4.1.
For a list what is already done in MySQL 4.1, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Nutshell_4.1_features">1.5.2.1  Features Available in MySQL 4.1</A>.

</P>
<P>
For those wishing to take a look at the bleeding edge of MySQL
development, we have made our BitKeeper repository for
MySQL version 5.0 publicly available.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source_tree">2.3.4  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Stored Procedures
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Stored procedures are currently being implemented.
This effort is based on SQL-99, which has a basic
syntax similar (but not identical) to Oracle PL/SQL. We will also
implement the SQL-99 framework to hook in external languages, and
(where possible) compatibility with, for example, PL/SQL and T-SQL.
</UL>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Elementary cursor support.
<LI>

Visible <CODE>RTREE</CODE> index for MyISAM tables.  In 4.1 RTREE indexes are
used internally for geometrical data, but not directly usable.
<LI>

Dynamic length rows for HEAP tables.
</UL>

<DT>Standards compliance, portability and migration
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Add true <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> support (there is already support for this in
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>).
</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name</CODE> (used by <CODE>mysql</CODE> client to allow
expansions of column names) should not open the table, only the
definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>DELETE</CODE> on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables to use the record cache.
To do this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update
the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file.
<LI>

Better in-memory (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>) tables:

<UL>
<LI>

Dynamic size rows.
<LI>

Faster row handling (less copying).
</UL>

</UL>

<DT>Internationalisation
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

When using <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> we should translate the whole query
at once and not only strings. This will enable users to use the translated
characters in database, table, and column names.
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Resolving the issue of <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> on a table used in an active
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table possibly corrupting the table.
</UL>

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_5.1" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_5.1">1.8.3  New Features Planned For 5.1</A></H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> support for all table types.
<LI>

Column-level constraints.
<LI>

Fail-safe replication.
<LI>

Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online backup will
make it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down the
master.
</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

New text based table definition file format (<TT>`.frm'</TT> files) and a
table cache for table definitions.  This will enable us to do faster
queries of table structures and do more efficient foreign key support.
<LI>

Optimise <CODE>BIT</CODE> type to take 1 bit (now <CODE>BIT</CODE> takes 1 char).
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Add options to the client/server protocol to get progress notes
for long running commands.
<LI>

Implement <CODE>RENAME DATABASE</CODE>. To make this safe for all storage engines,
it should work as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

Create the new database.
<LI>

For every table do a rename of the table to another database, as
we do with the <CODE>RENAME</CODE> command.
<LI>

Drop the old database.
</UL>

<LI>

New internal file interface change.  This will make all file handling much
more general and make it easier to add extensions like RAID.
(The current implementation is a hack.)
</UL>

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_future" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_future">1.8.4  New Features Planned for the Near Future</A></H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Oracle-like <CODE>CONNECT BY PRIOR ...</CODE> to search tree-like (hierarchical)
structures.
<LI>

Add all missing SQL-92 and ODBC 3.0 types.
<LI>

Add <CODE>SUM(DISTINCT)</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld --concurrent-insert</CODE> to do
a concurrent insert at the end of the file if the file is read-locked.
<LI>

Allow update of variables in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements. For example:
<CODE>UPDATE TABLE foo SET @a=a+b,a=@a, b=@a+c</CODE>.
<LI>

Change when user variables are updated so that one can use them with
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, as in the following example:
<CODE>SELECT id, @a:=COUNT(*), SUM(sum_col)/@a FROM table_name GROUP BY id</CODE>.
<LI>

Add an <CODE>IMAGE</CODE> option to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to not update
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> and <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> fields.
<LI>

Added <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ... UPDATE</CODE> syntax.

<UL>
<LI>

For tables with primary keys, if the data contains the primary key,
entries matching that primary key are updated from the remainder of the
columns. However, columns <STRONG>missing</STRONG> from the incoming data feed are not
touched.
<LI>

For tables with primary keys that are missing some part of the key
in the incoming data stream, or that have no primary key, the feed is
treated as a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ... REPLACE INTO</CODE> now.
</UL>

<LI>

Make <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> understand syntax like:

<PRE>
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
     TEXT_FIELDS (text_field1, text_field2, text_field3)
     SET table_field1=CONCAT(text_field1, text_field2),
         table_field3=23
     IGNORE text_field3
</PRE>

This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file,
or update columns based on expressions of the read data.
<LI>

New functions for working with <CODE>SET</CODE> type columns:

<UL>
<LI><CODE>ADD_TO_SET(value,set)</CODE>

<LI><CODE>REMOVE_FROM_SET(value,set)</CODE>

</UL>

<LI>

If you abort <CODE>mysql</CODE> in the middle of a query, you should open
another connection and kill the old running query.
Alternatively, an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.
<LI>

Add a storage engine interface for table information so that you can use it as a system
table. This would be a bit slow if you requested information about all tables,
but very flexible.  <CODE>SHOW INFO FROM tbl_name</CODE> for basic table information
should be implemented.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>SELECT a FROM crash_me LEFT JOIN crash_me2 USING (a)</CODE>; in this
case <CODE>a</CODE> is assumed to come from the <CODE>crash_me</CODE> table.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> options to the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement
(this will delete rows when one gets a duplicate key error while updating).
<LI>

Change the format of <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> to store fractions of seconds.
<LI>

Make it possible to use the new GNU regexp library instead of the current
one (the GNU library should be much faster than the old one).
</UL>

<DT>Standards compliance, portability and migration
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Don't add automatic <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values to columns.  Give an error
when using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> that doesn't contain a column that doesn't
have a <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.
<LI>

Add <CODE>ANY()</CODE>, <CODE>EVERY()</CODE>, and <CODE>SOME()</CODE> group functions. In
standard SQL these work only on boolean columns, but we can extend these to
work on any columns/expressions by applying: value == 0 -&#62; FALSE and
value &#60;&#62; 0 -&#62; TRUE.
<LI>

Fix that the type for <CODE>MAX(column)</CODE> is the same as the column type:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t1 (a DATE);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NOW());
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT MAX(a) FROM t1;
mysql&#62; SHOW COLUMNS FROM t2;
</PRE>

</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run MyISAM recover
at the same time.
<LI>

Change <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> to optionally use concurrent inserts.
<LI>

Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with delayed
keys if they haven't been used in a while.
<LI>

Allow join on key parts (optimisation issue).
<LI>

Add simulation of <CODE>pread()</CODE>/<CODE>pwrite()</CODE> on Windows to enable
concurrent inserts.
<LI>

A logfile analyser that could parse out information about which tables
are hit most often, how often multi-table joins are executed, etc.  It
should help users identify areas or table design that could be optimised
to execute much more efficient queries.
</UL>

<DT>Internationalisation
<DD>

<UL>
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Return the original field types() when doing
<CODE>SELECT MIN(column) ... GROUP BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Make it possible to specify <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> with a granularity
in microseconds.
<LI>

Link the <CODE>myisampack</CODE> code into the server, enabling a PACK or
COMPRESS command on the server.
<LI>

Add a temporary key buffer cache during <CODE>INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE</CODE> so that we
can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.
<LI>

If you perform an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a table that is symlinked to another
disk, create temporary tables on this disk.
<LI>

Implement a <CODE>DATE/DATETIME</CODE> type that handles time zone information
properly so that dealing with dates in different time zones is easier.
<LI>

Fix configure so that one can compile all libraries (like <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>)
without threads.
<LI>

Allow SQL variables in <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, like in <CODE>LIMIT @a,@b</CODE>.
<LI>

Automatic output from <CODE>mysql</CODE> to a web browser.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK DATABASES</CODE> (with various options).
<LI>

Many more variables for <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE>.  Records reads and
updates.  Selects on 1 table and selects with joins.  Mean number of
tables in select. Number of <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin copy database new-database</CODE>; requires <CODE>COPY</CODE>
command to be added to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Processlist should show number of queries/threads.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW HOSTS</CODE> for printing information about the hostname cache.
<LI>

Change table names from empty strings to <CODE>NULL</CODE> for calculated columns.
<LI>

Don't use <CODE>Item_copy_string</CODE> on numerical values to avoid
number-&#62;string-&#62;number conversion in case of:
<CODE>SELECT COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM table_name GROUP BY id</CODE>
<LI>

Change so that <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> doesn't abort clients
that execute <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix so that when columns are referenced in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> clause,
they contain the old values from before the update started.
</UL>

<DT>New operating systems
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Port of the MySQL clients to LynxOS.
</UL>

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_sometime" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_sometime">1.8.5  New Features Planned for the Mid-Term Future</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Implement function: <CODE>get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)</CODE>.
<LI>

Change reading through tables to use memmap when possible. Now only
compressed tables use memmap.
<LI>

Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the update
log with <CODE>SET TIMESTAMP=#;</CODE>.
<LI>

Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.
<LI>

Simple views (stepwise implementation up to full functionality).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_Views">1.7.4.6  Views</A>.
<LI>

Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table, or temporary files
gets error 23 (not enough open files).
<LI>

When one finds a field=#, change all occurrences of field to #.  Now this
is only done for some simple cases.
<LI>

Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if possible.
<LI>

Optimise key = expression. At the moment only key = field or key =
constant are optimised.
<LI>

Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.
<LI>

Change <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT> to an inline parser to reduce its size and get
better error messages (5 days).
<LI>

Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of arguments
in function.
<LI>

Use of full calculation names in the order part (for ACCESS97).
<LI>

<CODE>MINUS</CODE>, <CODE>INTERSECT</CODE>, and <CODE>FULL OUTER JOIN</CODE>.
(Currently <CODE>UNION</CODE> [in 4.0] and <CODE>LEFT|RIGHT OUTER JOIN</CODE> are supported.)
<LI>

<CODE>SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=#</CODE> to put a time limit on a query.
<LI>

Make the update log write to a database.
<LI>

Enhance <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> to allow retrieval of data from the end of a result set.
<LI>

Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.
<LI>

Please note the changes to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>: according to FSSTND (which
Debian tries to follow) PID files should go into <TT>`/var/run/&#60;progname&#62;.pid'</TT>
and log files into <TT>`/var/log'</TT>. It would be nice if you could put the
"DATADIR" in the first declaration of "pidfile" and "log", so the
placement of these files can be changed with a single statement.
<LI>

Allow a client to request logging.
<LI>

Add use of <CODE>zlib()</CODE> for <CODE>gzip</CODE>-ed files to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix sorting and grouping of <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns (partly solved now).
<LI>

Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first implement
a semaphore library to MIT-pthreads.
<LI>

Don't assign a new <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value when one sets a column to 0.
Use <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead.
<LI>

Add full support for <CODE>JOIN</CODE> with parentheses.
<LI>

As an alternative for one thread/connection manage a pool of threads
to handle the queries.
<LI>

Allow one to get more than one lock with <CODE>GET_LOCK</CODE>.  When doing this,
one must also handle the possible deadlocks this change will introduce.
</UL>

<P>
This chapter describes how to obtain and install MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For a list of sites from which you can obtain MySQL, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_MySQL">2.2.1  How to Get MySQL</A>.

<LI>

To see which platforms are supported, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>. Please note that
not all supported systems are equally good for running MySQL on them.
On some it is much more robust and efficient than others--see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>
for details.

<LI>

Several versions of MySQL are available in both binary and
source distributions.  We also provide public access to our current
source tree for those who want to see our most recent developments and
help us test new code.  To determine which version and type of
distribution you should use, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_version">2.2.6  Which MySQL Version to Use</A>. When in doubt,
use a binary distribution.

<LI>

Installation instructions for binary and source distributions are described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.11  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>, and section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.  Each set of
instructions includes a section on system-specific problems you may run
into.

<LI>

For post-installation procedures, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>.  These
procedures apply whether you install MySQL using a binary or
source distribution.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="Quick_Standard_Installation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Quick_Standard_Installation">2.1  Quick Standard Installation of MySQL</A></H2>

<P>
This chapter covers the installation of MySQL on platforms where we
offer packages using the native packaging format of the respective
platform. However, binary distributions of MySQL are available for many
other platforms as well, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.11  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A> for generic
installation instructions for these packages that apply to all platforms.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#General_Installation_Issues">2.2  General Installation Issues</A> for more information on what other binary
distributions are available on how to obtain them.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Windows_installation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows_installation">2.1.1  Installing MySQL on Windows</A></H3>

<P>
The MySQL server for Windows is available in two distribution formats:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The binary distribution contains a setup program that installs
everything you need so that you can start the server immediately.

<LI>

The source distribution contains all the code and support files
for building the executables using the VC++ 6.0 compiler.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_source_build">2.3.7  Windows Source Distribution</A>.

</UL>

<P>
Generally speaking, you should use the binary distribution. It's simpler, and
you need no additional tools to get MySQL up and running.

</P>
<P>
You will need the following:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

A 32-bit Windows Operating System such as 9x, Me, NT, 2000, or XP.
The NT family (Windows NT, 2000, and XP) permits you to run the MySQL server
as a service. See section <A HREF="manual.html#NT_start">2.6.1.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT, 2000, or XP</A>.

If you need tables with a size larger than 4 GB, install MySQL
on an NTFS or newer filesystem. Don't forget to use <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> and
<CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> when you create tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

TCP/IP protocol support.

<LI>

A copy of the MySQL binary distribution for Windows, which
can be downloaded from <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.

Note: The distribution files are supplied with a zipped format
and we recommend the use of an adequate FTP client with resume
feature to avoid corruption of files during the download process.

<LI>

A <CODE>ZIP</CODE> program to unpack the distribution file.

<LI>

Enough space on the hard drive to unpack, install, and create the
databases in accordance with your requirements.

<LI>

If you plan to connect to the MySQL server via ODBC, you
will also need the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC">11.2  MySQL ODBC Support</A>.

<LI>

If you are working on an NT/2000/XP server, log on as a user with
administrator privileges.

<LI>

If you are doing an upgrade of an earlier MySQL installation,
it is necessary to stop the current server. If you are running the server
as a service, stop it using this command:


<PRE>
C:\&#62; NET STOP MySQL
</PRE>

Otherwise, stop the server like this:


<PRE>
C:\mysql\bin&#62; mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<LI>

On NT/2000/XP machines, if you want to change the server executable
(for example, <CODE>-max</CODE> or <CODE>-nt</CODE>), it is also necessary to
remove the service:


<PRE>
C:\mysql\bin&#62; mysqld --remove
</PRE>

<LI>

Exit the <CODE>WinMySQLadmin</CODE> program if it is running.

<LI>

Unzip the distribution file to a temporary directory.

<P>
All of the preceding binaries are optimised for modern Intel processors
but should work on any Intel processor &#62;= i386.

</P>
<P>
When run on a version of Windows that supports named pipes (NT, 2000, XP),
the <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> servers support named pipe
connections.  However, starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are enabled only
if you start these servers with the <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE> option.
(The servers can be run on Windows 98 or Me, but TCP/IP must be installed,
and named pipe connections cannot be used. On Windows 95, these servers
cannot be used.)

<P>
You will find it helpful to use an option file to specify your MySQL
configuration under the following circumstances:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The installation or data directories are different from the default
locations (<TT>`C:\mysql'</TT> and <TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT>).

<LI>

You need to tune the server settings.
For example, if you want to use the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> transactional tables in
MySQL version 3.23, you
need to manually create two new directories to hold the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
data and log files--such as, <TT>`C:\ibdata'</TT> and <TT>`C:\iblogs'</TT>.
You will also need to add some extra lines to the option
file, as described in section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.3  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.
(As of MySQL 4.0, InnoDB will create its datafiles and log files in the data
directory by default. This means you need not configure InnoDB explicitly,
though you may still wish to do so.)

</UL>

<P>
On Windows, the MySQL installer places the data directory directly under
the directory where you install MySQL.  If you would like to use a data
directory in a different location, you should copy the entire contents
of the <TT>`data'</TT> directory to the new location. For example, the default
installation places MySQL in <TT>`C:\mysql'</TT> and the data directory in
<TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT>. If you want to use a data directory of <TT>`E:\mydata'</TT>,
you must copy <TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT> there. You will also need to use a
<CODE>--datadir</CODE> option to specify the location of the new data directory.

</P>
<P>
Normally you can use the <CODE>WinMySQLAdmin</CODE> tool to edit the
option file <TT>`my.ini'</TT>.  In this case you don't have to worry
about the following discussion.

</P>
<P>
There are two option files with the same function: <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT>,
and the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file in the Windows directory.  (This directory
typically is named something like <TT>`C:\WINDOWS'</TT> or <TT>`C:\WinNT'</TT>.
You can determine its exact location from the value of the <CODE>WINDIR</CODE>
environment variable.)  MySQL looks first for the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file,
then for the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file.  However, to avoid confusion, it's best
if you use only one of these files. Both files are plain text.

</P>
<P>
If your PC uses a boot loader where the <CODE>C:</CODE> drive isn't the boot drive,
your only option is to use the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file.  Also note that
if you use the <CODE>WinMySQLAdmin</CODE> tool, it uses only the <TT>`my.ini'</TT>
file.  The <TT>`\mysql\bin'</TT> directory contains a help file with
instructions for using this tool.

</P>
<P>
Using the <CODE>notepad</CODE> program, create the option file and edit the
<CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section to specify values for the <CODE>basedir</CODE> and
<CODE>datadir</CODE> parameters:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path, for example, C:/mysql
basedir=the_install_path
# set datadir to the location of your data directory,
# for example, C:/mysql/data or D:/mydata/data
datadir=the_data_path
</PRE>

<P>
Note that Windows pathnames should be specified in option files using
forward slashes rather than backslashes.  If you do use backslashes, you
must double them.

</P>
<P>
Now you are ready to test starting the server.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Windows_server_first_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows_server_first_start">2.1.1.3  Starting the Server for the First Time</A></H4>

<P>
Testing is best done from a command prompt in a console window (a ``DOS
window''). This way you can have the server display status messages in the
window where they are easy to see.  If something is wrong with your
configuration, these messages will make it easier for you to identify
and fix any problems.

</P>
<P>
Make sure you are in the directory where the server is located, then
enter this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --console
</PRE>

<P>
For servers that include <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> support,
you should see the following messages as the server starts up:

</P>

<PRE>
InnoDB: The first specified datafile c:\ibdata\ibdata1 did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!

</PRE>

<P>
When the server finishes its startup sequence, you should see something
like this, which indicates that the server is ready to service client
connections::

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld: ready for connections
Version: '4.0.14-log'  socket: ''  port: 3306
</PRE>

<P>
The server will continue to write to the console any further diagnostic
output it produces.  You can open a new console window in which to run
client programs.

</P>
<P>
If you omit the <CODE>--console</CODE> option, the server writes diagnostic output
to the error log in the data directory. The error log is the file with the
<TT>`.err'</TT> extension.

<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>

</P>
<P>
The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using the RPM
packages. The MySQL RPMs are currently built on a SuSE Linux 7.3
system but should work on most versions of Linux that support <CODE>rpm</CODE>
and use <CODE>glibc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with an RPM file (for example, if you receive the error
``<CODE>Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up</CODE>''), see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_notes-Linux">2.6.2.1  Linux Notes for Binary Distributions</A>.

</P>
<P>
In most cases, you only need to install the <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE> and
<CODE>MySQL-client</CODE> packages to get a functional MySQL installation. The
other packages are not required for a standard installation.
If you want to run a MySQL Max server that has additional capabilities,
you should install the <CODE>MySQL-Max</CODE> RPM after installing the
<CODE>MySQL-server</CODE> RPM.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get a dependency failure when trying to install the MySQL 4.0
packages (for example, ``<CODE>error: removing these packages would break dependencies:
libmysqlclient.so.10 is needed by ...</CODE>''), you should also install
the package <CODE>MySQL-shared-compat</CODE>, which includes both the
shared libraries for backward compatibility (<CODE>libmysqlclient.so.12</CODE>
for MySQL 4.0 and <CODE>libmysqlclient.so.10</CODE> for MySQL 3.23).

</P>
<P>
Many Linux distributions still ship with MySQL 3.23 and they usually link
applications dynamically to save disk space. If these shared libraries are
in a separate package (for example, <CODE>MySQL-shared</CODE>), it is
sufficient to simply leave this package installed and just upgrade
the MySQL server and client packages (which are statically linked
and do not depend on the shared libraries). For distributions that
include the shared libraries in the same package as the MySQL server
(for example, Red Hat Linux), you could either install our 3.23
<CODE>MySQL-shared</CODE> RPM, or use the <CODE>MySQL-shared-compat</CODE> package instead.

</P>
<P>
The following RPM packages are available:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to
connect to a MySQL server running on another machine. Please note
that this package was called <CODE>MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE> before
MySQL 4.0.10.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-Max-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The MySQL Max server. This server has additional capabilities that the
one in the <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE> RPM does not.  You must install the
<CODE>MySQL-server</CODE> RPM first, because the <CODE>MySQL-Max</CODE> RPM depends on it.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to
install this package.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and the <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> module.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The libraries and include files that are needed if you want to compile other
MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-shared-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

This package contains the shared libraries (<CODE>libmysqlclient.so*</CODE>)
that certain languages and applications need to dynamically load and
use MySQL.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-shared-compat-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

This package includes the shared libraries for both MySQL 3.23 and
MySQL 4.0. Install this package instead of <CODE>MySQL-shared</CODE>, if you
have applications installed that are dynamically linked against MySQL
3.23 but you want to upgrade to MySQL 4.0 without breaking the library
dependencies. This package is available since MySQL 4.0.13.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-embedded-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The embedded MySQL server library (from MySQL 4.0).

<LI><CODE>MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm</CODE>

This contains the source code for all of the previous packages. It can also
be used to rebuild the RPMs on other architectures (for example, Alpha or SPARC).
</UL>

<P>
To see all files in an RPM package (for example, a <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE>
RPM), run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -qpl MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
To perform a standard minimal installation, run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -i MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
To install just the client package, run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
The server RPM places data under the <TT>`/var/lib/mysql'</TT> directory. The
RPM also creates the appropriate entries in <TT>`/etc/init.d/'</TT> to start the
server automatically at boot time. (This means that if you have performed a
previous installation and have made changes to its startup script, you may
want to make a copy of the script so you don't lose it when you install a
newer RPM.) See section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A> for more information on how MySQL can be
started automatically on system startup.

</P>
<P>
If you want to install the MySQL RPM on older Linux distributions that do
not support initialisation scripts in <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> (directly
or via a symlink), you should create a symbolic link that points
to the location where your initialisation scripts actually are
installed. For example, if that location is <TT>`/etc/rc.d/init.d'</TT>,
use these commands before installing the RPM to create <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT>
as a symbolic link that points there:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /etc; ln -s rc.d/init.d .
</PRE>

<P>
However, all current major Linux distributions should already support the
new directory layout that uses <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT>, because it is
required for LSB (Linux Standard Base) compliance.

</P>
<P>
If the RPM files that you install include <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE>, the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon should be up and running after installation.
You should now be able to start using MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>.

If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the binary
installation chapter. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.11  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>.

<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL 4.0.11, you can install MySQL on Mac OS X 10.2
(``Jaguar'') using a Mac OS X <CODE>PKG</CODE> binary package instead of the
binary tarball distribution. Please note that older versions of Mac OS X
(for example, 10.1.x) are not supported by this package.

</P>
<P>
The package is located inside a disk image (<CODE>.dmg</CODE>) file, that you
first need to mount by double-clicking its icon in the Finder. It should
then mount the image and display its contents.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Before proceeding with the installation, be sure to
shut down all running MySQL server instances by either
using the MySQL Manager Application (on Mac OS X Server) or via
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> on the command line.

</P>
<P>
To actually install the MySQL PKG, double click on the package icon. This
launches the Mac OS Package Installer, which will guide you through
the installation of MySQL.

</P>
<P>
The Mac OS X PKG of MySQL will install itself into
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql-&#60;version&#62;'</TT> and will also install a symbolic link
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>, pointing to the new location. If a directory named
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> already exists, it will be renamed to
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql.bak'</TT> first. Additionally, it will install the
grant tables in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database by executing <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
after the installation.

</P>
<P>
The installation layout is similar to the one of the binary distribution;
all MySQL binaries are located in the directory <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/bin'</TT>.
The MySQL socket file is created as <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT> by default.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installation_layouts">2.2.7  Installation Layouts</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL installation requires a Mac OS X user account named <CODE>mysql</CODE>
(a user account with this name should exist by default
on Mac OS X 10.2 and up).

</P>
<P>
If you are running Mac OS X Server, you already have a version of MySQL
installed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mac OS X Server 10.2-10.2.2 come with MySQL 3.23.51 installed
<LI>

Mac OS X Server 10.2.3-10.2.6 ship with MySQL 3.23.53
</UL>

<P>
This manual section covers the installation of the official MySQL Mac OS X
PKG only.  Make sure to read Apple's help about installing MySQL (Run the
``Help View'' application, select ``Mac OS X Server'' help, and do a search for
``MySQL'' and read the item entitled ``Installing MySQL'').

</P>
<P>
Especially note that the pre-installed version of MySQL on Mac OS X Server
is started with the command <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> instead of <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you previously used Marc Liyanage's MySQL packages for Mac OS X from
<a HREF="http://www.entropy.ch">http://www.entropy.ch</a>, you can simply follow the update instructions
for packages using the binary installation layout as given on his pages.

</P>
<P>
If you are upgrading from Marc's 3.23.xx versions or from the Mac OS X
Server version of MySQL to the official MySQL PKG, you also need to convert
the existing MySQL privilege tables to the current format, because
some new security privileges have been added.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you would like to automatically start up MySQL during system bootup, you
also need to install the MySQL Startup Item. Starting with MySQL 4.0.15, it
is part of the Mac OS X installation disk images as a separate installation
package. Simply double-click the <CODE>MySQLStartupItem.pkg</CODE> icon and follow
the instructions to install it.

</P>
<P>
Note that this only has to be done once! There is no need to install the
Startup Item every time you upgrade the MySQL package.

</P>
<P>
The Startup Item will be installed into <TT>`/Library/StartupItems/MySQL'</TT>.
It adds a variable <CODE>MYSQLCOM=-YES-</CODE> to the system configuration file
<TT>`/etc/hostconfig'</TT>. If you would like to disable the automatic startup
of MySQL, simply change this variable to <CODE>MYSQLCOM=-NO-</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Mac OS X Server, the Startup Item installation script will automatically
disable the startup of the default MySQL installation by changing the
variable <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> in <TT>`/etc/hostconfig'</TT> to <CODE>MYSQL=-NO-</CODE>. This
is to avoid conflicts on bootup. However, it does not shut down an already
running MySQL server.

</P>
<P>
After the installation, you can start up MySQL by running the following
commands in a terminal window. Please note that you need to have
administrator privileges to perform this task.

</P>
<P>
If you have installed the Startup Item:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQL/MySQL start
(Enter your password, if necessary)
(Press Control-D or enter "exit" to exit the shell)
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't use the Startup Item, enter the following command sequence:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; sudo ./bin/mysqld_safe
(Enter your password, if necessary)
(Press Control-Z)
shell&#62; bg
(Press Control-D or enter "exit" to exit the shell)
</PRE>

<P>
You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server, for example, by running
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you installed MySQL for the first time, <STRONG>please remember to set a
password for the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user!</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
This is done with the following two commands:

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password &#60;password&#62;
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h `hostname` password &#60;password&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Please make sure that the <CODE>hostname</CODE> command in the second line
is enclosed by <STRONG>backticks</STRONG> (`), so the shell can replace it with
the output of this command (the host name of this system)!

</P>
<P>
You might want to also add aliases to your shell's resource file to
access <CODE>mysql</CODE> and <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> from the command line:

</P>

<PRE>
alias mysql '/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql'
alias mysqladmin '/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin'
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you could simply add <CODE>/usr/local/mysql/bin</CODE> to
your <CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable, for example, by adding the following
to <TT>`$HOME/.tcshrc'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin
</PRE>

<P>
Please note that installing a new MySQL PKG does not remove the directory
of an older installation. Unfortunately, the Mac OS X Installer does not yet
offer the functionality required to properly upgrade previously installed
packages.

</P>
<P>
After you have copied over the MySQL database files from the
previous version and have successfully started the new version, you should
consider removing the old installation files to save disk space.
Additionally, you should also remove older versions of the Package Receipt
directories located in <TT>`/Library/Receipts/mysql-&#60;version&#62;.pkg'</TT>.

As of version 4.0.11, the MySQL server is available for Novell NetWare in
binary package form. In order to host MySQL, the NetWare server must meet
these requirements:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

NetWare version 6.5, or NetWare 6.0 with Support Pack 3 installed (You can
obtain this at <a HREF="http://support.novell.com/filefinder/13659/index.html">http://support.novell.com/filefinder/13659/index.html</a>).
The system must meet Novell's minimum requirements to run the respective
version of NetWare.
<LI>

MySQL data, as well as the binaries themselves, must be installed on an
NSS volume; traditional volumes are not supported.
</UL>

<P>
The binary package for NetWare can be obtained at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you are running MySQL on NetWare 6.0, we strongly suggest that you use the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option on the command line. It will also be
neccesary to use <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> instead of
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> makes use of external locking.
External locking is known to have problems on NetWare 6.0; the problem has been
eliminated in NetWare 6.5.

<OL>
<LI>

If you are upgrading from a prior installation, stop the MySQL server.
This is done from the server console, using:


<PRE>
SERVER:  mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<LI>

Log on to the target server from a client machine with access to the
location where you will install MySQL.

<LI>

Extract the binary package zip file onto the server. Be sure to allow
the paths in the zip file to be used. It is safe to simply extract the
file to <TT>`SYS:\'</TT>.

If you are upgrading from a prior installation, you may need to copy the
data directory (for example, <TT>`SYS:MYSQL\DATA'</TT>) now, as well as <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
if you have customised it. You can then delete the old copy of MySQL.

<LI>

You may wish to rename the directory to something more consistent and easy
to use. We recommend using <TT>`SYS:MYSQL'</TT>; examples in the manual will
use this to refer to the installation directory in general.
<LI>

At the server console, add a search path for the directory containing the
MySQL NLMs. For example:


<PRE>
SERVER:  SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
</PRE>

<LI>

Install the initial database, if needed, by executing <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
at the server console.

<LI>

Start the MySQL server using <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> at the server console.

<LI>

To finish the installation, you should also add the following commands to
<CODE>autoexec.ncf</CODE>. For example, if your MySQL installation is in
<TT>`SYS:MYSQL'</TT> and you want MySQL to start automatically, you could
add these lines:


<PRE>
#Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
MYSQLD_SAFE
</PRE>

If you are using NetWare 6.0, you should add the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>
flag:


<PRE>
#Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
MYSQLD_SAFE --skip-external-locking
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
If there was an existing installation of MySQL on the server, be sure
to check for existing MySQL startup commands in <CODE>autoexec.ncf</CODE>,
and edit or delete them as necessary.

<H3>2.2.4  Signature Checking Using <CODE>GnuPG</CODE></H3>

<P>
A more reliable method of verifying the integrity of a package is using
cryptographic signatures. MySQL AB uses the <CODE>GNU Privacy Guard</CODE>
(<CODE>GnuPG</CODE>), an <CODE>Open Source</CODE> alternative to the very well-known
<CODE>Pretty Good Privacy</CODE> (<CODE>PGP</CODE>) by Phil Zimmermann.
See <a HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a> and <a HREF="http://www.openpgp.org/">http://www.openpgp.org/</a>
for more information about <CODE>OpenPGP</CODE>/<CODE>GnuPG</CODE> and how to obtain
and install <CODE>GnuPG</CODE> on your system. Most Linux distributions already
ship with <CODE>GnuPG</CODE> installed by default.

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10 (February 2003), MySQL AB has started signing
their downloadable packages with <CODE>GnuPG</CODE>. Cryptographic signatures are
a much more reliable method of verifying the integrity and authenticity of
a file.

</P>
<P>
To verify the signature for a specific package, you first need to obtain a
copy of MySQL AB's public GPG build key <a HREF="mailto:build@mysql.com">build@mysql.com</a>. You can
either cut and paste it directly from here, or obtain it from
<a HREF="http://www.keyserver.net/">http://www.keyserver.net/</a>.

<P>
You can import this key into your public <CODE>GPG</CODE> keyring by using
<CODE>gpg --import</CODE>. See the <CODE>GPG</CODE> documentation for more info
on how to work with public keys.

</P>
<P>
After you have downloaded and imported the public build key,
now download your desired MySQL package and the corresponding
signature, which is also available from the download page.
The signature has the file name extension <TT>`.asc'</TT>. For example,
the signature for <TT>`mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz'</TT>
would be <TT>`mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc'</TT>.
Make sure that both files are stored in the same directory and then run
the following command to verify the signature for this file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gpg --verify &#60;package&#62;.asc

Example:

shell&#62; gpg --verify mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: Signature made Mon 03 Feb 2003 08:50:39 PM MET using DSA key ID 5072E1F5
gpg: Good signature from

<P>
The "Good signature" message indicates that everything is all right.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>RPM</CODE> packages, there is no separate signature - <CODE>RPM</CODE> packages
actually have a built-in <CODE>GPG</CODE> signature and <CODE>MD5 checksum</CODE>. You can
verify them by running the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm --checksig &#60;package&#62;.rpm

Example:

shell&#62; rpm --checksig MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm
MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If you are using RPM 4.1 and it complains about <CODE>(GPG)
NOT OK (MISSING KEYS: GPG#5072e1f5)</CODE> (even though you have imported it into
your GPG public keyring), you need to import the key into the RPM keyring
first. RPM 4.1 no longer uses your GPG keyring (and GPG itself), but
rather maintains its own keyring (because it's a system wide application and
the GPG public keyring is user-specific file). To import the MySQL public
key into the RPM keyring, please use the following command:

the software ourselves primarily on Linux (SuSE and Red Hat), FreeBSD and
Sun Solaris (Versions 8 and 9).

<P>
Note that not all platforms are suited equally well for running
MySQL. How well a certain platform is suited for a high-load
mission-critical MySQL server is determined by the following
factors:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

General stability of the thread library. A platform may have excellent
reputation otherwise, but if the thread library is unstable in the code
that is called by MySQL, even if everything else is perfect, MySQL will
be only as stable as the thread library.

<LI>

The ability of the kernel and/or thread library to take advantage of
<STRONG>SMP</STRONG> on multi-processor systems. In other words, when a process
creates a thread, it should be possible for that thread to run on a different
CPU than the original process.

<LI>

The ability of the kernel and/or the thread library to run many threads which
acquire/release a mutex over a short critical region frequently without
excessive context switches. In other words, if the implementation of
<CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> is too anxious to yield CPU time, this will hurt
MySQL tremendously. If this issue is not taken care of, adding extra CPUs
will actually make MySQL slower.

<LI>

General filesystem stability/performance.

<LI>

Ability of the filesystem to deal with large files at all and deal with them
efficiently, if your tables are big.

<LI>

Our level of expertise here at MySQL AB with the platform. If we know
a platform well, we introduce platform-specific optimisations/fixes enabled at
compile time. We can also provide advice on configuring your system optimally
for MySQL.

<LI>

The amount of testing of similar configurations we have done internally.

<LI>

The number of users that have successfully run MySQL on that
platform in similar configurations. If this number is high, the chances of
hitting some platform-specific surprises are much smaller.
</UL>

<P>
Based on the preceding criteria, the best platforms for running
MySQL at this point are x86 with SuSE Linux 8.2, 2.4 kernel, and
ReiserFS (or any similar Linux distribution) and SPARC with Solaris
(2.7-9). FreeBSD comes third, but we really hope it will join the top
club once the thread library is improved. We also hope that at some
point we will be able to include all other platforms on which
MySQL compiles, runs okay, but not quite with the same level of
stability and performance, into the top category. This will require some
effort on our part in cooperation with the developers of the OS/library
components MySQL depends upon. If you are interested in making
one of those components better, are in a position to influence their
development, and need more detailed instructions on what MySQL
needs to run better, send an e-mail to the MySQL internals mailing list.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.

</P>
<P>
Please note that the preceding comparison is not to say that one OS is better or
worse than the other in general. We are talking about choosing a particular OS
for a dedicated purpose--running MySQL, and compare platforms in that
regard only. With this in mind, the result of this comparison
would be different if we included more issues into it. And in some cases,
the reason one OS is better than the other could simply be that we have put
forth more effort into testing on and optimising for that particular platform.
We are just stating our observations to help you decide on which
platform to use MySQL on in your setup.

</P>

<P>
The first decision to make is whether you want to use the latest development
release or the last production (stable) release:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time or trying
to port it to some system for which there is no binary distribution, we
recommend going with the production release (currently version 4.0).
Note that all MySQL releases are checked with the MySQL benchmarks and
an extensive test suite before each release (even the development
releases).

<LI>

Otherwise, if you are running an old system and want to upgrade, but
don't want to take chances with a non-seamless upgrade, you should
upgrade to the latest in the same branch you are using (where only the
last version number is newer than yours).  We have tried to fix only
fatal bugs and make small, relatively safe changes to that version.
</UL>

<P>
The second decision to make is whether you want to use a source
distribution or a binary distribution.  In most cases you should probably
use a binary distribution, if one exists for your platform, as this
generally will be easier to install than a source distribution.

</P>
<P>
In the following cases you probably will be better off with a source
installation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to install MySQL at some explicit location.  (The standard
binary distributions are ``ready to run'' at any place, but you may want
to get even more flexibility).

<LI>

To be able to satisfy different user requirements, we are providing two
different binary versions: one compiled with the non-transactional storage
engines (a small, fast binary), and one configured with the most
important extended options like transaction-safe tables.  Both versions
are compiled from the same source distribution.  All native <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
clients can connect to both MySQL versions.

The extended MySQL binary distribution is marked with the
<CODE>-max</CODE> suffix and is configured with the same options as
<CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

If you want to use the <CODE>MySQL-Max</CODE> RPM, you must first
install the standard <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE> RPM.

<LI>

If you want to configure <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with some extra features that are
not in the standard binary distributions.  Here is a list of the most
common extra options that you may want to use:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>--with-innodb</CODE> (default for MySQL 4.0 and onwards)

<LI><CODE>--with-berkeley-db</CODE> (not available on all platforms)

<LI><CODE>--with-raid</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-libwrap</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-named-z-libs</CODE> (This is done for some of the binaries)

<LI><CODE>--with-debug[=full]</CODE>

</UL>

<LI>

The default binary distribution is normally compiled with support
for all character sets and should work on a variety of processors from
the same processor family.

If you want a faster MySQL server you may want to recompile it
with support for only the character sets you need, use a better compiler
(like <CODE>pgcc</CODE>), or use compiler options that are better optimised for your
processor.

<LI>

If you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL
development team you will probably receive a patch that you need to apply to
the source distribution to get the bug fixed.

<LI>

If you want to read (and/or modify) the C and C++ code that makes up
MySQL, you should get a source distribution.  The source code is
always the ultimate manual.  Source distributions also contain more
tests and examples than binary distributions.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL naming scheme uses release numbers that consist of three
numbers and a suffix.  For example, a release name like
<CODE>mysql-4.1.0-alpha</CODE> is interpreted like this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first number (<CODE>4</CODE>) is the major version and also describes the
file format.  All Version 4 releases have the same file format.

<LI>

The second number (<CODE>1</CODE>) is the release level.

<LI>

The third number (<CODE>0</CODE>) is the version number within the
release level.  This is incremented for each new distribution.  Usually you
want the latest version for the release level you have chosen.

<LI>

The suffix (<CODE>alpha</CODE>) indicates the stability level of the release.
The possible suffixes are:


<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>alpha</CODE> indicates that the release contains some large section of
new code that hasn't been 100% tested.  Known bugs (usually there are none)
should be documented in the News section.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>.  There are also new
commands and extensions in most alpha releases.  Active development that
may involve major code changes can occur on an alpha release, but everything
will be tested before doing a release.  There should be no known bugs in any
MySQL release.

<LI>

<CODE>beta</CODE> means that all new code has been tested.  No major new
features that could cause corruption on old code are added.  There should
be no known bugs.  A version changes from alpha to beta when there
haven't been any reported fatal bugs within an alpha version for at least
a month and we don't plan to add any features that could make any old command
more unreliable.

<LI>

<CODE>gamma</CODE> is a beta that has been around a while and seems to work fine.
Only minor fixes are added.  This is what many other companies call a release.

<LI>

If there is no suffix, it means that the version has been run for a
while at many different sites with no reports of bugs other than
platform-specific bugs.  Only critical bug fixes are applied to the
release. This is what we call a production (stable) release.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
In the MySQL development process, multiple versions co-exist and are at a
different stage. Naturally, relevant bugfixes from an earlier series
also propagate upward.

<UL>
<LI>

For the old stable/production series <CODE>3.23</CODE>, new versions are only 
released for critical bugs.
<LI>

The current series <CODE>4.0</CODE>) is stable/production quality, with new
versions released for bugfixes. No new features are added that could
influence the code stability.
<LI>

In the alpha branch <CODE>4.1</CODE> major new features are added. Sources
and binaries are available for use and testing on development systems.
<LI>

The development branch <CODE>5.0</CODE> is only available from the BitKeeper
tree.
</UL>

<P>
All versions of MySQL are run through our standard tests and
benchmarks to ensure that they are relatively safe to use.  Because the
standard tests are extended over time to check for all previously found bugs,
the test suite keeps getting better.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>

</P>
<P>
Note that all releases have been tested at least with:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>An internal test suite
<DD>
This is part of a production system for a customer.  It has many tables with
hundreds of megabytes of data.

<DT>The MySQL benchmark suite
<DD>
This runs a range of common queries.  It is also a test to see whether the
latest batch of optimisations actually made the code faster.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<DT>The <CODE>crash-me</CODE> test
<DD>
This tries to determine what features the database supports and what its
capabilities and limitations are.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.
</DL>

<P>
Another test is that we use the newest MySQL version in our internal
production environment, on at least one machine.  We have more than 100
gigabytes of data to work with.

Within an installation directory, the layout of a source installation differs
from that of a binary installation in the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is installed in the <TT>`libexec'</TT>
directory rather than in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory.

<LI>

The data directory is <TT>`var'</TT> rather than <TT>`data'</TT>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> is installed in the <TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT> directory
rather than in <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/scripts'</TT>.

<LI>

The header file and library directories are <TT>`include/mysql'</TT> and
<TT>`lib/mysql'</TT> rather than <TT>`include'</TT> and <TT>`lib'</TT>.
</UL>

<P>
You can create your own binary installation from a compiled source
distribution by executing the script <TT>`scripts/make_binary_distribution'</TT>.

<H3><A NAME="Many_versions" HREF="manual_toc.html#Many_versions">2.2.8  How and When Updates Are Released</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL is evolving quite rapidly here at MySQL AB and we
want to share this with other MySQL users.  We try to make a release
when we have very useful features that others seem to have a need for.

</P>
<P>
We also try to help out users who request features that are easy to
implement.  We take note of what our licensed users want to have, and
we especially take note of what our extended e-mail supported customers
want and try to help them out.

</P>
<P>
No one has to download a new release.  The News section will tell you if
the new release has something you really want.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>.

</P>
<P>
We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For each minor update, the last number in the version string is incremented.
When there are major new features or minor incompatibilities with previous
versions, the second number in the version string is incremented.  When the
file format changes, the first number is increased.

<LI>

Production (stable-tested) releases are meant to appear about 1-2 times a year,
but if small bugs are found, a release with only bug fixes will be released.

<LI>

Working releases/bug fixes to old releases are meant to appear about
every 1-8 weeks.

<LI>

Binary distributions for some platforms will be made by us for major releases.
Other people may make binary distributions for other systems but probably
less frequently.

<LI>

We usually make patches available as soon as we have located and fixed
small bugs. They usually
are immediately available from our public BitKeeper repositories. They will
also be included in the next release.

<LI>

Non-critical but annoying bugs will be added to the MySQL source
repository and they will be fixed in the next release.

<LI>

If there is, by any chance, a fatal bug in a release we will make a new
release as soon as possible.  We would like other companies to do this,
too.
</UL>

<P>
The current production release is Version 4.0; we have already moved active
development to Version 4.1 and 5.0.  Bugs will still be fixed in the 4.0
version, and critical bugs also in the 3.23 series.
We don't believe in a complete freeze, as this also leaves out bug fixes
and things that ``must be done.''  ``Somewhat frozen'' means that we may
add small things that ``almost surely will not affect anything that's
already working.''

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses a slightly different naming scheme from most other products.
In general it's relatively safe to use any version that has been out for
a couple of weeks without being replaced with a new version.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_version">2.2.6  Which MySQL Version to Use</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Release_philosophy" HREF="manual_toc.html#Release_philosophy">2.2.9  Release Philosophy - No Known Bugs in Releases</A></H3>

<P>
We put a lot of time and effort into making our releases bug free.
To our knowledge, we have not released a single MySQL version with any
<EM>known</EM> 'fatal' repeatable bugs.

</P>
<P>
A fatal bug is something that crashes MySQL under normal usage,
gives wrong answers for normal queries, or has a security problem.

</P>
<P>
We have documented all open problems, bugs and things that are
dependent on design decisions.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.7.6  Known Errors and Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
Our aim is to fix everything that is fixable, but without risking
making a stable MySQL version less stable. In certain cases, this
means we can fix an issue in the development version(s), but not
in the stable (production) version. Naturally, we document such
issues so that users are aware.

</P>
<P>
Here is a description of how our build process works:

<UL>
<LI>

We monitor bugs from our customer support list, the MySQL external
mailing lists and the bugs database at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.
<LI>

All reported bugs for live versions are entered into the bugs database.
<LI>

When we fix a bug, we always try to make a test case of it and
include this into our test system to ensure that the bug will never
come back. (About 90% of all fixed bugs have a test case.)
<LI>

We also create test cases for all new features we add to MySQL.
<LI>

Before we start to build a new MySQL release, we ensure that all
reported repeatable bugs for the MySQL version (3.23.x, 4.0.x, etc)
are fixed.  If something is impossible to fix (because some internal
design decision in MySQL) we document this in the manual.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.7.6  Known Errors and Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

We do a build on all platforms for which we support binaries (15+
platforms) and run our test suite and benchmark suite on all of them.
<LI>

We will not publish a binary for a platform for which the test or
benchmark suite fails.  If it's a general error in the source, we fix
this and do the build plus tests on all systems again, from scratch.
<LI>

If we, during the build and test process (which takes 2-3 days),
receive a report regarding a fatal bug (for example, one that causes
a core dump), we fix this and restart the build process.
<LI>

After publishing the binaries on <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>, we send
out an announce email on the <CODE>mysql</CODE> and
<CODE>announce</CODE> mailing lists.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
The announcement message contains a list
of all changes to the release and any known problems with the release.
(The 'known problems' section in the release notes has only been needed
in a handful of releases.)
<LI>

To quickly give our users access to the latest MySQL features, we do
a new MySQL release every 4-5 weeks.
<LI>

If we, after the release is done, get any bug reports that there was
(after all) anything critically wrong with the build on a specific
platform, we will fix this at once and build a new <CODE>'a'</CODE> release
for that platform. Thanks to our large user base, problems are found
quickly.
<LI>

Our track record for making good releases is quite good.  In the last
150 releases, we had to do a new build for less than 10 releases (in 3
of these cases, the bug was a faulty glibc library on one of our build
machines that took us a long time to track down).
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>

</P>
<P>
As a service, we at MySQL AB provide a set of binary distributions
of MySQL that are compiled at our site or at sites where customers
kindly have given us access to their machines. 

</P>
<P>
In addition to the binaries provided in platform-specific package formats
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#Quick_Standard_Installation">2.1  Quick Standard Installation of MySQL</A>), we do offer binary distributions
for a number of platforms by means of compressed tar archives
(<CODE>.tar.gz</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
These distributions are generated using the script
<CODE>Build-tools/Do-compile</CODE> which compiles the source code and creates the
binary <CODE>tar.gz</CODE> archive using <CODE>scripts/make_binary_distribution</CODE>
These binaries are configured and built with the following compilers and
options.

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Quick_Standard_Installation">2.1  Quick Standard Installation of MySQL</A> for more information on how to install
these.

</P>
<P>
The generic MySQL binary distributions are packaged as gzip-compressed
GNU tar archives (<CODE>.tar.gz</CODE>). You need the following tools to
install a MySQL binary distribution:

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>gunzip</CODE> to uncompress the distribution.

<LI>

A reasonable <CODE>tar</CODE> to unpack the distribution. GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> is
known to work. Some <CODE>tar</CODE> implementations that come pre-installed
with the operating system (e.g. Sun <CODE>tar</CODE>) are known to have problems
(with long file names, for example). In that case, you should install
GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> first.

<P>
If you run into problems, <STRONG>please always use <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE></STRONG> when
posting questions to a MySQL mailing list.  Even if the problem
isn't a bug, <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> gathers system information that will help others
solve your problem.  By not using <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>, you lessen the likelihood

The basic commands you must execute to install and use a MySQL
binary distribution are:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; groupadd mysql
shell&#62; useradd -g mysql mysql
shell&#62; cd /usr/local
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
shell&#62; ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql

shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; chown -R root  .
shell&#62; chown -R mysql data
shell&#62; chgrp -R mysql .
shell&#62; bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If your version of MySQL is older than 4.0, substitute <CODE>bin/safe_mysqld</CODE>
for <CODE>bin/mysqld_safe</CODE> in the final command.

You can add new users using the <CODE>bin/mysql_setpermission</CODE> script if
you install the <CODE>DBI</CODE> and <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> Perl modules.

</P>
<P>
A more detailed description follows.

</P>
<P>
To install a binary distribution, follow these steps, then proceed
to section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>, for post-installation setup and testing:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution, and move
into it. In the following example, we unpack the distribution under
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT> (The following instructions, therefore, assume you have
permission to create files and directories in <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.
If that directory is protected, you will need to perform the installation as
<CODE>root</CODE>.)

<LI>

Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_MySQL">2.2.1  How to Get MySQL</A>.

MySQL binary distributions are provided as compressed <CODE>tar</CODE>
archives and have names like <TT>`mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz'</TT>, where
<CODE>VERSION</CODE> is a number (for example, <CODE>3.21.15</CODE>), and <CODE>OS</CODE>
indicates the type of operating system for which the distribution is intended
(for example, <CODE>pc-linux-gnu-i586</CODE>).
Note that all binaries are built from the same MySQL source distribution.

<LI>

Add a user and group for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; groupadd mysql
shell&#62; useradd -g mysql mysql
</PRE>

These commands add the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user.  The
syntax for <CODE>useradd</CODE> and <CODE>groupadd</CODE> may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix.  They may also be called <CODE>adduser</CODE> and <CODE>addgroup</CODE>.
You may wish to call the user and group something else instead of <CODE>mysql</CODE>.

<LI>

Change into the intended installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /usr/local
</PRE>

<LI>

Unpack the distribution, which will create the installation directory.
Then create a symbolic link to that directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
shell&#62; ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
</PRE>

Using GNU tar, you can also replace the first line with the following
alternative command to decompress and extract the distribution in one go:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
</PRE>

The first command creates a directory named <TT>`mysql-VERSION-OS'</TT>.  The
second command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This lets you refer
more easily to the installation directory as <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql
</PRE>

You will find several files and subdirectories in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> directory.
The most important for installation purposes are the <TT>`bin'</TT> and
<TT>`scripts'</TT> subdirectories.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`bin'</TT>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
This directory contains client programs and the server
You should add the full pathname of this directory to your
<CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
programs properly. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

<DT><TT>`scripts'</TT>
<DD>
This directory contains the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script used to initialise
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database containing the grant tables that store the server
access permissions.
</DL>

<LI>

If you would like to use <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> and have the MySQL
distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the location where
<CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> expects to find the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  Edit the
<TT>`bin/mysqlaccess'</TT> script at approximately line 18.  Search for a line
that looks like this:


<PRE>
$MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable
</PRE>

Change the path to reflect the location where <CODE>mysql</CODE> actually is
stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a <CODE>Broken
pipe</CODE> error when you run <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.

<LI>

Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
installed MySQL before):

<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
MySQL server when you run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  This is no
longer true.

<LI>

Change ownership of binaries to <CODE>root</CODE> and ownership of the data
directory to the user that you will run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql/.
shell&#62; chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
shell&#62; chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/.
</PRE>

The first command changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the files to the
<CODE>root</CODE> user, the second one changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the
data directory to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user, and the third one changes the
<CODE>group</CODE> attribute to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group.

<LI>

If you want to install support for the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_support">2.7  Perl Installation Comments</A>.

<LI>

If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
machine, you can copy <CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> to the location where
your system has its startup files.  More information can be found in the
<CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> script itself and in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.

</OL>

<P>
After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should initialise
and test your distribution.

</P>
<P>
You can start the MySQL server with the following command:

</P>

<PRE>

</P>
<P>
You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>gunzip</CODE> to uncompress the distribution.

<LI>

A reasonable <CODE>tar</CODE> to unpack the distribution. GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> is
known to work. Some <CODE>tar</CODE> implementations that come pre-installed
with the operating system (e.g. Sun <CODE>tar</CODE>) are known to have problems
(with long file names, for example). In that case, you should install
GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> first.

<LI>

A working ANSI C++ compiler.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> &#62;= 2.95.2, <CODE>egcs</CODE> &#62;= 1.0.2
or <CODE>egcs 2.91.66</CODE>, SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the
compilers that are known to work.  <CODE>libg++</CODE> is not needed when
using <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible
to compile some perfectly legal C++ files, such as
<TT>`sql/sql_base.cc'</TT>.  If you only have <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.x, you must
upgrade your <CODE>gcc</CODE> to be able to compile MySQL. <CODE>gcc</CODE>
2.8.1 is also known to have problems on some platforms, so it should be
avoided if a new compiler exists for the platform.

<CODE>gcc</CODE> &#62;= 2.95.2 is recommended when compiling MySQL
Version 3.23.x.

<LI>

A good <CODE>make</CODE> program.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> is always recommended and is
sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
<CODE>make</CODE> 3.75 or newer.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using a recent version of <CODE>gcc</CODE>, recent enough to understand the
<CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> option, it is <STRONG>very important</STRONG> that you use
it. Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We also
recommend that you use <CODE>-felide-constructors</CODE> and <CODE>-fno-rtti</CODE> along
with <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE>. When in doubt, do the following:

</P>

<PRE>

CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
       -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
       --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

</PRE>

<P>
On most systems this will give you a fast and stable binary.

</P>
<P>
If you run into problems, <STRONG>please always use <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE></STRONG> when
posting questions to a MySQL mailing list.  Even if the problem
isn't a bug, <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> gathers system information that will help others
solve your problem.  By not using <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>, you lessen the likelihood
of getting a solution to your problem.  You will find <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> in the
<TT>`scripts'</TT> directory after you unpack the distribution.

<P>
If your version of MySQL is older than 4.0, substitute <CODE>bin/safe_mysqld</CODE>
for <CODE>bin/mysqld_safe</CODE> in the final command.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have support for InnoDB tables, you should edit the
<CODE>/etc/my.cnf</CODE> file and remove the <CODE>#</CODE> character before the
parameter that starts with <CODE>innodb_...</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>, and section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.3  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.

<P>
Some of the more commonly-used <CODE>configure</CODE> options are described here:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
not the server, use the <CODE>--without-server</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --without-server
</PRE>

If you don't have a C++ compiler, <CODE>mysql</CODE> will not compile (it is the
one client program that requires C++).  In this case,
you can remove the code in <CODE>configure</CODE> that tests for the C++ compiler
and then run <CODE>./configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--without-server</CODE> option. The
compile step will still try to build <CODE>mysql</CODE>, but you can ignore any
warnings about <TT>`mysql.cc'</TT>.  (If <CODE>make</CODE> stops, try <CODE>make -k</CODE>
to tell it to continue with the rest of the build even if errors occur.)

<LI>

If you want to get an embedded MySQL library (<CODE>libmysqld.a</CODE>) you should
use the <CODE>--with-embedded-server</CODE> option.

<LI>

If you don't want your log files and database directories located under
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>, use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command, something like one
of these:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
           --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data
</PRE>

The first command changes the installation prefix so that everything is
installed under <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> rather than the default of
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.  The second command preserves the default installation
prefix, but overrides the default location for database directories
(normally <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>) and changes it to
<CODE>/usr/local/mysql/data</CODE>.  After you have compiled MySQL, you can
change these options with option files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<LI>

If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket located somewhere
other than the default location (normally in the directory <TT>`/tmp'</TT> or
<TT>`/var/run'</TT>) use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock
</PRE>

Note that the given file must be an absolute pathname.
You can also later change the location <TT>`mysql.sock'</TT> by using the MySQL
option files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.

If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to make a
binary distribution, to get more speed, or to work around problems with some
Red Hat Linux distributions), run <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:


<PRE>

If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> and don't have <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>
installed, you can tell <CODE>configure</CODE> to use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++
compiler:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure
</PRE>

When you use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++ compiler, it will not attempt to link in
<CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  This may be a good idea to do even if you
have the above libraries installed, as some versions of these libraries have
caused strange problems for MySQL users in the past.

Here are some common environment variables to set depending on
the compiler you are using:

The binaries we provide on the MySQL web site at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a> are all compiled with full optimisation and
should be perfect for most users.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_binaries">2.2.10  MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB</A>.  There are some
things you can tweak to make an even faster binary, but this is only for
advanced users.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compile_and_link_options">5.5.3  How Compiling and Linking Affects the Speed of MySQL</A>.

If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or linker not
being able to create the shared library <TT>`libmysqlclient.so.#'</TT> (<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>
is a version number), you can work around this problem by giving the
<CODE>--disable-shared</CODE> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>.  In this case,
<CODE>configure</CODE> will not build a shared <TT>`libmysqlclient.so.#'</TT> library.

You can configure MySQL not to use <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> column values for
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> columns (that is, columns that are not allowed to be

By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set. To
change the default set, use the <CODE>--with-charset</CODE> option:

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET
</PRE>

<CODE>CHARSET</CODE> may be one of <CODE>big5</CODE>, <CODE>cp1251</CODE>, <CODE>cp1257</CODE>,
<CODE>czech</CODE>, <CODE>danish</CODE>, <CODE>dec8</CODE>, <CODE>dos</CODE>, <CODE>euc_kr</CODE>,

<CODE>usa7</CODE>, or <CODE>win1251ukr</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

If you want to convert characters between the server and the client,
you should take a look at the <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: If you change character sets after having created any
tables, you will have to run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q --set-character-set=charset</CODE>
on every table. Your
indexes may be sorted incorrectly otherwise.  (This can happen if you
install MySQL, create some tables, then reconfigure
MySQL to use a different character set and reinstall it.)

With the option <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=LIST</CODE> you can define
which additional character sets should be compiled into the server.

Here <CODE>LIST</CODE> is either a list of character
sets separated with spaces,
<CODE>complex</CODE> to include all characters that can't be dynamically loaded,
or <CODE>all</CODE> to include all character sets into the binaries.

<LI>

To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>
option:

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-debug
</PRE>

This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find some errors
and that provides output about what is happening.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<LI>

If your client programs are using threads, you need to also compile a
thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
<CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE> configure options. This will create a
<CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE> library with which you should link your threaded
applications.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">11.1.14  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.

<STRONG>Caution</STRONG>: You should read this section only if you are interested
in helping us test our new code. If you just want to get MySQL up
and running on your system, you should use a standard release distribution
(either a source or binary distribution will do).

</P>
<P>
To obtain our most recent development source tree, use these instructions:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Download <CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> from
<a HREF="http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi">http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi</a>.  You will need
<CODE>Bitkeeper</CODE> 3.0 or newer to access our repository.

<LI>

Follow the instructions to install it.

<LI>

After <CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> is installed, first go to the directory you
want to work from, and then use one of the following commands to clone
the MySQL version branch of your choice:

To clone the 3.23 (old) branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-3.23 mysql-3.23
</PRE>

To clone the 4.0 (stable/production) branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.0 mysql-4.0
</PRE>

To clone the 4.1 alpha branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1
</PRE>

To clone the 5.0 development branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-5.0 mysql-5.0
</PRE>

In the preceding examples the source tree will be set up in the
<TT>`mysql-3.23/'</TT>, <TT>`mysql-4.0/'</TT>, <TT>`mysql-4.1/'</TT>, or <TT>`mysql-5.0/'</TT>
subdirectory of your current directory.

If you are behind a firewall and can only initiate HTTP connections,
you can also use <CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> via HTTP.

If you are required to use a proxy server, simply set the environment
variable <CODE>http_proxy</CODE> to point to your proxy:


<PRE>
shell&#62; export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/"
</PRE>

Now, simply replace the <CODE>bk://</CODE> with <CODE>http://</CODE> when doing
a clone. Example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone http://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1
</PRE>

The initial download of the source tree may take a while, depending on the
speed of your connection - please be patient.

<LI>

You will need <STRONG>GNU</STRONG> <CODE>make</CODE>, <CODE>autoconf 2.53 (or newer)</CODE>,
<CODE>automake 1.5</CODE>, <CODE>libtool 1.4</CODE>, and <CODE>m4</CODE> to run the next
set of commands. Even though many operating system already come with their
own implementation of <CODE>make</CODE>, chances are high that the compilation
fails with strange error messages. Therefore it is highly recommended to
use GNU <CODE>make</CODE> (sometimes also named <CODE>gmake</CODE>) by all means.

Fortunately, a large number of operating systems already ship with the GNU
toolchain preinstalled or supply installable packages of these. In any case,
they can also be downloaded from the following locations:


<UL>
<LI>

http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

</UL>

If you are trying to configure MySQL 4.1, you will also need GNU
<CODE>bison 1.75</CODE>.  Older versions of <CODE>bison</CODE> may report this error:
<CODE>sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767)
exceeded</CODE>. Note: the maximum table size is not actually exceeded,
the error is caused by bugs in these earlier <CODE>bison</CODE> versions.

Versions of MySQL before version 4.1 may also compile with other
<CODE>yacc</CODE> implementations (e.g. BSD <CODE>yacc</CODE> 91.7.30). For later
versions, GNU <CODE>bison</CODE> is a requirement.

The typical command to do in a shell is:


<PRE>
cd mysql-4.0
bk -r edit
aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake
(cd innobase; aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake) # for InnoDB
(cd bdb/dist; sh s_all ) # for Berkeley DB
./configure  # Add your favorite options here
make
</PRE>

If you get some strange error during this stage, check that you really
have <CODE>libtool</CODE> installed.

A collection of our standard configure scripts is located in the
<TT>`BUILD/'</TT> subdirectory.  If you are lazy, you can use
<TT>`BUILD/compile-pentium-debug'</TT>. To compile on a different architecture,
modify the script by removing flags that are Pentium-specific.

<LI>

When the build is done, run <CODE>make install</CODE>.  Be careful with this
on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live release
installation.  If you have another installation of MySQL, we
recommend that you run <CODE>./configure</CODE> with different values for the
<CODE>prefix</CODE>, <CODE>with-tcp-port</CODE>, and <CODE>unix-socket-path</CODE> options than
those used for your production server.

<LI>

Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new features
crash.  Start by running <CODE>make test</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_test_suite">13.1.2  MySQL Test Suite</A>.

<LI>

If you have gotten to the <CODE>make</CODE> stage and the distribution does
not compile, please report it in our bugs database at
<a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.  If you
have installed the latest versions of the required GNU tools, and they
crash trying to process our configuration files, please report that also.
However, if you execute <CODE>aclocal</CODE> and get a <CODE>command not found</CODE>
error or a similar problem, do not report it.  Instead, make sure all
the necessary tools are installed and that your <CODE>PATH</CODE> variable is
set correctly so that your shell can find them.

<LI>

After the initial <CODE>bk clone</CODE> operation to get the source tree, you
should run <CODE>bk pull</CODE> periodically to get the updates.

<LI>

You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs by using
<CODE>bk sccstool</CODE>.  If you see some funny diffs or code that you have a
question about, do not hesitate to send e-mail to the MySQL internals mailing
list.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
Also, if you think you have a better idea
on how to do something, send an e-mail to the same address with a patch.
<CODE>bk diffs</CODE> will produce a patch for you after you have made changes
to the source. If you do not have the time to code your idea, just send
a description.

<LI>

<CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> has a nice help utility that you can access via
<CODE>bk helptool</CODE>.

<LI>

Please note that any commits (<CODE>bk ci</CODE> or <CODE>bk citool</CODE>) will
trigger the posting of a message with the changeset to our internals
mailing list, as well as the usual openlogging.org submission with
just the changeset comments.
Generally, you wouldn't need to use commit (since the public tree will
not allow <CODE>bk push</CODE>), but rather use the <CODE>bk diffs</CODE> method
described previously.

If <CODE>configure</CODE> is run after it already has been run, it may use
information that was gathered during its previous invocation.  This
information is stored in <TT>`config.cache'</TT>.  When <CODE>configure</CODE> starts
up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on the
assumption that the information is still correct.  That assumption is invalid
when you reconfigure.

<LI>

Each time you run <CODE>configure</CODE>, you must run <CODE>make</CODE> again
to recompile.  However, you may want to remove old object files from previous
builds first because they were compiled using different configuration options.

<P>
To prevent old configuration information or object files from being used,
run these commands before rerunning <CODE>configure</CODE>:

If you get errors when compiling <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>, such as the ones shown
here, you have probably run out of memory or swap space:


<PRE>
Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
  or
Out of virtual memory
  or
Virtual memory exhausted
</PRE>

The problem is that <CODE>gcc</CODE> requires huge amounts of memory to compile
<TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> with inline functions.  Try running <CODE>configure</CODE> with
the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-low-memory
</PRE>

This option causes <CODE>-fno-inline</CODE> to be added to the compile line if you
are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> and <CODE>-O0</CODE> if you are using something else.  You
should try the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option even if you have so much
memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have run out.  This
problem has been observed to occur even on systems with generous hardware
configurations, and the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option usually fixes it.

<LI>

By default, <CODE>configure</CODE> picks <CODE>c++</CODE> as the compiler name and
GNU <CODE>c++</CODE> links with <CODE>-lg++</CODE>.  If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
that behaviour can cause problems during configuration such as this:

<A NAME="IDX259"></A>

<PRE>
configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
C++ compiler cannot create executables.
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX260"></A>
<A NAME="IDX261"></A>
You might also observe problems during compilation related to
<CODE>g++</CODE>, <CODE>libg++</CODE>, or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.

One cause of these problems is that you may not have <CODE>g++</CODE>, or you may
have <CODE>g++</CODE> but not <CODE>libg++</CODE>, or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  Take a look at
the <TT>`config.log'</TT> file.  It should contain the exact reason why your C++
compiler didn't work.  To work around these problems, you can use <CODE>gcc</CODE>
as your C++ compiler.  Try setting the environment variable <CODE>CXX</CODE> to
<CODE>"gcc -O3"</CODE>.  For example:

<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure
</PRE>

This works because <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiles C++ sources as well as <CODE>g++</CODE>
does, but does not link in <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> by default.

Another way to fix these problems, of course, is to install <CODE>g++</CODE>,
<CODE>libg++</CODE>, and <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  We would however like to recommend
you to not use <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> with MySQL as this will
only increase the binary size of mysqld without giving you any benefits.
Some versions of these libraries have also caused strange problems for
MySQL users in the past.

<A NAME="IDX264"></A>
<A NAME="IDX265"></A>
Using <CODE>gcc</CODE> as the C++ compiler is also required, if you want to
compile MySQL with RAID functionality (see section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> for more info
on RAID table type) and you are using GNU <CODE>gcc</CODE> version 3 and above. If
you get errors like the ones below during the linking stage when you
configure MySQL to compile with the option <CODE>--with-raid</CODE>, try to use
<CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++ compiler by defining the above mentioned environment
variable <CODE>CXX</CODE>:


<PRE>

If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers, do so by
adding the flags to the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> environment
variables.  You can also specify the compiler names this way using <CODE>CC</CODE>
and <CODE>CXX</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CC=gcc
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-O3
shell&#62; CXX=gcc
shell&#62; CXXFLAGS=-O3
shell&#62; export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_binaries">2.2.10  MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB</A>, for a list of flag definitions that have been found
to be useful on various systems.

<LI>

If you get an error message like this,
you need to upgrade your <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler:


<PRE>
client/libmysql.c:273: parse error before `__attribute__'
</PRE>

<CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.8.1 is known to work, but we recommend using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 or
<CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.0.3a instead.

<LI>

If you get errors such as those shown here when compiling <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
<CODE>configure</CODE> didn't correctly detect the type of the last argument to
<CODE>accept()</CODE>, <CODE>getsockname()</CODE>, or <CODE>getpeername()</CODE>:


<PRE>
cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
     type of the pointer value ''length'' is ''unsigned long'', which
     is not compatible with ''int''.
new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&#38;cAddr, &#38;length);
</PRE>

To fix this, edit the <TT>`config.h'</TT> file (which is generated by
<CODE>configure</CODE>).  Look for these lines:


<PRE>
/* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
#define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX
</PRE>

Change <CODE>XXX</CODE> to <CODE>size_t</CODE> or <CODE>int</CODE>, depending on your
operating system.  (Note that you will have to do this each time you run
<CODE>configure</CODE> because <CODE>configure</CODE> regenerates <TT>`config.h'</TT>.)

<LI>

The <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> file is generated from <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT>.  Normally
the build process doesn't need to create <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>, because
MySQL comes with an already generated copy.  However, if you do need
to re-create it, you might encounter this error:


<PRE>
"sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...
</PRE>

This is a sign that your version of <CODE>yacc</CODE> is deficient.
You probably need to install <CODE>bison</CODE> (the GNU version of <CODE>yacc</CODE>)
and use that instead.

<LI>

If you need to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> or a MySQL client, run
<CODE>configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> option, then recompile and
link your clients with the new client library.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_client">E.2  Debugging a MySQL client</A>.

<LI>

If you get a compilation error on Linux (e.g. SuSE Linux 8.1 or Red Hat
Linux 7.3) similar to the following one:


<PRE>
libmysql.c:1329: warning: passing arg 5 of `gethostbyname_r' from incompatible pointer type
libmysql.c:1329: too few arguments to function `gethostbyname_r'
libmysql.c:1329: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
make[2]: *** [libmysql.lo] Error 1
</PRE>

By default, the <CODE>configure</CODE> script attempts to determine the correct
number of arguments by using <CODE>g++</CODE> the GNU C++ compiler. This test
yields wrong results, if <CODE>g++</CODE> is not installed. There are two ways
to work around this problem:


<UL>
<LI>

Make sure that the GNU C++ <CODE>g++</CODE> is installed. On some Linux
distributions, the required package is called <CODE>gpp</CODE>, on others it
is named <CODE>gcc-c++</CODE>.
<LI>

Use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++ compiler by setting the <CODE>CXX</CODE> environment
variable to <CODE>gcc</CODE>:

MySQL source directory. It will create a new subdirectory
<CODE>mit-pthreads</CODE>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

On most systems, you can force MIT-pthreads to be used by running
<CODE>configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--with-mit-threads</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-mit-threads
</PRE>

Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
MIT-pthreads because we want to minimise our changes to this code.

<LI>

The checks that determine whether to use MIT-pthreads occur only
during the part of the configuration process that deals with the server
code.  If you have configured the distribution using <CODE>--without-server</CODE>
to build only the client code, clients will not know whether
MIT-pthreads is being used and will use Unix socket connections by default.
Because Unix sockets do not work under MIT-pthreads on some platforms, this
means you will need to use <CODE>-h</CODE> or <CODE>--host</CODE> when you run client
programs.

<LI>

When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
disabled by default for performance reasons.  You can tell the server to use
system locking with the <CODE>--external-locking</CODE> option.  This is only
needed if you want to be able to run two MySQL servers against the same
datafiles (not recommended).

<LI>

Sometimes the pthread <CODE>bind()</CODE> command fails to bind to a socket without
any error message (at least on Solaris).  The result is that all connections
to the server fail.  For example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin version
mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'
</PRE>

The solution to this is to kill the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and restart it.
This has only happened to us when we have forced down the server and done
a restart immediately.

<LI>

With MIT-pthreads, the <CODE>sleep()</CODE> system call isn't interruptible with
<CODE>SIGINT</CODE> (break).  This is only noticeable when you run
<CODE>mysqladmin --sleep</CODE>.  You must wait for the <CODE>sleep()</CODE> call to
terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

<LI>

When linking, you may receive warning messages like these (at least on
Solaris); they can be ignored:


<PRE>
ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
    (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);

file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
    /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
</PRE>

<LI>

Some other warnings also can be ignored:


<PRE>
implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'
</PRE>

<LI>

We haven't gotten <CODE>readline</CODE> to work with MIT-pthreads.  (This isn't
needed, but may be interesting for someone.)

Once you've installed MySQL (from either a binary or source
distribution), you need to initialise the grant tables, start the server,
and make sure that the server works okay.  You may also wish to arrange
for the server to be started and stopped automatically when your system
starts up and shuts down.

</P>
<P>
Normally you install the grant tables and start the server like this
for installation from a source distribution:
<A NAME="IDX283"></A>
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
For a binary distribution (not RPM or pkg packages), do this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; ./scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script creates the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database
which will hold all database privileges, the <CODE>test</CODE> database which
you can use to test MySQL, and also privilege entries for the user that
runs <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and a <CODE>root</CODE> user.  The entries are
created without passwords.  The <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script starts the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.  (If your version of MySQL is older than 4.0,
use <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> rather than <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> will not overwrite any old privilege tables, so
it should be safe to run in any circumstances.  If you don't want to
have the <CODE>test</CODE> database you can remove it with <CODE>mysqladmin -u
root drop test</CODE> after starting the server.

</P>
<P>
Testing is most easily done from the top-level directory of the MySQL
distribution.  For a binary distribution, this is your installation directory
(typically something like <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>).  For a source
distribution, this is the main directory of your MySQL source tree.
<A NAME="IDX285"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the commands shown in this section and in the following
subsections, <CODE>BINDIR</CODE> is the path to the location in which programs
like <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> are installed.  For a
binary distribution, this is the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory within the
distribution.  For a source distribution, <CODE>BINDIR</CODE> is probably
<TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT>, unless you specified an installation directory
other than <TT>`/usr/local'</TT> when you ran <CODE>configure</CODE>.
<CODE>EXECDIR</CODE> is the location in which the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is
installed.  For a binary distribution, this is the same as
<CODE>BINDIR</CODE>.  For a source distribution, <CODE>EXECDIR</CODE> is probably
<TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT>.

<P>
Testing is described in detail:

<OL>
<LI>

If necessary, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and set up the initial
MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that determine how
users are allowed to connect to the server.  This is normally done with the
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script:


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Typically, <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> needs to be run only the first time you
install MySQL.  Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing
installation, you can skip this step.  (However, <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> is
quite safe to use and will not update any tables that already exist, so if
you are unsure of what to do, you can always run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.)

<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> creates six tables (<CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>, and <CODE>func</CODE>) in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  A description of the initial privileges is given in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.  Briefly, these privileges allow the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user to do anything, and allow anybody to create or use databases
with a name of <CODE>test</CODE> or starting with <CODE>test_</CODE>.

If you don't set up the grant tables, the following error will appear in the
log file when you start the server:

<A NAME="IDX287"></A>

<PRE>
mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'
</PRE>

This may also happen with a binary MySQL distribution if you
don't start MySQL by executing exactly <CODE>./bin/mysqld_safe</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

You might need to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE>.  However,
if you prefer, you can run the MySQL server as an unprivileged
(non-<CODE>root</CODE>) user, provided that the user can read and write files in
the database directory.  Instructions for running MySQL as an
unprivileged user are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A>.

If you have problems with <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_install_db">2.4.1  Problems Running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE></A>.

There are some alternatives to running the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
script as it is provided in the MySQL distribution:


<UL>
<LI>

You may want to edit <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> before running it, to change
the initial privileges that are installed into the grant tables.  This is
useful if you want to install MySQL on a lot of machines with the
same privileges.  In this case you probably should need only to add a few
extra <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> and <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>
tables.

<LI>

If you want to change things in the grant tables after installing them, you
can run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>, then use <CODE>mysql -u root mysql</CODE> to
connect to the grant tables as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user and issue
SQL statements to modify the grant tables directly.

<LI>

It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after they have
already been created.  You might want to do this if you've already installed
the tables but then want to re-create them after editing
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.
</UL>

For more information about these alternatives, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.

<LI>

Start the MySQL server like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; bin/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

If you have problems starting the server, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> to verify that the server is running.  The following
commands provide a simple test to check that the server is up and responding
to connections:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin version
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

The output from <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE> varies slightly depending on your
platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar to that shown here:


<PRE>

To get a feeling for what else you can do with <CODE>BINDIR/mysqladmin</CODE>,
invoke it with the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.

<LI>

Verify that you can shut down the server:
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<LI>

Verify that you can restart the server.  Do this using <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> or
by invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly.  For example:

<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqld_safe --log &#38;
</PRE>

If <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> fails, try running it from the MySQL
installation directory (if you are not already there).  If that doesn't work,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

<LI>

Run some simple tests to verify that the server is working.

There is also a benchmark suite in the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory (under the
MySQL installation directory) that you can use to compare how
MySQL performs on different platforms. The benchmark suite is written in
Perl, using the Perl DBI module to provide a database-independent interface
to the various databases. The following additional Perl modules are required
to run the benchmark suite:


<PRE>
DBI
DBD-mysql
Data-Dumper
Data-ShowTable
</PRE>

These modules can be obtained from CPAN <a HREF="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_installation">2.7.1  Installing Perl on Unix</A>.

The <TT>`sql-bench/Results'</TT> directory contains the results from many runs
against different databases and platforms.  To run all tests, execute these
commands:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd sql-bench
shell&#62; run-all-tests
</PRE>

If you don't have the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory, you are probably using an
RPM for a binary distribution.  (Source distribution RPMs include the
benchmark directory.)  In this case, you must first install the benchmark
suite before you can use it.  Beginning with MySQL Version 3.22,
there are benchmark RPM files named <TT>`mysql-bench-VERSION-i386.rpm'</TT> that
contain benchmark code and data.

If you have a source distribution, you can also run the tests in the
<TT>`tests'</TT> subdirectory. For example, to run <TT>`auto_increment.tst'</TT>, do
this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysql -vvf test &#60; ./tests/auto_increment.tst
</PRE>

The expected results are shown in the <TT>`./tests/auto_increment.res'</TT> file.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> doesn't install the grant tables</STRONG>
<DD>
You may find that <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> fails to install the grant
tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:


<PRE>
starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
mysql daemon ended
</PRE>

In this case, you should examine the log file very carefully.  The log
should be located in the directory <TT>`XXXXXX'</TT> named by the error message,
and should indicate why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> didn't start.  If you don't understand
what happened, include the log when you post a bug report using
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

<DT><STRONG>There is already a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon running</STRONG>
<DD>
In this case, you probably don't have to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> at
all.  You have to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> only once, when you install
MySQL the first time.

<DT><STRONG>Installing a second <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon doesn't work when one daemon is running</STRONG>
<DD>
This can happen when you already have an existing MySQL
installation, but want to put a new installation in a different place (for
example, for testing, or perhaps you simply want to run two installations at
the same time).  Generally the problem that occurs when you try to run the
second server is that it tries to use the same socket and port as the old one.
In this case you will get the error message: <CODE>Can't start server: Bind on
TCP/IP port: Address already in use</CODE> or <CODE>Can't start server: Bind on
unix socket...</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Multiple_servers">4.1.3  Running Multiple MySQL Servers on the Same Machine</A>.

<A NAME="IDX295"></A>
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>

If you don't have write access to create a socket file at the default place
(in <TT>`/tmp'</TT>) or permission to create temporary files in <TT>`/tmp,'</TT>
you will get an error when running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> or when
starting or using <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

You can specify a different socket and temporary directory as follows:

<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
<A NAME="IDX299"></A>
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
shell&#62; MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysqld.sock
shell&#62; export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.

<TT>`some_tmp_dir'</TT> should be the path to some directory for which you
have write permission. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

After this you should be able to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and start
the server with these commands:


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes immediately</STRONG>
<DD>
If you are running Red Hat Version 5.0 with a version of <CODE>glibc</CODE> older than
2.0.7-5, you should make sure you have installed all <CODE>glibc</CODE> patches.
There is a lot of information about this in the MySQL mail

<a HREF="http://lists.mysql.com/">http://lists.mysql.com/</a>.
Also, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Linux">2.6.2  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A>.

From <CODE>mysql</CODE>, manually execute the SQL commands in
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  Make sure you run <CODE>mysqladmin

If you are going to use tables that support transactions (InnoDB, BDB),

for the table types you plan to use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
Generally, you start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server in one of these ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>.  This script is used primarily at
system startup and shutdown, and is described more fully in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.

<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, which tries to determine the proper options
for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and then runs it with those options. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

<LI>

For Windows NT/2000/XP, please see section <A HREF="manual.html#NT_start">2.6.1.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT, 2000, or XP</A>.

<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly.
</UL>

<P>
When the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon starts up, it changes the directory to the
data directory.  This is where it expects to write log files and the pid
(process ID) file, and where it expects to find databases.

</P>
<P>
The data directory location is hardwired in when the distribution is
compiled.  However, if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> expects to find the data directory
somewhere other than where it really is on your system, it will not work
properly.  If you have problems with incorrect paths, you can find out
what options <CODE>mysqld</CODE> allows and what the default path settings are by
invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.  You can override the
defaults by specifying the correct pathnames as command-line arguments to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  (These options can be used with <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> as well.)

</P>
<P>
Normally you should need to tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> only the base directory under
which MySQL is installed.  You can do this with the <CODE>--basedir</CODE>
option.  You can also use <CODE>--help</CODE> to check the effect of changing path
options (note that <CODE>--help</CODE> <STRONG>must</STRONG> be the final option of the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> command).  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; EXECDIR/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --help
</PRE>

<P>
Once you determine the path settings you want, start the server without
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Whichever method you use to start the server, if it fails to start up
correctly, check the log file to see if you can find out why.  Log files
are located in the data directory (typically
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary distribution,
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source distribution, and
<TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> on Windows).  Look in the data directory for
files with names of the form <TT>`host_name.err'</TT> and
<TT>`host_name.log'</TT> where <CODE>host_name</CODE> is the name of your server
host.  Then check the last few lines of these files:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; tail host_name.err
shell&#62; tail host_name.log
</PRE>

<P>
Look for something like the following in the log file:

<P>
This means that you didn't start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE>
and Berkeley DB found something wrong with its log files when it
tried to recover your databases.  To be able to continue, you should
move away the old Berkeley DB log file from the database directory to
some other place, where you can later examine it.  The log files are
named <TT>`log.0000000001'</TT>, where the number will increase over time.

</P>
<P>
If you are running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with BDB table support and <CODE>mysqld</CODE> core
dumps at start this could be because of some problems with the BDB
recover log.  In this case you can try starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE>.  If this helps, then you should remove all
<TT>`log.*'</TT> files from the data directory and try starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
again.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error, it means that some other program (or another
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server) is already using the TCP/IP port or socket
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to use:

</P>

<PRE>
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
  or
Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...

<P>
Use <CODE>ps</CODE> to make sure that you don't have another <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
running.  If you can't find another server running, you can try to execute
the command <CODE>telnet your-host-name tcp-ip-port-number</CODE> and press
Enter a couple of times.  If you don't get an error message like
<CODE>telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused</CODE>,
something is using the TCP/IP port <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to use.

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is currently running, you can find out what path settings
it is using by executing this command:

<P>
If you get <CODE>Errcode 13</CODE>, which means <CODE>Permission denied</CODE>, when
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> this means that you didn't have the right to
read/create files in the MySQL database or log directory. In this case
you should either start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as the <CODE>root</CODE> user or change the
permissions for the involved files and directories so that you have the
right to use them.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> starts the server but you can't connect to it,
you should make sure you have an entry in <TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> that looks like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
</PRE>

<P>
This problem occurs only on systems that don't have a working thread
library and for which MySQL must be configured to use MIT-pthreads.

</P>
<P>
If you can't get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to start you can try to make a trace file
to find the problem. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> scripts can be used to start
the server automatically at system startup time. <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can also
be used to stop the server.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script can be used to start or stop the server
by invoking it with <CODE>start</CODE> or <CODE>stop</CODE> arguments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql.server start
shell&#62; mysql.server stop
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`share/mysql'</TT> directory
under the MySQL installation directory or in the <TT>`support-files'</TT>
directory of the MySQL source tree.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you use the Linux RPM package
(<CODE>MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm</CODE>), the <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script has
already been installed as <TT>`/etc/init.d/mysql'</TT> - you don't have to
install it manually. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Linux-RPM">2.1.2  Installing MySQL on Linux</A> for more information on the
Linux RPM packages.

</P>
<P>
On Mac OS X, you can install a separate MySQL Startup Item package to
enable the automatic startup of MySQL on system bootup.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mac_OS_X_installation">2.1.3  Installing MySQL on Mac OS X</A> for details.

</P>
<P>
Before <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> starts the server, it changes the directory to
the MySQL installation directory, then invokes <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.
You might need to edit <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> if you have a binary distribution
that you've installed in a non-standard location.  Modify it to <CODE>cd</CODE>
into the proper directory before it runs <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>. If you want the
server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate <CODE>user</CODE> line
to the <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> file, as shown later in this section.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql.server stop</CODE> brings down the server by sending a signal to it.
You can also take down the server manually by executing
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You need to add these start and stop commands to the appropriate places
in your <TT>`/etc/rc*'</TT> files when you want to start up MySQL automatically
on your server.

</P>
<P>
On most current Linux distributions, it is sufficient to copy the file
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> into the <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> directory (or
<TT>`/etc/rc.d/init.d'</TT> on older Red Hat systems). Afterwards, run the
following command to enable the startup of MySQL on system bootup:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; chkconfig --add mysql.server
</PRE>

<P>
On FreeBSD startup scripts generally should go in
<TT>`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/'</TT>. The <CODE>rc(8)</CODE> manual page also states that
scripts in this directory are only executed, if their basename matches the
shell globbing pattern <CODE>*.sh</CODE>. Any other files or directories present
within the directory are silently ignored. In other words, on FreeBSD you
should install the file <TT>`mysql.server'</TT> as
<TT>`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql.server.sh'</TT> to enable automatic startup.

</P>
<P>
As an alternative to the above, some operating systems also use
<TT>`/etc/rc.local'</TT> or <TT>`/etc/init.d/boot.local'</TT> to start additional
services on bootup. To start up MySQL using this method, you could append
something like the following to it:

</P>

<PRE>
/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &#38;'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX306"></A>
You can also add options for <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> in a global
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> file.  A typical <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> file might look like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
port=3306
user=mysql

[mysql.server]
basedir=/usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script understands the following options:
<CODE>datadir</CODE>, <CODE>basedir</CODE>, and <CODE>pid-file</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The following table shows which option groups each startup script
reads from option files:

Before you do an upgrade, you should back up your old databases.

</P>
<P>
You can always move the MySQL format files and datafiles between different
versions on the same architecture as long as you have the same base
version of MySQL. The current base version is 4. If you change the
character set when running MySQL,
you must run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q --set-character-set=charset</CODE> on all
tables.  Otherwise, your indexes may not be ordered correctly, because
changing the character set may also change the sort order.

</P>
<P>
If you are afraid of new versions, you can always rename your old
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to something like <CODE>mysqld-old-version-number</CODE>.
If your new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> then does something unexpected, you can simply
shut it down and restart with your old <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If, after an upgrade, you experience problems with recompiled client programs,
such as <CODE>Commands out of sync</CODE> or unexpected core dumps, you probably have
used an old header or library file when compiling your programs.  In this
case you should check the date for your <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> file and
<TT>`libmysqlclient.a'</TT> library to verify that they are from the new
MySQL distribution.  If not, please recompile your programs.

</P>
<P>
If problems occur, such as that the new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't want to
start or that you can't connect without a password, check that you don't
have some old <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file from your old installation.  You can
check this with: <CODE>program-name --print-defaults</CODE>.  If this outputs
anything other than the program name, you have an active <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file that will affect things.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the Perl <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>
module whenever you install a new release of MySQL. The same applies to other
MySQL interfaces as well, such as the Python <CODE>MySQLdb</CODE> module.

<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-4.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-4.0">2.5.1  Upgrading From Version 4.0 to 4.1</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>

</P>
<P>
Several visible things have changed between MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 4.1 to fix
some critical bugs and make MySQL more compatible with the ANSI SQL
standard. These changes may affect your applications.

</P>
<P>
Some of the 4.1 behaviours can be tested in 4.0 before performing
a full upgrade to 4.1. We have added to later MySQL 4.0 releases
(from 4.0.12 on) a <CODE>--new</CODE> startup option for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
This option gives you the 4.1
behaviour for the most critical changes.  You can also enable these behaviours
for a given client connection with the <CODE>SET @@new=1</CODE> command, or turn
them off if they are on with <CODE>SET @@new=0</CODE>.

</P>

<P>
If you believe that some of the 4.1 changes will affect you,
we recommend that before upgrading to 4.1, you download
the latest MySQL 4.0 version and run it with the <CODE>--new</CODE> option.
That way you can test the new behaviors in 4.0 to make sure that
your applications work with them. This will help you have a smooth
painless transition when you perform a full upgrade to 4.1 later.

</P>
<P>
The following list describes changes that may affect applications and that
you should watch out for when upgrading to version 4.1:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is now returned as a string in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE>
format.  (The <CODE>--new</CODE> option can be used from 4.0.12 on to
make a 4.0 server behave as 4.1 in this respect.)  If you want to have
the value returned as a number (like Version 4.0 does) you should add +0 to
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns when you retrieve them:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ts_col + 0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

Display widths for <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns are no longer supported.
For example, if you declare a column as <CODE>TIMESTAMP(10)</CODE>, the <CODE>(10)</CODE>
is ignored.

These changes were necessary for SQL standards compliance. In a future
version, a further change will be made (backward compatible with this
change), allowing the timestamp length to indicate the desired number of
digits for fractions of a second.

<LI>

Binary values such as <CODE>0xFFDF</CODE> now are assumed to be strings instead of
numbers.  This fixes some problems with character sets where it's
convenient to input a string as a binary value.  With this change,
you should use <CODE>CAST()</CODE> if you want to compare binary values
numerically as integers:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(0xFEFF AS UNSIGNED INTEGER) &#60; CAST(0xFF AS UNSIGNED INTEGER);
        -&#62; 0
</PRE>

If you don't use <CODE>CAST()</CODE>, a lexical string comparison will be done:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 0xFEFF &#60; 0xFF;
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

Using binary items in a numeric context or comparing them using the
<CODE>=</CODE> operator should work as before.  (The <CODE>--new</CODE> option can
be used from 4.0.13 on to make a 4.0 server behave as 4.1 in this respect.)

<LI>

For functions that produce a <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, or <CODE>TIME</CODE>
value, the result returned to the client now is fixed up to have a temporal
type. For example, in MySQL 4.1, you get this result:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST("2001-1-1" as DATETIME);
    -&#62; '2001-01-01 00:00:00'
</PRE>

In MySQL 4.0, the result is different:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST("2001-1-1" as DATETIME);
    -&#62; '2001-01-01'
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values no longer can be specified for <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
columns. (In 4.0, a <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value is silently ignored; in 4.1,
an error occurs).

<LI>

<CODE>SERIALIZE</CODE> is no longer a valid option value for the <CODE>sql_mode</CODE>
variable.  You should use <CODE>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE</CODE>
instead. <CODE>SERIALIZE</CODE> is no longer valid for the <CODE>--sql-mode</CODE> option
for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, either. Use <CODE>--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE</CODE>
instead.

<LI>

All tables and string columns now have a character set.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Charset">9  National Character Sets and Unicode</A>.
Character set information is displayed by
<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
(MySQL versions 4.0.6 and above can read the new dump files; older
versions cannot.)

<LI>

The table definition format used in <TT>`.frm'</TT> files
has changed slightly in 4.1.  MySQL 4.0 versions from 4.0.11 on can
read the new <TT>`.frm'</TT> format directly, but older versions cannot.
If you need to move tables from 4.1 to a version earlier than 4.0.11, you
should use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.6  <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.

<LI>

If you are running multiple servers on the same Windows machine, you should
use a different <CODE>--shared_memory_base_name</CODE> option on all machines.

<LI>

The interface to aggregated UDF functions has changed a bit. You must now
declare a <CODE>clear()</CODE> function for each aggregate function.

</UL>

<P>
In general, upgrading to 4.1 from an earlier MySQL version involves the
following steps:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Check the changes listed earlier in this section to see if there are any
that may affect your applications.

<LI>

Read the 4.1 news items to see what significant new features you can use in 4.1.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#News-4.1.x">D.2  Changes in release 4.1.x (Alpha)</A>.

<LI>

If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, please also see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_upgrading">2.5.8  Upgrading MySQL under Windows</A>.

<LI>

After upgrading,
update the grant tables to generate the new longer <CODE>Password</CODE>
column that is needed for secure handling of passwords.  The
procedure uses <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> and is described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

</UL>

<P>
The password hashing mechanism has changed in 4.1 to provide better
security, but this may cause compatibility problems if you still have
clients that use the client library from 4.0 or earlier.  (It is very likely that you will
have 4.0 clients in situations where clients connect from remote hosts
that have not yet upgraded to 4.1).  The following list indicates some
possible upgrade strategies.  They represent various tradeoffs between
the goal of compatibility with old clients and the goal of security.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Don't upgrade to 4.1. No behaviour will change, but of course you cannot
use any of the new features provided by the 4.1 client/server protocol,
either.  (MySQL 4.1 has an extended client/server protocol that offers
such features as prepared statements and multiple result sets.)
See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_Prepared_statements">11.1.4  C API Prepared Statements</A>.

<LI>

Upgrade to 4.1 and run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script
to widen the <CODE>Password</CODE> column in the <CODE>user</CODE> table so
that it can hold long password hashes.  But run the server with the
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option to provide backward compatibility that
allows pre-4.1 clients to continue to connect to their short-hash
accounts.
Eventually, when all your clients are upgraded to 4.1, you can stop using the
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> server option. You can also change the passwords for
your MySQL accounts to use the new more secure format.

<LI>

Upgrade to 4.1 and run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script to widen the
<CODE>Password</CODE> column in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  If you know that all clients
also have been upgraded to 4.1, don't run the server with the
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option.  Instead, change the passwords on all existing
accounts so that they have the new format.  A pure-4.1 installation
is the most secure.

</UL>

<P>
Further background on password hashing with respect to client authentication
and password-changing operations may be found in section <A HREF="manual.html#Password_hashing">4.2.11  Password Hashing in MySQL 4.1</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-3.23" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-3.23">2.5.2  Upgrading From Version 3.23 to 4.0</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>

</P>
<P>
In general, you should do the following when upgrading to 4.0 from an earlier
MySQL version:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

After upgrading,
update the grant tables to add new privileges and features.  The
procedure uses the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script and is described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

<LI>

Edit any MySQL startup scripts or configure files to not use any of the
deprecated options described later in this section.

<LI>

Convert your old <CODE>ISAM</CODE> files to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> files with the
<CODE>mysql_convert_table_format database</CODE> script. (This is a Perl script;
it requires that DBI be installed.) To convert the tables in a given database,
use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql_convert_table_format database db_name
</PRE>

Note that this should only be used if all tables in the given database
are <CODE>ISAM</CODE> or <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. To avoid converting tables
of other types to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, you can explicitly list the names
of your <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables after the database name on the command
line.  You can also issue a <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM</CODE>
statement for each <CODE>ISAM</CODE> table to convert it to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.

To find out the table type for a given table, use this statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'tbl_name';
</PRE>

<LI>

Ensure that you don't have any MySQL clients that use shared libraries
(like the Perl <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> mode). If you do, you should recompile
them, because the data structures used in <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> have changed.
The same applies to other MySQL interfaces as well, such as the Python
<CODE>MySQLdb</CODE> module.

</UL>

<P>
MySQL 4.0 will work even if you don't do the above, but you will not be
able to use the new security privileges that MySQL 4.0 and you may run
into problems when upgrading later to MySQL 4.1 or newer.  The <CODE>ISAM</CODE> file
format still works in MySQL 4.0 but it's deprecated and will be disabled
(not compiled in by default) in MySQL 4.1. <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables should be
used instead.

</P>
<P>
Old clients should work with a Version 4.0 server without any problems.

</P>
<P>
Even if you do the above, you can still downgrade to MySQL 3.23.52
or newer if you run into problems with the MySQL 4.0 series.  In
this case, you must use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> to dump any tables that
use full-text indexes and reload the dump file into the 3.23 server.
This is necessary because 4.0 uses a new format for full-text
indexing.

</P>
<P>
The following is a more complete list that tells what you must watch out
for when upgrading to version 4.0:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

MySQL 4.0 has a lot of new privileges in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To get these new privileges to work, you must update the grant tables.
The procedure is described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.
Until you do this, all
users have the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE>,
and <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> privileges. <CODE>SUPER</CODE> and <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE>
privileges take their value from <CODE>PROCESS</CODE>.
<CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE> and <CODE>REPLICATION CLIENT</CODE> take their
values from <CODE>FILE</CODE>.

If you have any scripts that create new users, you may want to change
them to use the new privileges.  If you are not using <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
commands in the scripts, this is a good time to change your scripts to use
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> instead of modifying the grant tables directly..

From version 4.0.2 on, the option <CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE> is deprecated
(and no longer does anything). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges_options">4.2.3  Startup Options for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Concerning Security</A>.

If you get <CODE>Access denied</CODE> errors for new users in version 4.0.2 and up, you
should check if you need some of the new grants that you didn't need
before.  In particular, you will need <CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE>
(instead of <CODE>FILE</CODE>) for new slaves.

<LI>

<TT>`safe_mysqld'</TT> is renamed to <TT>`mysqld_safe'</TT>.  For backward
compatibility, binary distributions will for some time include
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as a symlink to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

<LI>

InnoDB support is now included by default in binary distributions.
If you build MySQL from source, InnoDB is configured in by default.
If you do not use InnoDB and want to save memory when running a server
that has InnoDB support enabled, use the <CODE>--skip-innodb</CODE> server
startop option. To compile MySQL without InnoDB support, run <CODE>configure</CODE>
with the <CODE>--without-innodb</CODE> option.

<LI>

The startup parameters <CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE> and
<CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE> are now given in bytes
(they were given in megabytes before 4.0.3).

<LI>

External system locking of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>/<CODE>ISAM</CODE> files is now
turned off by default.  Your can turn this on by doing
<CODE>--external-locking</CODE>. (However, this is never needed for most users.)

<LI>

The following startup variables/options have been renamed:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

The old names still work in MySQL 4.0 but are deprecated.

<LI>

You have to use <CODE>SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=#</CODE> instead of
<CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=#</CODE>.

<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> startup options <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> and
<CODE>--enable-locking</CODE> were renamed to <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>
and <CODE>--external-locking</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> now returns an empty set if binary logging is not
enabled.

<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> now returns an empty set if slave is not initialised.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> now has the option <CODE>--temp-pool</CODE> enabled by default as this
gives better performance with some operating systems (most notably Linux).

<LI>

<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> and <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> columns now honour the
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> flag on storage (before, <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> was ignored for
these columns).

<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY col_name DESC</CODE> sorts <CODE>NULL</CODE> values last, as of
MySQL 4.0.11. In 3.23 and in earlier 4.0 versions, this was not
always consistent.

<LI>

<CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE> has two more columns (<CODE>Null</CODE> and <CODE>Index_type</CODE>)
than it had in 3.23.

<LI>

<CODE>CHECK</CODE>, <CODE>SIGNED</CODE>, <CODE>LOCALTIME</CODE> and <CODE>LOCALTIMESTAMP</CODE>
are now reserved words.

<LI>

The result of all bitwise operators (<CODE>|</CODE>, <CODE>&#38;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE>, and <CODE>~</CODE>)) is now unsigned.  This may cause problems if you
are using them in a context where you want a signed result.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.

<LI>

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: when you use subtraction between integer values where
one is of type <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, the result will be unsigned.  In other
words, before upgrading to MySQL 4.0, you should check your application
for cases where you are subtracting a value from an unsigned entity and
want a negative answer or subtracting an unsigned value from an
integer column. You can disable this behaviour by using the
<CODE>--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> option when starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.

<LI>

To use <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST (... IN BOOLEAN MODE)</CODE> with your tables,
you need to rebuild them with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE table_name USE_FRM</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LOCATE()</CODE> and <CODE>INSTR()</CODE> are case-sensitive if one of the
arguments is a binary string. Otherwise they are case-insensitive.

<LI>

<CODE>STRCMP()</CODE> now uses the current character set when doing comparisons,
which means that the default comparison behaviour now is case-insensitive.

<LI>

<CODE>HEX(string)</CODE> now returns the characters in <CODE>string</CODE> converted to
hexadecimal.  If you want to convert a number to hexadecimal, you should
ensure that you call <CODE>HEX()</CODE> with a numeric argument.

<LI>

In 3.23, <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</CODE> always had <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> enabled.
In 4.0.1, MySQL will stop (and possibly roll back) by default in case of
an error unless you specify <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>.

<LI>

The old C API functions <CODE>mysql_drop_db()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_create_db()</CODE>, and
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> are no longer supported unless you compile
MySQL with <CODE>CFLAGS=-DUSE_OLD_FUNCTIONS</CODE>.  However, it is preferable
to change client programs to use the new 4.0 API instead.

<LI>

In the <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structure, <CODE>length</CODE> and <CODE>max_length</CODE> have
changed from <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> to <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>. This should not
cause any problems, except that they may generate warning messages when
used as arguments in the <CODE>printf()</CODE> class of functions.

<LI>

You should use <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> when you want to delete all rows
from a table and you don't need to obtain a count of the number of rows that
were deleted.  (<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> returns a row count in 4.0,
and <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> is faster.)

<LI>

You will get an error if you have an active <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or
transaction when trying to execute <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP
DATABASE</CODE>.

<LI>

You should use integers to store values in <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> columns (instead
of using strings, as you did in MySQL 3.23).  Using strings will still
work, but using integers is more efficient.

<LI>

The format of <CODE>SHOW OPEN TABLES</CODE> has changed.

<LI>

Multi-threaded clients should use <CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_thread_end()</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">11.1.14  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.

<LI>

If you want to recompile the Perl <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> module, you must get
<CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> version 1.2218 or newer because older DBD modules
used the deprecated <CODE>mysql_drop_db()</CODE> call.
Version 2.1022 or newer is recommended.

<LI>

<CODE>RAND(seed)</CODE> returns a different random number series in 4.0 than in
3.23; this was done to further differentiate <CODE>RAND(seed)</CODE> and
<CODE>RAND(seed+1)</CODE>.

<LI>

The default type returned by <CODE>IFNULL(A,B)</CODE> is now set to be the
more 'general' of the types of <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>. (The general-to-specific
order is string, <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>).

<P>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL Version 3.23 supports tables of the new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> type and
the old <CODE>ISAM</CODE> type.  You don't have to convert your old tables to
use these with Version 3.23.  By default, all new tables will be created with
type <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> (unless you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the
<CODE>--default-table-type=isam</CODE> option). You can convert an <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
table to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> format with <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM</CODE>
or the Perl script <CODE>mysql_convert_table_format</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Version 3.22 and 3.21 clients will work without any problems with a Version
3.23 server.

</P>
<P>
The following list tells what you have to watch out for when upgrading to
Version 3.23:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All tables that use the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set must be fixed
with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

If you do a <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> on a symbolically-linked database, both the
link and the original database are deleted.  (This didn't happen in 3.22
because <CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect the availability of the
<CODE>readlink()</CODE> system call.)

<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> now works only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
For other table types, you can use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to optimise the table.
During <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, the table is now locked to prevent it from being
used by other threads.

<LI>

The MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE> is now by default started with the
option <CODE>--no-named-commands (-g)</CODE>. This option can be disabled with
<CODE>--enable-named-commands (-G)</CODE>. This may cause incompatibility problems in
some cases--for example, in SQL scripts that use named commands without a
semicolon.  Long format commands still work from the first line.

<LI>

Date functions that work on parts of dates (like <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>) will now
return 0 for <CODE>0000-00-00</CODE> dates. (In MySQL 3.22, these functions returned
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.)

<LI>

If you are using the <CODE>german</CODE> character sort order for <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
tables, you must repair them with <CODE>isamchk -r</CODE>, because we have made
some changes in the sort order.

<LI>

The default return type of <CODE>IF()</CODE> now depends on both arguments
and not only the first argument.

<LI>

<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns should not be used to store negative
numbers. The reason for this is that negative numbers caused problems
when wrapping from -1 to 0.  You should not store 0 in <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
columns, either; <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will complain about 0 values because
they may change if you dump and restore the table.  <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables is now handled at a lower level and is much
faster than before. In addition, for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, old numbers
are no longer reused, even if you delete rows from the table.

<LI>

<CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>, <CODE>ELSE</CODE>, <CODE>END</CODE>, <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>,
<CODE>INNER</CODE>, <CODE>RIGHT</CODE>, <CODE>THEN</CODE>, and <CODE>WHEN</CODE> are now reserved words.

<LI>

<CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> is now a true floating-point type and not a value with a
fixed number of decimals.

<LI>

When declaring columns using a <CODE>DECIMAL(length,dec)</CODE> type, the
<CODE>length</CODE> argument no longer includes a place for the sign or the
decimal point.

<LI>

A <CODE>TIME</CODE> string must now be of one of the following formats:
<CODE>[[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]</CODE> or
<CODE>[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> now compares strings using the same character comparison rules
as for the <CODE>=</CODE> operator.  If you require the old behaviour, you can
compile MySQL with the <CODE>CXXFLAGS=-DLIKE_CMP_TOUPPER</CODE> flag.

<LI>

<CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is now case-insensitive if neither of the strings are binary
strings.

<LI>

When you check or repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> (<TT>`.MYI'</TT>) tables, you should use
the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> statement or the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command. For
<CODE>ISAM</CODE> (<TT>`.ISM'</TT>) tables, use the <CODE>isamchk</CODE> command.

<LI>

If you want your <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> files to be compatible between
MySQL Version 3.22 and Version 3.23, you should not use the
<CODE>--opt</CODE> or <CODE>--all</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

<LI>

Check all your calls to <CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> to make sure there is a
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> before each format character.
(MySQL Version 3.22 and later already allowed this syntax.)

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_fetch_fields_direct()</CODE> is now a function (it used to be a macro) and
it returns a pointer to a <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_num_fields()</CODE> can no longer be used on a <CODE>MYSQL*</CODE> object (it's
now a function that takes a <CODE>MYSQL_RES*</CODE> value as an argument). With a
<CODE>MYSQL*</CODE> object, you should now use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> instead.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22, the output of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT ...</CODE> was
almost always sorted.  In Version 3.23, you must use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> to obtain sorted output.

<LI>

<CODE>SUM()</CODE> now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of 0 if
there are no matching rows. This is required by SQL-99.

<LI>

An <CODE>AND</CODE> or <CODE>OR</CODE> with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values will now return
<CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of 0. This mostly affects queries that use <CODE>NOT</CODE>
on an <CODE>AND/OR</CODE> expression as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> = <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LPAD()</CODE> and <CODE>RPAD()</CODE> now shorten the result string if it's longer
than the length argument.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-3.21" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-3.21">2.5.4  Upgrading from Version 3.21 to 3.22</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>

</P>
<P>
Nothing that affects compatibility has changed between versions 3.21 and 3.22.
The only pitfall is that new tables that are created with <CODE>DATE</CODE> type
columns will use the new way to store the date. You can't access these new
columns from an old version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After installing MySQL Version 3.22, you should start the new server
and then run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script. This will add the
new privileges that you need to use the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.  If you forget
this, you will get <CODE>Access denied</CODE> when you try to use <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>, or <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE>. The procedure for updating
the grant tables is described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The C API interface to <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> has changed.  If you have
an old client program that calls this function, you must place a <CODE>0</CODE> for
the new <CODE>db</CODE> argument (or recode the client to send the <CODE>db</CODE>
element for faster connections).  You must also call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE>
before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.  This change was done to allow
the new <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> function to save options in the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
handler structure.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variable <CODE>key_buffer</CODE> has been renamed to
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>, but you can still use the old name in your
startup files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-3.20" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-3.20">2.5.5  Upgrading from Version 3.20 to 3.21</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are running a version older than Version 3.20.28 and want to
switch to Version 3.21, you need to do the following:

</P>
<P>
You can start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Version 3.21 server with the
<CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to use it with clients from a Version 3.20
distribution.  In this case, the new client function <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>
will not return any server error, only <CODE>CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR</CODE> (but it
works for client errors), and the server uses the old pre-3.21 <CODE>password()</CODE>
checking rather than the new method.

</P>
<P>
If you are <STRONG>not</STRONG> using the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you will need to make the following changes:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

All client code must be recompiled. If you are using ODBC, you must get
the new <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> 2.x driver.

<LI>

The script <CODE>scripts/add_long_password</CODE> must be run to convert the
<CODE>Password</CODE> field in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table to <CODE>CHAR(16)</CODE>.

<LI>

All passwords must be reassigned in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table (to get 62-bit
rather than 31-bit passwords).

<LI>

The table format hasn't changed, so you don't have to convert any tables.

</UL>

<P>
MySQL Version 3.20.28 and above can handle the new <CODE>user</CODE> table
format without affecting clients. If you have a MySQL version earlier
than Version 3.20.28, passwords will no longer work with it if you convert the
<CODE>user</CODE> table. So to be safe, you should first upgrade to at least Version
3.20.28 and then upgrade to Version 3.21.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
The new client code works with a 3.20.x <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, so
if you experience problems with 3.21.x, you can use the old 3.20.x server
without having to recompile the clients again.

</P>
<P>
If you are not using the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
old clients will be unable to connect and will issue the following error
message:

</P>

<PRE>
ERROR: Protocol mismatch. Server Version = 10 Client Version = 9
</PRE>

<P>
The new Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface also supports the old
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> interface.  The only change you have to make if you use
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> is to change the arguments to the <CODE>connect()</CODE> function.
The new arguments are: <CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>database</CODE>, <CODE>user</CODE>,
and <CODE>password</CODE> (note that the <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>password</CODE> arguments
have changed places).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_DBI_Class">11.5.2  The <CODE>DBI</CODE> Interface</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following changes may affect queries in old applications:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<CODE>HAVING</CODE> must now be specified before any <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.

<LI>

The parameters to <CODE>LOCATE()</CODE> have been swapped.

<LI>

There are some new reserved words. The most notable are <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX319"></A>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some releases introduce changes to the structure of the grant tables
(the tables in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database)
to add new  privileges or features. To make sure that your grant tables
are current when you update to a new version of MySQL, you should update
your grant tables as well.

</P>
<P>
On Unix or Unix-like systems, update the grant tables by running the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql_fix_privilege_tables
</PRE>

<P>
You must run this script while the server is running. It attempts to
connect to the server running on the local host as <CODE>root</CODE>.
If your <CODE>root</CODE> account requires a password, indicate the password
on the command line.  For MySQL 4.1 and up, specify the password like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql_fix_privilege_tables --password=root_password
</PRE>

<P>
Prior to MySQL 4.1, specify the password like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql_fix_privilege_tables root_password
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script performs any actions
necessary to convert your grant tables to the current format. You
may see some <CODE>Duplicate column name</CODE> warnings as it runs; they
can be ignored.

</P>
<P>
After running the script, stop the server and restart it.

</P>
<P>
On Windows systems, there isn't an easy way to update the grant tables
until MySQL 4.0.15.  From version 4.0.15 on, MySQL distributions include a
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql</CODE> SQL script that you can run using
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  If your MySQL installation is located at
<TT>`C:\mysql'</TT>, the command looks like this (enter it all on one line):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql -f -u root -p mysql
           &#60; C:\mysql\scripts\mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql
</PRE>

<P>
If your installation is located in some other directory, adjust the
pathnames appropriately.

</P>
<P>
The command will prompt you for the <CODE>root</CODE> password; enter it
when prompted.

</P>
<P>
As with the Unix procedure, you may see some <CODE>Duplicate column name</CODE>
warnings as <CODE>mysql</CODE> processes the statements in the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql</CODE> script; they can be ignored.

</P>
<P>
After running the script, stop the server and restart it.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-to-arch" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-to-arch">2.5.7  Upgrading to Another Architecture</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX321"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL Version 3.23, you can copy the <TT>`.frm'</TT>,
<TT>`.MYI'</TT>, and <TT>`.MYD'</TT> files for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables between different
architectures that support the same floating-point format.  (MySQL takes care
of any byte-swapping issues.)
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL <CODE>ISAM</CODE> data and index files (<TT>`.ISD'</TT> and
<TT>`*.ISM'</TT>, respectively) are architecture-dependent and in some cases
OS-dependent.  If you want to move your applications to another machine
that has a different architecture or OS than your current machine, you
should not try to move a database by simply copying the files to the
other machine. Use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will create a file containing SQL statements.
You can then transfer the file to the other machine and feed it as input
to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.

</P>
<P>
Try <CODE>mysqldump --help</CODE> to see what options are available.
If you are moving the data to a newer version of MySQL, you should use
<CODE>mysqldump --opt</CODE> with the newer version to get a fast, compact dump.

</P>
<P>
The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database between two
machines is to run the following commands on the machine on which the
database is located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'other hostname' create db_name
shell&#62; mysqldump --opt db_name \
        | mysql -h 'other hostname' db_name
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow network,
you can use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name
shell&#62; mysqldump -h 'other hostname' --opt --compress db_name \
        | mysql db_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can also store the result in a file, then transfer the file to the
target machine and load the file into the database there.  For example,
you can dump a database to a file on the source machine like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip &#62; db_name.contents.gz
</PRE>

<P>
(The file created in this example is compressed.) Transfer the file
containing the database contents to the target machine and run these commands
there:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; db_name.contents.gz | mysql db_name
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX322"></A>
<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
You can also use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> to transfer
the database.
For big tables, this is much faster than simply using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
In the following commands, <CODE>DUMPDIR</CODE> represents the full pathname
of the directory you use to store the output from <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
First, create the directory for the output files and dump the database:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mkdir DUMPDIR
shell&#62; mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name
</PRE>

<P>
Then transfer the files in the <CODE>DUMPDIR</CODE> directory to some corresponding
directory on the target machine and load the files into MySQL
there:

</P>

</P>
<P>
When upgrading MySQL under Windows, please follow these steps:

</P>

<OL>

<LI>

Download the latest Windows distribution of MySQL.

<LI>

Choose a time of day with low usage, where a maintenance break is
acceptable.

<LI>

Alert the users that still are active about the maintenance break.

<LI>

Stop the running MySQL Server (for example, with <CODE>NET STOP mysql</CODE> if you
are running MySQL as a service, or with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> otherwise).

<LI>

Exit the <CODE>WinMySQLadmin</CODE> program if it is running.

<LI>

Run the installation script of the Windows distribution, by
clicking the "Install" button in WinZip and following the installation
steps of the script.

<LI>

You may either overwrite your old MySQL installation (usually located at
<TT>`C:\mysql'</TT>), or install it into a different directory, such as
<CODE>C:\mysql4</CODE>. Overwriting the old installation is recommended.

<LI>

The version of MySQL that is started as a service is determined by the
<CODE>basedir</CODE> parameter in the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file of your Windows
directory (for example, <CODE>C:\WINNT</CODE>).

<LI>

Restart the server (for example, with <CODE>NET START mysql</CODE> if you run MYSQL
as a service, or by invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly otherwise).

<LI>

Update the grant tables. The procedure is described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

</OL>

<P>
Possible error situations:

<PRE>
A system error has occurred.
System error 1067 has occurred.
The process terminated unexpectedly.
</PRE>

<P>
This cryptic error means that your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file (by default
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT>) contains an option that cannot be recognised by
MySQL. You can verify that this is the case by trying to restart MySQL
with the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file renamed, for example, to <TT>`my.cnf.old'</TT> to
prevent the server from using it.  Once you have verified it, you need to
identify which option is the culprit. Create a new <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file and
move parts of the old file to it (restarting the server after you move
each part) until you determine which part causes server startup to fail.

<H3><A NAME="Windows" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows">2.6.1  Windows Notes</A></H3>

<P>
This section describes using MySQL on Windows. This information
is also provided in the <TT>`README'</TT> file that comes with the
MySQL Windows distribution. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_installation">2.1.1  Installing MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
On Windows 95, 98, or Me, MySQL clients always connect to the server using
TCP/IP. On NT-based systems such as Windows NT, 2000, or XP, clients have two
options. They can use TCP/IP, or they can use a named pipe if the server
supports named pipe connections.

</P>

<P>
For information about which server binary to run, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_prepare_environment">2.1.1.2  Preparing the Windows MySQL Environment</A>.

</P>
<P>
The examples in this section assume that MySQL is installed under the default
location of <TT>`C:\mysql'</TT>. Adjust the pathnames shown in the examples if you
have MySQL installed in a different location.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Win95_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#Win95_start">2.6.1.1  Starting MySQL on Windows 95, 98, or Me</A></H4>

<P>
On these versions of Windows,
MySQL uses TCP/IP to connect a client to a server. (This will
allow any machine on your network to connect to your MySQL
server.)  Because of this, you must make sure that TCP/IP support is installed
on your machine before starting MySQL.  You can find TCP/IP on your
Windows CD-ROM.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using an old Windows 95 release (for example,
OSR2), it's likely that you have an old Winsock package;
MySQL requires Winsock 2! You can get the newest Winsock from
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</a>.  Windows 98 has the new Winsock 2
library, so it is unnecessary to update the library.

</P>
<P>
To start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, you should start a console window (a
``DOS'' window) and enter this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld
</PRE>

<P>
This will start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> in the background. That is, after the server
starts up, you should see another command prompt. (Note that if you start the
server this way on Windows NT, 2000, or XP, the server will run in the
foreground and the next command prompt will not appear until the server exits.
To run client programs while the server is running, you should open another
console window.)

</P>
<P>
You can stop the MySQL server by executing this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
This invokes the MySQL administrative utility <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> to connect
to the server as <CODE>root</CODE>, which is the default administrative account
in the MySQL grant system. Please note that users in the MySQL grant
system are wholly independent from any login users under Windows.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't start, please check the error log to see if the
server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the problem.
The error log is located in the <TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT> directory. It is
the file with a suffix of <TT>`.err'</TT>. You can also try to start the
server as <CODE>mysqld --console</CODE>; in this case, you may get some useful
information on the screen that may help solve the problem.

</P>
<P>
The last option is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--standalone --debug</CODE>.
In this case <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will write a log file
<TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT> that should contain the reason why
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't start. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
Use <CODE>mysqld --help</CODE> to display all the options that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> understands!

</P>



<H4><A NAME="NT_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#NT_start">2.6.1.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT, 2000, or XP</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to work with TCP/IP on Windows NT 4, you must install
service pack 3 (or newer)!

</P>
<P>
Normally you should install MySQL as a service on Windows NT/2000/XP.
In case the server was already running, first stop it using
the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
This invokes the MySQL administrative utility <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> to connect
to the server as <CODE>root</CODE>, which is the default administrative account
in the MySQL grant system. Please note that users in the MySQL grant
system are wholly independent from any login users under Windows.

</P>
<P>
Now install the server as a service:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install
</PRE>

<P>
The service is installed with the name <CODE>MySql</CODE>. Once
installed, it can be immediately started from the <CODE>Services</CODE>
utility, or by using the command <CODE>NET START MySql</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Once running, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be stopped by using the Services utility,
the command <CODE>NET STOP MySql</CODE>, or the command <CODE>mysqladmin
shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If any startup options are required, you can place them in the
<CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of any of the standard option files. As of MySQL
4.0.3, you can place options in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of any option
file and use a <CODE>--defaults-file</CODE> option to tell the server the name
of the file when you install the service. For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install MySql --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf
</PRE>

<P>
You can also specify options as ``<CODE>Start parameters</CODE>'' in the
Windows <CODE>Services</CODE> utility before you start the MySQL service.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>Services</CODE> utility
(<CODE>Windows Service Control Manager</CODE>) can be found in the
<CODE>Windows Control Panel</CODE> (under <CODE>Administrative Tools</CODE>
on Windows 2000). It is advisable to close the Services utility
while performing the <CODE>--install</CODE> or <CODE>--remove</CODE>
operations, this prevents some odd errors.

</P>
<P>
Please note that from MySQL version 3.23.44, you have the choice
of setting up the service as <CODE>Manual</CODE> instead (if you don't wish
the service to be started automatically during the boot process):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install-manual
</PRE>

<P>
When MySQL is running as a service, the operating system will automatically stop
the server on computer shutdown. In MySQL versions older than 3.23.47,
Windows waited only for a few seconds for the shutdown to complete, and
killed the database server process if the time limit was exceeded. This had
the potential to cause problems.  (For example, at the next startup the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> storage engine had to do crash recovery.) Starting from
MySQL version 3.23.48, Windows waits longer for the MySQL server
shutdown to complete. If you notice this still is not enough for your
installation, it is safest not to run the MySQL server as a service. Instead,
run it from the command-line prompt, and shut it down with
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There is a problem that Windows NT (but not Windows 2000/XP) by default only
waits 20 seconds for a service to shut down, and after that kills the
service process. You can increase this default by opening the Registry
Editor <TT>`\winnt\system32\regedt32.exe'</TT> and editing the value of
<CODE>WaitToKillServiceTimeout</CODE> at
<CODE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control</CODE>
in the Registry tree. Specify the new larger value in milliseconds
(for example, 120000 to have Windows NT wait up to 120 seconds).

</P>
<P>
Please note that when run as a service, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
has no access to a console and so no messages can be seen.
Errors can be checked in the error log, which is located in the
<TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT> directory. It is the file with a suffix of <TT>`.err'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems installing <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a
service using just the server name, try installing it using its full pathname:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install
</PRE>

<P>
If that doesn't work, you can get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to
start properly by fixing the path in the registry!

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service,
you can start it from the command line the same way as for Windows 95, 98, or
Me. For instructions, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Win95_start">2.6.1.1  Starting MySQL on Windows 95, 98, or Me</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms. The <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>
and <CODE>mysql-max-nt</CODE> servers support named pipes on NT, 2000, and XP.
The default is to use TCP/IP regardless of the platform, because named
pipes are actually slower than TCP/IP, and because some users have
experienced problems shutting down the MySQL server when named pipes
are used. Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled for
<CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> and <CODE>mysql-max-nt</CODE> if they are started with the
<CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE> option.

</P>

<P>
You can force a MySQL client to use named pipes by specifying the
<CODE>--pipe</CODE> option or by specifying <CODE>.</CODE> as the host name.  Use the
<CODE>--socket</CODE> option to specify the name of the pipe.
In MySQL 4.1, you should use the <CODE>--protocol=PIPE</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
You can test whether the MySQL server is working by executing any of the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root mysql
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin version status proc
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql test
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is slow to answer to connections on Windows 9x/Me, there is
probably a problem with your DNS.  In this case, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the
<CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> option and use only <CODE>localhost</CODE> and IP
numbers in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column of the MySQL grant tables.

</P>
<P>
There are two versions of the MySQL command-line tool:
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Binary</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql</CODE> </TD><TD> Compiled on native Windows, offering limited text editing capabilities.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqlc</CODE> </TD><TD> Compiled with the Cygnus GNU compiler and libraries, which offers <CODE>readline</CODE> editing.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
If you want to use <CODE>mysqlc</CODE>, you must have a copy of the
<TT>`cygwinb19.dll'</TT> library installed somewhere that <CODE>mysqlc</CODE> can find
it. If your distribution of MySQL doesn't have this library installed in the
same directory as <CODE>mysqlc</CODE> (the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory under the base
directory of your MySQL installation, look in the <CODE>lib</CODE> directory
to find it and copy it to your Windows system directory
(<TT>`\windows\system'</TT> or similar place).

</P>
<P>
The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges
to all databases without specifying a password.  To make MySQL
more secure, you should set a password for all users and remove the row in
the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table that has <CODE>Host='localhost'</CODE> and
<CODE>User=''</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should also add a password for the <CODE>root</CODE> user. The following
example starts by removing the anonymous user that has all privileges,
then sets a <CODE>root</CODE> user password:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql mysql
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
mysql&#62; QUIT
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin reload
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password your_password
</PRE>

<P>
After you've set the password, if you want to shut down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server, you can do so using this command:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; mysqladmin --user=root --password=your_password shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using the old shareware version of MySQL Version
3.21 under Windows, the above command will fail with an error:
<CODE>parse error near 'SET password'</CODE>.  The solution to this problem is to
upgrade to a newer version of MySQL.

</P>
<P>
With the current MySQL versions you can easily add new users
and change privileges with <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Here is a note about how to connect to get a secure connection to remote
MySQL server with SSH (by David Carlson <a HREF="mailto:dcarlson@mplcomm.com">dcarlson@mplcomm.com</a>):

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Install an SSH client on your Windows machine.  As a user, the best non-free
one I've found is from <CODE>SecureCRT</CODE> from <a HREF="http://www.vandyke.com/">http://www.vandyke.com/</a>.
Another option is <CODE>f-secure</CODE> from <a HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/">http://www.f-secure.com/</a>. You
can also find some free ones on <CODE>Google</CODE> at
<a HREF="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/">http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/</a>.

<LI>

Start your Windows SSH client.
Set <CODE>Host_Name = yourmysqlserver_URL_or_IP</CODE>.
Set <CODE>userid=your_userid</CODE> to log in to your server (probably not the same
as your MySQL login/password.

<LI>

Set up port forwarding. Either do a remote forward (Set <CODE>local_port: 3306</CODE>, <CODE>remote_host: yourmysqlservername_or_ip</CODE>, <CODE>remote_port: 3306</CODE> )
or a local forward (Set <CODE>port: 3306</CODE>,  <CODE>host: localhost</CODE>, <CODE>remote port: 3306</CODE>).

<LI>

Save everything, otherwise you'll have to redo it the next time.

<LI>

Log in to your server with SSH session you just created.

<LI>

On your Windows machine, start some ODBC application (such as Access).

<LI>

Create a new file in Windows and link to MySQL using the ODBC
driver the same way you normally do, except type in <CODE>localhost</CODE>
for the MySQL host server--not <CODE>yourmysqlservername</CODE>.

Beginning with MySQL Version 3.23.16, the <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>
and <CODE>mysql-max-nt</CODE> servers in the MySQL distribution are
compiled with the <CODE>-DUSE_SYMDIR</CODE> option.  This allows you to put a
database on a different disk by setting up a symbolic link to it
(in a manner similar to the way that symbolic links work on Unix).

</P>
<P>
On Windows, you make a symbolic link to a database by creating a file
that contains the path to the destination directory and saving this in
the data directory using the filename <TT>`db_name.sym'</TT>, where
<CODE>db_name</CODE> is the database name.  Note that the symbolic link
will not be used if a directory with the database name exists.

</P>
<P>
For example, if the MySQL data directory is <TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT>
and you want to have database <CODE>foo</CODE> located at <TT>`D:\data\foo'</TT>, you
should create the file <TT>`C:\mysql\data\foo.sym'</TT> that contains the
text <CODE>D:\data\foo\</CODE>.  After that, all tables created in the database
<CODE>foo</CODE> will be created in <TT>`D:\data\foo'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Note that because of the speed penalty you get when opening every table,
we have not enabled this by default even if you have compiled
MySQL with support for this. To enable symlinks you should put
in your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file the following entry:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]

In MySQL 4.0, symbolic links are enabled by default. If you don't need them,
you can disable them with the <CODE>skip-symbolic-links</CODE> option.

MySQL for Windows has by now proven itself to be very stable. The Windows
version of MySQL has the same features as the corresponding Unix version,
with the following exceptions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Windows 95 and threads</STRONG>
<DD>
Windows 95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread creation.
Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you shouldn't
run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> for an extended time on Windows 95 if your server handles
many connections!  Other versions of Windows don't suffer from this bug.

<DT><STRONG>Concurrent reads</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL depends on the <CODE>pread()</CODE> and <CODE>pwrite()</CODE> calls to be
able to mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  Currently we use mutexes
to emulate <CODE>pread()</CODE>/<CODE>pwrite()</CODE>.  We will, in the long run,
replace the file level interface with a virtual interface so that we can
use the <CODE>readfile()</CODE>/<CODE>writefile()</CODE> interface on NT/2000/XP to
get more speed.
The current implementation limits the number of open files MySQL
can use to 1024, which means that you will not be able to run as many
concurrent threads on NT/2000/XP as on Unix.

<DT><STRONG>Blocking read</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL uses a blocking read for each connection, which
has the following implications:


<UL>
<LI>

A connection will not be disconnected automatically after 8 hours, as happens
with the Unix version of MySQL.

<LI>

If a connection hangs, it's impossible to break it without killing
MySQL.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> will not work on a sleeping connection.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> can't abort as long as there are sleeping
connections.
</UL>

We plan to fix this problem when our Windows developers have figured out a
nice workaround.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
You can't drop a database that is in use by some thread.

<DT><STRONG>Killing MySQL from the task manager</STRONG>
<DD>
You can't kill MySQL from the task manager or with the shutdown
utility in Windows 95.  You must take it down with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>Case-insensitive names</STRONG>
<DD>
Filenames are case-insensitive on Windows, so database and table names
are also case-insensitive in MySQL for Windows.  The only
restriction is that database and table names must be specified using the same
case throughout a given statement.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<DT><STRONG>The <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> directory character</STRONG>
<DD>
Pathname components in Windows 95 are separated by the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character,
which is also the escape character in MySQL.  If you are using <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> or <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, you must double the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>
character:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "C:\\tmp\\skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;
</PRE>

Alternatively, use Unix style filenames with <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> characters:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/tmp/skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG>Problems with pipes.</STRONG>
<DD>
Pipes doesn't work reliably in the Windows command-line prompt.  If the
pipe includes the character <CODE>^Z</CODE> / <CODE>CHAR(24)</CODE>, Windows will think it
has encountered end-of-file and abort the program.

This is mainly a problem when you try to apply a binary log as follows:


<PRE>
mysqlbinlog binary-log-name | mysql --user=root
</PRE>

If you get a problem applying the log and suspect it's because of an <CODE>^Z</CODE>
/ <CODE>CHAR(24)</CODE> character you can use the following workaround:


<PRE>
mysqlbinlog binary-log-file --result-file=/tmp/bin.sql
mysql --user=root --execute "source /tmp/bin.sql"
</PRE>

The latter command also can be used to reliably read in any SQL file
that may contain binary data.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Can't open named pipe</CODE> error</STRONG>
<DD>
If you use a MySQL 3.22 version on NT with the newest mysql-clients
you will get the following error:


<PRE>
error 2017: can't open named pipe to host: . pipe...
</PRE>

This is because the release version of MySQL uses named pipes on NT
by default.  You can avoid this error by using the <CODE>--host=localhost</CODE>
option to the new MySQL clients or create an option file
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> that contains the following information:


<PRE>
[client]
host = localhost
</PRE>

Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are enabled only if <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> or
<CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> is started with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Access denied for user</CODE> error</STRONG>
<DD>
If you get the error <CODE>Access denied for user: 'some-user@unknown'
to database 'mysql'</CODE> when accessing a MySQL server on the same
machine, this means that MySQL can't resolve your host name
properly.

To fix this, you should create a file <TT>`\windows\hosts'</TT> with the
following information:


<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
While you are executing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement, the table is locked
from usage by other threads.  This has to do with the fact that on Windows,
you can't delete a file that is in use by another threads.  (In the future,
we may find some way to work around this problem.)

<DT><STRONG><CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is in use by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table will
not work on Windows because the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> handler does the table mapping
hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't allow you
to drop files that are open, you first must flush all <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
tables (with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>) or drop the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table before
dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we introduce
<CODE>VIEW</CODE>s.
<DT><STRONG><CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> and <CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> and <CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE> options for
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> are ignored on Windows, because Windows doesn't support
symbolic links.

<P>
Here are some open issues for anyone who might want to help us with the Windows
release:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX337"></A>

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Add some nice start and shutdown icons to the MySQL installation.

<LI>

It would be really nice to be able to kill <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from the task manager.
For the moment, you must use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

<LI>

Port <CODE>readline</CODE> to Windows for use in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tool.

<LI>

GUI versions of the standard MySQL clients (<CODE>mysql</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>) would be nice.

<LI>

It would be nice if the socket read and write functions in <TT>`net.c'</TT> were
interruptible. This would make it possible to kill open threads with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> on Windows.

<LI>

Add macros to use the faster thread-safe increment/decrement methods
provided by Windows.
</UL>

<P>
Other Windows-specific issues are described in the <TT>`README'</TT> file that
comes with the Windows distribution of MySQL.

<H3><A NAME="Linux" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux">2.6.2  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A></H3>

<P>
The following notes regarding <CODE>glibc</CODE> apply only to the situation
when you build MySQL
yourself. If you are running Linux on an x86 machine, in most cases it is
much better for you to just use our binary. We link our binaries against
the best patched version of <CODE>glibc</CODE> we can come up with and with the
best compiler options, in an attempt to make it suitable for a high-load
server. So if you read the following text, and are in doubt about
what you should do, try our binary first to see if it meets your needs, and
worry about your own build only after you have discovered that our binary is
not good enough. In that case, we would appreciate a note about it, so we
can build a better binary next time. For a typical user, even for setups with
a lot of concurrent connections and/or tables exceeding the 2G limit, our
binary in most cases is the best choice.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses LinuxThreads on Linux.  If you are using an old
Linux version that doesn't have <CODE>glibc2</CODE>, you must install
LinuxThreads before trying to compile MySQL.   You can get
LinuxThreads at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: we have seen some strange problems with Linux 2.2.14 and
MySQL on SMP systems. If you have a SMP system, we recommend
you upgrade to Linux 2.4 as soon as possible.  Your system will be
faster and more stable by doing this.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>glibc</CODE> versions before and including Version 2.1.1 have
a fatal bug in <CODE>pthread_mutex_timedwait</CODE> handling, which is used
when you do <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  We recommend that you not use
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> before upgrading glibc.

</P>
<P>
If you plan to have 1000+ concurrent connections, you will need to make
some changes to LinuxThreads, recompile it, and relink MySQL against
the new <TT>`libpthread.a'</TT>.  Increase <CODE>PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX</CODE> in
<TT>`sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/local_lim.h'</TT> to 4096 and decrease
<CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> in <TT>`linuxthreads/internals.h'</TT> to 256 KB. The paths are
relative to the root of <CODE>glibc</CODE> Note that MySQL will not be
stable with around 600-1000 connections if <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> is the default
of 2 MB.

</P>
<P>
If MySQL can't open enough files,
or connections, it may be that you haven't configured Linux to handle
enough files.

</P>
<P>
In Linux 2.2 and onward, you can check the number of allocated
file handles by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
cat /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
cat /proc/sys/fs/super-max
</PRE>

<P>
If you have more than 16 MB of memory, you should add something like the
following to your init scripts (for example, <TT>`/etc/init.d/boot.local'</TT> on SuSE Linux):

</P>

<PRE>
echo 65536 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
echo 8192 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
echo 1024 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/super-max
</PRE>

<P>
You can also run the preceding commands from the command-line as root, but
these settings will be lost the next time your computer reboots.

</P>
<P>
Alternatively, you can set these parameters on bootup by using the
<CODE>sysctl</CODE> tool, which is used by many Linux distributions (SuSE has
added it as well, beginning with SuSE Linux 8.0). Just put the following
values into a file named <TT>`/etc/sysctl.conf'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
# Increase some values for MySQL
fs.file-max = 65536
fs.dquot-max = 8192
fs.super-max = 1024
</PRE>

<P>
You should also add the following to <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld_safe]
open-files-limit=8192
</PRE>

<P>
This should allow MySQL to create up to 8192 connections + files.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> constant in LinuxThreads controls the spacing of thread
stacks in the address space.  It needs to be large enough so that there will
be plenty of room for the stack of each individual thread, but small enough
to keep the stack of some threads from running into the global <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
data.  Unfortunately, the Linux implementation of <CODE>mmap()</CODE>, as we have
experimentally discovered, will successfully unmap an already mapped region
if you ask it to map out an address already in use, zeroing out the data
on the entire page, instead of returning an error.  So, the safety of
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> or any other threaded application depends on the "gentleman"
behaviour of the code that creates threads.  The user must take measures to
make sure the number of running threads at any time is sufficiently low for
thread stacks to stay away from the global heap.  With <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you
should enforce this "gentleman" behaviour by setting a reasonable value for
the <CODE>max_connections</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
If you build MySQL yourself and do not want to mess with patching
LinuxThreads, you should set <CODE>max_connections</CODE> to a value no higher
than 500.  It should be even less if you have a large key buffer,  large
heap tables, or some other things that make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> allocate a lot
of memory, or if you are running a 2.2 kernel with a 2G patch. If you are
using our binary or RPM version 3.23.25 or later, you can safely set
<CODE>max_connections</CODE> at 1500, assuming no large key buffer or heap tables
with lots of data.  The more you reduce <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> in LinuxThreads
the more threads you can safely create.  We recommend the values between
128K and 256K.

</P>
<P>
If you use a lot of concurrent connections, you may suffer from a "feature"
in the 2.2 kernel that penalises a process for forking or cloning a child
in an attempt to prevent a fork bomb attack.  This will cause MySQL
not to scale well as you increase the number of concurrent clients.  On
single-CPU systems, we have seen this manifested in a very slow thread
creation, which means it may take a long time to connect to MySQL
(as long as 1 minute), and it may take just as long to shut it down.  On
multiple-CPU systems, we have observed a gradual drop in query speed as
the number of clients increases.  In the process of trying to find a
solution, we have received a kernel patch from one of our users, who
claimed it made a lot of difference for his site.  The patch is available at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch</a>. We have
now done rather extensive testing of this patch on both development and
production systems.  It has significantly
improved <CODE>MySQL</CODE> performance without causing any problems and we now
recommend it to our users who are still running high-load servers on
2.2 kernels.  This issue has been fixed in the 2.4 kernel, so if you are not
satisfied with
the current performance of your system, rather than patching your 2.2 kernel,
it might be easier to just upgrade to 2.4, which will also give you a nice
SMP boost in addition to fixing this fairness bug.

</P>
<P>
We have tested MySQL on the 2.4 kernel on a 2-CPU machine and
found MySQL scales <STRONG>much</STRONG> better--there was virtually no slowdown
on queries throughput all the way up
to 1000 clients, and the MySQL scaling factor (computed as the ratio of
maximum throughput to the throughput with one client) was 180%.
We have observed similar results on a 4-CPU system--virtually no
slowdown as the number of
clients was increased up to 1000, and 300% scaling factor. So for a high-load
SMP server we would definitely recommend the 2.4 kernel at this point. We
have discovered that it is essential to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process with the
highest possible priority on the 2.4 kernel to achieve maximum performance.
This can be done by adding
<CODE>renice -20 $$</CODE> command to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>. In our testing on a
4-CPU machine, increasing the priority gave 60% increase in throughput with
400 clients.

</P>
<P>
We are currently also trying to collect
more information on how well <CODE>MySQL</CODE> performs on 2.4 kernel on 4-way and 8-way
systems. If you have access such a system and have done some benchmarks,
please send a mail to <a HREF="mailto:docs@mysql.com">docs@mysql.com</a> with the results - we will
include them in the manual.

</P>
<P>
There is another issue that greatly hurts MySQL performance,
especially on SMP systems.  The implementation of mutex in
LinuxThreads in <CODE>glibc-2.1</CODE> is very bad for programs with many
threads that only
hold the mutex for a short time. On an SMP system, ironic as it is, if
you link MySQL against unmodified <CODE>LinuxThreads</CODE>,
removing processors from the machine improves MySQL performance
in many cases.  We have made a patch available for <CODE>glibc 2.1.3</CODE>
to correct this behaviour
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch</a>).

</P>
<P>
With <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE>
MySQL version 3.23.36 will use the adaptive mutex, which is much
better than even the patched one in <CODE>glibc-2.1.3</CODE>. Be warned, however,
that under some conditions, the current mutex code in <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE>
overspins, which hurts MySQL performance. The chance of this
condition can be reduced by renicing <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process to the highest
priority. We have also been able to correct the overspin behaviour with
a patch, available at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch</a>.
It combines the correction of overspin, maximum number of
threads, and stack spacing all in one. You will need to apply it in the
<CODE>linuxthreads</CODE> directory with
<CODE>patch -p0 &#60;/tmp/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch</CODE>.
We hope it will be included in
some form in to the future releases of <CODE>glibc-2.2</CODE>. In any case, if
you link against <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE> you still need to correct
<CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> and <CODE>PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX</CODE>. We hope that the defaults
will be corrected to some more acceptable values for high-load
MySQL setup in the future, so that your own build can be reduced
to <CODE>./configure; make; make install</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
We recommend that you use the above patches to build a special static
version of <CODE>libpthread.a</CODE> and use it only for statically linking
against <CODE>MySQL</CODE>. We know that the patches are safe for <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
and significantly improve its performance, but we cannot say anything
about other applications. If you link other applications against the
patched version of the library, or build a patched shared version and
install it on your system, you are doing it at your own risk with regard
to other applications that depend on <CODE>LinuxThreads</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you experience any strange problems during the installation of
MySQL, or with some common utilities hanging, it is very likely that
they are either library or compiler related. If this is the case, using our
binary will resolve them.

</P>
<P>
One known problem with the binary distribution is that with older Linux
systems that use <CODE>libc</CODE> (like Red Hat 4.x or Slackware), you will get
some non-fatal problems with hostname resolution.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_notes-Linux">2.6.2.1  Linux Notes for Binary Distributions</A>.

</P>
<P>
When using LinuxThreads you will see a minimum of three processes
running.  These are in fact threads.  There will be one thread for the
LinuxThreads manager, one thread to handle connections, and one thread
to handle alarms and signals.

</P>
<P>
Note that the Linux kernel and the LinuxThread library can by default
only have 1024 threads.  This means that you can only have up to 1021
connections to MySQL on an unpatched system.  The page
<a HREF="http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html">http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html</a> contains information how to
go around this limit.

</P>
<P>
If you see a dead <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon process with <CODE>ps</CODE>, this usually
means that you have found a bug in MySQL or you have a corrupted
table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get a core dump on Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies with a <CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE> signal,
you can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option.  Note
that you also probably need to raise the <CODE>core file size</CODE> by adding
<CODE>ulimit -c 1000000</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> or starting
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> with <CODE>--core-file-size=1000000</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

<P>
If you are linking your own MySQL client and get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.4:
open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
When executing them, the problem can be avoided by one of the following
methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Link the client with the following flag (instead of <CODE>-Lpath</CODE>):
<CODE>-Wl,r/path-libmysqlclient.so</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <CODE>libmysqclient.so</CODE> to <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX338"></A>
<A NAME="IDX339"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable before running your client.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using the Fujitsu compiler <CODE>(fcc / FCC)</CODE> you will have
some problems compiling MySQL because the Linux header files are very
<CODE>gcc</CODE> oriented.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>configure</CODE> line should work with <CODE>fcc/FCC</CODE>:

MySQL needs at least Linux Version 2.0.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>:
We have reports from some MySQL users that they have got serious
stability problems with MySQL with Linux kernel 2.2.14.  If you are
using this kernel you should upgrade to 2.2.19 (or newer) or to a 2.4
kernel.  If you have a multi-cpu box, then you should seriously consider
using 2.4 as this will give you a significant speed boost.

</P>
<P>
The binary release is linked with <CODE>-static</CODE>, which means you do not
normally need to worry about which version of the system libraries you
have. You need not install LinuxThreads, either.  A program linked with
<CODE>-static</CODE> is slightly bigger than a dynamically linked program but
also slightly faster (3-5%).  One problem, however, is that you can't use
user-definable functions (UDFs) with a statically linked program.  If
you are going to write or use UDFs (this is something for C or C++
programmers only), you must compile MySQL yourself, using dynamic linking.

</P>
<P>
If you are using a <CODE>libc</CODE>-based system (instead of a <CODE>glibc2</CODE>
system), you will probably get some problems with hostname resolving and
<CODE>getpwnam()</CODE> with the binary release. (This is because <CODE>glibc</CODE>
unfortunately depends on some external libraries to resolve hostnames
and <CODE>getpwent()</CODE>, even when compiled with <CODE>-static</CODE>). In this
case you probably get the following error message when you run
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up
</PRE>

<P>
or the following error when you try to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--user</CODE>
option:

</P>

<PRE>
getpwnam: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
You can solve this problem in one of the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Get a MySQL source distribution (an RPM or the <CODE>tar.gz</CODE>
distribution) and install this instead.
<LI>

Execute <CODE>mysql_install_db --force</CODE>; this will not execute the
<CODE>resolveip</CODE> test in <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  The downside is that
you can't use host names in the grant tables; you must use IP numbers
instead (except for <CODE>localhost</CODE>).  If you are using an old MySQL
release that doesn't support <CODE>--force</CODE>, you have to remove the
<CODE>resolveip</CODE> test in <CODE>mysql_install</CODE> with an editor.
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>su</CODE> instead of using <CODE>--user</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
The Linux-Intel binary and RPM releases of MySQL are configured
for the highest possible speed.  We are always trying to use the fastest
stable compiler available.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Perl support requires Version Perl 5.004_03 or newer.

</P>
<P>
On some Linux 2.2 versions, you may get the error <CODE>Resource
temporarily unavailable</CODE> when you do a lot of new connections to a
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server over TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
The problem is that Linux has a delay between when you close a TCP/IP
socket and until this is actually freed by the system.  As there is only
room for a finite number of TCP/IP slots, you will get the above error if
you try to do too many new TCP/IP connections during a small time, like
when you run the MySQL <TT>`test-connect'</TT> benchmark over
TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
We have mailed about this problem a couple of times to different Linux
mailing lists but have never been able to resolve this properly.

</P>
<P>
The only known 'fix' to this problem is to use persistent connections in
your clients or use sockets, if you are running the database server
and clients on the same machine.  We hope that the <CODE>Linux 2.4</CODE>
kernel will fix this problem in the future.

MySQL requires <CODE>libc</CODE> Version 5.4.12 or newer. It's known to
work with <CODE>libc</CODE> 5.4.46.  <CODE>glibc</CODE> Version 2.0.6 and later should
also work. There have been some problems with the <CODE>glibc</CODE> RPMs from
Red Hat, so if you have problems, check whether there are any updates.
The <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.0.7-19 and 2.0.7-29 RPMs are known to work.

</P>
<P>
If you are using Red Hat 8.0 or a new <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.2.x library, you should

(Use <CODE>-O thread_stack=192K</CODE> before MySQL 4.) If you don't do this,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will die in <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> because the new <CODE>glibc</CODE>
library requires a stack size greater than 128K for this call. This stack
size is now the default on MySQL 4.0.10 and above.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 3.0 and above to compile MySQL, you must install
the <CODE>libstdc++v3</CODE> library before compiling MySQL; if you don't do

<a HREF="http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/">http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/</a>.  By using these compilers,
instead of gcc, we get about 9-14% better performance with MySQL.

</P>
<P>
Note that until MySQL version 3.23.52 and 4.0.2 we optimised the binary for
the current CPU only (by using the <CODE>-fast</CODE> compile option); this meant
that you could only use our binaries if you had an Alpha EV6 processor.

</P>
<P>
Starting with all following releases we added the <CODE>-arch generic</CODE> flag
to our compile options, which makes sure the binary runs on all Alpha
processors. We also compile statically to avoid library problems.

</P>

<P>
Some known problems when running MySQL on Linux-Alpha:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Debugging threaded applications like MySQL will not work with
<CODE>gdb 4.18</CODE>.  You should download and use gdb 5.1 instead!

<LI>

If you try linking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> statically when using <CODE>gcc</CODE>, the
resulting image will core dump at start.  In other words, <STRONG>don't</STRONG>
use <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static</CODE> with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-PowerPC" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-PowerPC">2.6.2.5  Linux PowerPC Notes</A></H4>

<P>
MySQL should work on MkLinux with the newest <CODE>glibc</CODE> package
(tested with <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.0.7).

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-MIPS" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-MIPS">2.6.2.6  Linux MIPS Notes</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to work on Qube2, (Linux Mips), you need the
newest <CODE>glibc</CODE> libraries (<CODE>glibc-2.0.7-29C2</CODE> is known to
work).  You must also use the <CODE>egcs</CODE> C++ compiler
(<CODE>egcs-1.0.2-9</CODE>, <CODE>gcc 2.95.2</CODE> or newer).

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-IA-64" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-IA-64">2.6.2.7  Linux IA-64 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to compile on Linux IA-64, we use the following compile line:
Using <CODE>gcc-2.96</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
"--with-comment=Official MySQL binary" --with-extra-charsets=complex
</PRE>

<P>
On IA-64, the MySQL client binaries use shared libraries. This means
that if you install our binary distribution in some other place than
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> you need to add the path of the directory
where you have <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> installed either to the
<TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT> file or to the value of your <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
environment variable.

<A NAME="IDX346"></A>

</P>
<P>
On Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the MySQL
distribution unpacked!  Solaris <CODE>tar</CODE> can't handle long file names, so
you may see an error like this when you unpack MySQL:

</P>

<PRE>
x mysql-3.22.12-beta/bench/Results/ATIS-mysql_odbc-NT_4.0-cmp-db2,\
informix,ms-sql,mysql,oracle,solid,sybase, 0 bytes, 0 tape blocks
tar: directory checksum error
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, you must use GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> (<CODE>gtar</CODE>) to unpack the
distribution.  You can find a precompiled copy for Solaris at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-solaris.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-solaris.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
Sun native threads only work on Solaris 2.5 and higher.  For Version 2.4 and
earlier, MySQL will automatically use MIT-pthreads.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error from configure:

</P>

<PRE>
checking for restartable system calls... configure: error can not run test
programs while cross compiling
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you have something wrong with your compiler installation!
In this case you should upgrade your compiler to a newer version.  You may
also be able to solve this problem by inserting the following row into the
<TT>`config.cache'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls=${ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls='no'}
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using Solaris on a SPARC, the recommended compiler is
<CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 or 3.2. You can find this at <a HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a>.
Note that <CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.1 and <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.8.1 don't work reliably on
SPARC!

</P>
<P>
The recommended <CODE>configure</CODE> line when using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
If you have an UltraSPARC, you can get 4% more performance by adding
"-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

</P>
<P>
If you have Sun's Forte 5.0 (or newer) compiler, you can
run <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
You can create a 64 bit binary using Sun's Forte compiler with the
following compile flags:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt -xarch=v9" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt -xarch=v9" ASFLAGS="-xarch=v9" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
To create a 64bit Solaris binary using <CODE>gcc</CODE>, add <CODE>-m64</CODE> to
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE>. Note that this only works with MySQL
4.0 and up - MySQL 3.23 does not include the required modifications to
support this.

</P>
<P>
In the MySQL benchmarks, we got a 4% speedup on an UltraSPARC when using
Forte 5.0 in 32 bit mode compared to using gcc 3.2 with -mcpu flags.

</P>
<P>
If you create a 64 bit binary, it's 4 % slower than the 32 bit binary, but
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> can instead handle more treads and memory.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with <CODE>fdatasync</CODE> or <CODE>sched_yield</CODE>,
you can fix this by adding <CODE>LIBS=-lrt</CODE> to the configure line

</P>
<P>
The following paragraph is only relevant for older compilers than
WorkShop 5.3:

</P>
<P>
You may also have to edit the <CODE>configure</CODE> script to change this line:

</P>

<PRE>
#if !defined(__STDC__) || __STDC__ != 1
</PRE>

<P>
to this:

</P>

<PRE>
#if !defined(__STDC__)
</PRE>

<P>
If you turn on <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> with the <CODE>-Xc</CODE> option, the Sun compiler
can't compile with the Solaris <TT>`pthread.h'</TT> header file.  This is a Sun
bug (broken compiler or broken include file).

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> issues the error message shown here when you run it, you have
tried to compile MySQL with the Sun compiler without enabling the
multi-thread option (<CODE>-mt</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
libc internal error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held
</PRE>

<P>
Add <CODE>-mt</CODE> to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> and try again.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the SFW version of gcc (which comes with Solaris 8),
you must add <TT>`/opt/sfw/lib'</TT> to the environment variable
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> before running configure.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the gcc available from <CODE>sunfreeware.com</CODE>, you may
have many problems.  You should recompile gcc and GNU binutils on the
machine you will be running them from to avoid any problems.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error when compiling MySQL with <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
it means that your <CODE>gcc</CODE> is not configured for your version of Solaris:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gcc -O3 -g -O2 -DDBUG_OFF  -o thr_alarm ...
./thr_alarm.c: In function `signal_hand':
./thr_alarm.c:556: too many arguments to function `sigwait'
</PRE>

<P>
The proper thing to do in this case is to get the newest version of
<CODE>gcc</CODE> and compile it with your current <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler!  At
least for Solaris 2.5, almost all binary versions of <CODE>gcc</CODE> have
old, unusable include files that will break all programs that use
threads (and possibly other programs)!

</P>
<P>
Solaris doesn't provide static versions of all system libraries
(<CODE>libpthreads</CODE> and <CODE>libdl</CODE>), so you can't compile MySQL
with <CODE>--static</CODE>.  If you try to do so, you will get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found

or

undefined reference to `dlopen'

or

cannot find -lrt
</PRE>

<P>
If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you will
see this error in the MySQL log:

</P>

<PRE>
Error in accept: Protocol error
</PRE>

<P>
You might try starting the server with the <CODE>--set-variable back_log=50</CODE>
option as a workaround for this. Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is
deprecated since MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--back_log=50</CODE> on its own.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are linking your own MySQL client, you might get the
following error when you try to execute it:

</P>

<PRE>
ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#:
open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
The problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Link the client with the following flag (instead of <CODE>-Lpath</CODE>):
<CODE>-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <TT>`libmysqclient.so'</TT> to <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX347"></A>
<A NAME="IDX348"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable before running your client.
</UL>

<P>
If you have problems with configure trying to link with <CODE>-lz</CODE> and
you don't have <CODE>zlib</CODE> installed, you have two options:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to be able to use the compressed communication protocol,
you need to get and install zlib from ftp.gnu.org.

<LI>

Configure with <CODE>--with-named-z-libs=no</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using gcc and have problems with loading user defined functions
(<CODE>UDF</CODE>s) into MySQL, try adding <CODE>-lgcc</CODE> to the link line for the
<CODE>UDF</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
<TT>`support-files/mysql.server'</TT> to <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> and create a
symbolic link to it named <TT>`/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
As Solaris doesn't support core files for <CODE>setuid()</CODE> applications,
you can't get a core file from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> if you are using the
<CODE>--user</CODE> option.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Solaris_2.7" HREF="manual_toc.html#Solaris_2.7">2.6.3.1  Solaris 2.7/2.8 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
You can normally use a Solaris 2.6 binary on Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.  Most
of the Solaris 2.6 issues also apply for Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL Version 3.23.4 and above should be able to autodetect
new versions of Solaris and enable workarounds for the following problems!

</P>
<P>
Solaris 2.7 / 2.8 has some bugs in the include files.  You may see the
following error when you use <CODE>gcc</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/include/widec.h:42: warning: `getwc' redefined
/usr/include/wchar.h:326: warning: this is the location of the previous
definition
</PRE>

<P>
If this occurs, you can do the following to fix the problem:

</P>
<P>
Copy <CODE>/usr/include/widec.h</CODE> to
<CODE>.../lib/gcc-lib/os/gcc-version/include</CODE> and change line 41 from:

</P>

<PRE>
#if     !defined(lint) &#38;& !defined(__lint)

to

#if     !defined(lint) &#38;& !defined(__lint) &#38;& !defined(getwc)
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you can edit <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT> directly.  Either
way, after you make the fix, you should remove <TT>`config.cache'</TT> and run
<CODE>configure</CODE> again!

</P>
<P>
If you get errors like this when you run <CODE>make</CODE>, it's because
<CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect the <TT>`curses.h'</TT> file (probably
because of the error in <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
In file included from mysql.cc:50:
/usr/include/term.h:1060: syntax error before `,'
/usr/include/term.h:1081: syntax error before `;'
</PRE>

<P>
The solution to this is to do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Configure with <CODE>CFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H CXXFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H ./configure</CODE>.

<LI>

Edit <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT> as indicted above and rerun configure.

<LI>

Remove the <CODE>#define HAVE_TERM</CODE> line from <TT>`config.h'</TT> file and
run <CODE>make</CODE> again.
</UL>

<P>
If you get a problem that your linker can't find <CODE>-lz</CODE> when linking
your client program, the problem is probably that your <TT>`libz.so'</TT> file is
installed in <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>.  You can fix this by one of the
following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Add <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT> to <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>.

<LI>

Add a link to <TT>`libz.so'</TT> from <TT>`/lib'</TT>.

<LI>

If you are using Solaris 8, you can install the optional zlib from your
Solaris 8 CD distribution.

<LI>

Configure MySQL with the <CODE>--with-named-z-libs=no</CODE> option.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Solaris_x86" HREF="manual_toc.html#Solaris_x86">2.6.3.2  Solaris x86 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
On Solaris 8 on x86, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will dump core if you remove the
debug symbols using <CODE>strip</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>egcs</CODE> on Solaris x86 and you
experience problems with core dumps under load, you should use the
following <CODE>configure</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> library and with C++
exceptions.

</P>
<P>
If this doesn't help, you should compile a debug version and run
it with a trace file or under <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">E.1.3  Debugging mysqld under gdb</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="FreeBSD" HREF="manual_toc.html#FreeBSD">2.6.4.1  FreeBSD Notes</A></H4>

<P>
FreeBSD 4.x or newer is recommended for running MySQL since the thread
package is much more integrated.

</P>
<P>
The easiest and therefore the preferred way to install is to use the
mysql-server and mysql-client ports available on
<a HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">http://www.freebsd.org/</a>.

</P>
<P>
Using these gives you:

<UL>
<LI>

A working MySQL with all optimisations known to work on your version
of FreeBSD enabled.

<LI>

Automatic configuration and build.

<LI>

Startup scripts installed in /usr/local/etc/rc.d.

<LI>

Ability to see which files that are installed with pkg_info -L. And to
remove them all with pkg_delete if you no longer want MySQL on that
machine.
</UL>

<P>
It is recommended you use MIT-pthreads on FreeBSD 2.x and native threads on
Versions 3 and up. It is possible to run with native threads on some late
2.2.x versions but you may encounter problems shutting down <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, certain function calls on FreeBSD are not yet fully
thread-safe, most notably the <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE> function, which is
used by MySQL to convert host names into IP addresses. Under certain
circumstances, the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process will suddenly cause 100%
CPU load and will be unresponsive. If you encounter this, try to start
up MySQL using the <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Alternatively, you can link MySQL on FreeBSD 4.x against the LinuxThreads
library, which avoids a few of the problems that the native FreeBSD thread
implementation has. For a very good comparison of LinuxThreads vs. native
threads have a look at Jeremy Zawodny's article "FreeBSD or Linux for your
MySQL Server?" at
<a HREF="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000697.html">http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000697.html</a>

</P>
<P>
The known problems when using LinuxThreads on FreeBSD are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> is not working (probably signal handling problem in
FreeBSD/LinuxThreads).  This is supposed to get fixed in FreeBSD 5.0.
The symptom is that persistent connections can hang for <STRONG>a long</STRONG>
time without getting closed done.
</UL>

<P>
The MySQL <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s require GNU make (<CODE>gmake</CODE>) to work.  If
you want to compile MySQL you need to install GNU <CODE>make</CODE> first.

</P>
<P>
Be sure to have your name resolver setup correct.  Otherwise, you may
experience resolver delays or failures when connecting to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Make sure that the <CODE>localhost</CODE> entry in the <TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> file is
correct (otherwise, you will have problems connecting to the database).  The
<TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> file should start with a line:

</P>

<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.your.domain
</PRE>

<P>
The recommended way to compile and install MySQL on FreeBSD with
gcc (2.95.2 and up) is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-strength-reduce" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -felide-constructors \
-fno-strength-reduce" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
gmake
gmake install
./scripts/mysql_install_db
cd /usr/local/mysql
./bin/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you notice that <CODE>configure</CODE> will use MIT-pthreads, you should read
the MIT-pthreads notes.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get an error from <CODE>make install</CODE> that it can't find
<TT>`/usr/include/pthreads'</TT>, <CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect that you need
MIT-pthreads.  This is fixed by executing these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rm config.cache
shell&#62; ./configure --with-mit-threads
</PRE>

<P>
FreeBSD is also known to have a very low default file handle limit.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Not_enough_file_handles">A.2.17  File Not Found</A>.  Uncomment the <CODE>ulimit -n</CODE> section in
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> or raise the limits for the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> user in /etc/login.conf
(and rebuild it with cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf).  Also be sure you set the
appropriate class for this user in the password file if you are not
using the default (use: chpass mysqld-user-name).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have a lot of memory you should consider rebuilding
the kernel to allow MySQL to take more than 512M of RAM.
Take a look at <CODE>option MAXDSIZ</CODE> in the LINT config
file for more info.

</P>
<P>
If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the
<CODE>TZ</CODE> variable will probably help.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get a secure and stable system you should only use FreeBSD kernels
that are marked <CODE>-RELEASE</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="NetBSD" HREF="manual_toc.html#NetBSD">2.6.4.2  NetBSD Notes</A></H4>

Our users have reported that OpenBSD 2.8 has a threading bug which causes
problems with MySQL.  The OpenBSD Developers have fixed the problem,
but as of January 25th, 2001, it's only available in the ``-current'' branch.
The symptoms of this threading bug are: slow response, high load, high CPU
usage, and crashes.

</P>
<P>
If you get an error like <CODE>Error in accept:: Bad file descriptor</CODE> or
error 9 when trying to open tables or directories, the problem is probably
that you haven't allocated enough file descriptors for MySQL.

</P>
<P>
In this case, try starting <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE> with the following

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the

<H4><A NAME="BSDI3" HREF="manual_toc.html#BSDI3">2.6.4.6  BSD/OS Version 3.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
Upgrade to BSD/OS Version 3.1.  If that is not possible, install
BSDIpatch M300-038.

</P>
<P>
Use the following command when configuring MySQL:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; env CXX=shlicc++ CC=shlicc2 \
       ./configure \
           --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \

           --without-perl \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock
</PRE>

<P>
The following is also known to work:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; env CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
       ./configure \
           --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock
</PRE>

<P>
You can change the directory locations if you wish, or just use the
defaults by not specifying any locations.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with performance under heavy load, try using the
<CODE>--skip-thread-priority</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>!  This will run
all threads with the same priority; on BSDI Version 3.1, this gives better
performance (at least until BSDI fixes their thread scheduler).

</P>
<P>
If you get the error <CODE>virtual memory exhausted</CODE> while compiling,
you should try using <CODE>ulimit -v 80000</CODE> and run <CODE>make</CODE> again.
If this doesn't work and you are using <CODE>bash</CODE>, try switching to
<CODE>csh</CODE> or <CODE>sh</CODE>; some BSDI users have reported problems with
<CODE>bash</CODE> and <CODE>ulimit</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="BSDI4" HREF="manual_toc.html#BSDI4">2.6.4.7  BSD/OS Version 4.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
BSDI Version 4.x has some thread-related bugs.  If you want to use
MySQL on this, you should install all thread-related patches.  At
least M400-023 should be installed.

</P>
<P>
On some BSDI Version 4.x systems, you may get problems with shared libraries.
The symptom is that you can't execute any client programs, for example,
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.  In this case you need to reconfigure not to use
shared libraries with the <CODE>--disable-shared</CODE> option to configure.

</P>
<P>
Some customers have had problems on BSDI 4.0.1 that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
binary after a while can't open tables.  This is because some
library/system related bug causes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to change current
directory without asking for this!

</P>
<P>
The fix is to either upgrade to 3.23.34 or after running <CODE>configure</CODE>
remove the line <CODE>#define HAVE_REALPATH</CODE> from <CODE>config.h</CODE>
before running make.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above means that you can't symbolic link a database directories
to another database directory or symbolic link a table to another database
on BSDI!  (Making a symbolic link to another disk is okay).

<P>
<A NAME="IDX349"></A>
<A NAME="IDX350"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some of the binary distributions of MySQL for HP-UX are
distributed as an HP depot file and as a tar file.  To use the depot
file you must be running at least HP-UX 10.x to have access to HP's
software depot tools.

</P>
<P>
The HP version of MySQL was compiled on an HP 9000/8xx server
under HP-UX 10.20, and uses MIT-pthreads.  It is known to work well under
this configuration.  MySQL Version 3.22.26 and newer can also be
built with HP's native thread package.

</P>
<P>
Other configurations that may work:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20+
<LI>

HP 9000/8xx running HP-UX 10.30
</UL>

<P>
The following configurations almost definitely won't work:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 10.x where x &#60; 2
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 9.x
</UL>

<P>
To install the distribution, use one of the commands here, where
<CODE>/path/to/depot</CODE> is the full pathname of the depot file:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To install everything, including the server, client and development tools:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.full
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.server
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the client package:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.client
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the development tools:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.developer
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The depot places binaries and libraries in <TT>`/opt/mysql'</TT> and data in
<TT>`/var/opt/mysql'</TT>. The depot also creates the appropriate entries in
<TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> and <TT>`/etc/rc2.d'</TT> to start the server automatically
at boot time.  Obviously, this entails being <CODE>root</CODE> to install.

</P>
<P>
To install the HP-UX tar.gz distribution, you must have a copy of GNU
<CODE>tar</CODE>.

<P>
There are a couple of small problems when compiling MySQL on
HP-UX.  We recommend that you use <CODE>gcc</CODE> instead of the HP-UX native
compiler, because <CODE>gcc</CODE> produces better code!

</P>
<P>
We recommend using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95 on HP-UX.  Don't use high optimisation
flags (like -O6) as this may not be safe on HP-UX.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>configure</CODE> line should work with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95:

</P>

<PRE>

<H4><A NAME="HP-UX_11.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#HP-UX_11.x">2.6.6.3  HP-UX Version 11.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
For HP-UX Version 11.x, we recommend MySQL Version 3.23.15 or later.

</P>
<P>
Because of some critical bugs in the standard HP-UX libraries, you should
install the following patches before trying to run MySQL on HP-UX 11.0:

</P>

<PRE>
PHKL_22840 Streams cumulative
PHNE_22397 ARPA cumulative
</PRE>

<P>
This will solve the problem of getting <CODE>EWOULDBLOCK</CODE> from <CODE>recv()</CODE>
and <CODE>EBADF</CODE> from <CODE>accept()</CODE> in threaded applications.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.1 on an unpatched HP-UX 11.x system,
you will get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
In file included from /usr/include/unistd.h:11,
                 from ../include/global.h:125,

                 from item.cc:19:
</PRE>

<P>
The problem is that HP-UX doesn't define <CODE>pthreads_atfork()</CODE> consistently.
It has conflicting prototypes in
<TT>`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h'</TT>:184 and
<TT>`/usr/include/sys/pthread.h'</TT>:440 (details below).

</P>
<P>
One solution is to copy <TT>`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h'</TT> into
<TT>`mysql/include'</TT> and edit <TT>`unistd.h'</TT> and change it to match
the definition in <TT>`pthread.h'</TT>.  Here's the diff:

</P>

<PRE>
183,184c183,184
&#60;      extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(), void (*parent)(),
&#60;                                                void (*child)());

&#62;                                                void (*child)(void));
</PRE>

<P>
After this, the following configure line should work:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS="-fomit-frame-pointer -O3 -fpic" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -O3" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using MySQL 4.0.5 with the HP-UX compiler you can use:
(tested with cc B.11.11.04):

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc CXX=aCC CFLAGS=+DD64 CXXFLAGS=+DD64 ./configure --with-extra-character-set=complex
</PRE>

<P>
You can ignore any errors of the following type:

</P>

<PRE>
aCC: warning 901: unknown option: `-3': use +help for online documentation
</PRE>

<P>
If you get the following error from <CODE>configure</CODE>

</P>

<PRE>
checking for cc option to accept ANSI C... no
configure: error: MySQL requires a ANSI C compiler (and a C++ compiler).
Try gcc. See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.
</PRE>

<P>
Check that you don't have the path to the K&#38;R compiler before the path
to the HP-UX C and C++ compiler.

</P>
<P>
Another reason for not beeing able to compile is that you didn't define
the <CODE>+DD64</CODE> flags above.

</P>
<P>
Another possibility for HP-UX 11 is to use MySQL binaries for HP-UX 10.20.
We have received reports from some users that these binaries work fine on
HP-UX 11.00. If you encounter problems, be sure to check your HP-UX patch
level.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX351"></A>

</P>
<P>
Automatic detection of <CODE>xlC</CODE> is missing from Autoconf, so a
<CODE>configure</CODE> command something like this is needed when compiling
MySQL (This example uses the IBM compiler):

</P>

<PRE>
export CC="xlc_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192 "
export CXX="xlC_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192"
export CFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L /usr/local/lib"
export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS

./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                --localstatedir=/var/mysql \
                --sysconfdir=/etc/mysql \
                --sbindir='/usr/local/bin' \
                --libexecdir='/usr/local/bin' \
                --enable-thread-safe-client \
                --enable-large-files
</PRE>

<P>
Above are the options used to compile the MySQL distribution that
can be found at <a HREF="http://www-frec.bull.com/">http://www-frec.bull.com/</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you change the <CODE>-O3</CODE> to <CODE>-O2</CODE> in the above configure line,
you must also remove the <CODE>-qstrict</CODE> option (this is a limitation in
the IBM C compiler).

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>egcs</CODE> to compile MySQL, you
<STRONG>must</STRONG> use the <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> flag, as the exception
handling in <CODE>gcc</CODE>/<CODE>egcs</CODE> is not thread-safe!  (This is tested with
<CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.)  There are also some known problems with IBM's assembler,
which may cause it to generate bad code when used with gcc.

</P>
<P>
We recommend the following <CODE>configure</CODE> line with <CODE>egcs</CODE> and
<CODE>gcc 2.95</CODE> on AIX:

</P>

<PRE>
CC="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXX="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>-Wa,-many</CODE> is necessary for the compile to be successful.  IBM is
aware of this problem but is in to hurry to fix it because of the workaround
available.  We don't know if the <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> is required with
<CODE>gcc 2.95</CODE>, but as MySQL doesn't use exceptions and the above
option generates faster code, we recommend that you should always use this
option with <CODE>egcs / gcc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with assembler code try changing the -mcpu=xxx to
match your CPU. Typically power2, power, or powerpc may need to be used,
alternatively you might need to use 604 or 604e. I'm not positive but I
would think using "power" would likely be safe most of the time, even on
a power2 machine.

</P>
<P>
If you don't know what your CPU is then do a "uname -m", this will give
you back a string that looks like "000514676700", with a format of
xxyyyyyymmss where xx and ss are always 0's, yyyyyy is a unique system
ID and mm is the ID of the CPU Planar. A chart of these values can be
found at
<a HREF="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm</a>.
This will give you a machine type and a machine model you can use to
determine what type of CPU you have.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly
under high load) you may have found an OS bug with threads and
signals.  In this case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by
configuring with:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM CXX=gcc \
       CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti \
       -DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM" \
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug --with-low-memory
</PRE>

<P>
This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side
effect that you can't kill clients that are ``sleeping'' on a connection with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.  Instead, the client
will die when it issues its next command.

</P>
<P>
On some versions of AIX, linking with <CODE>libbind.a</CODE> makes
<CODE>getservbyname</CODE> core dump.  This is an AIX bug and should be reported
to IBM.

</P>
<P>
For AIX 4.2.1 and gcc you have to do the following changes.

</P>
<P>
After configuring, edit <TT>`config.h'</TT> and <TT>`include/my_config.h'</TT>
and change the line that says

</P>

<PRE>
#define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1
</PRE>

<P>
to

</P>

<PRE>
#undef HAVE_SNPRINTF
</PRE>

<P>
And finally, in <TT>`mysqld.cc'</TT> you need to add a prototype for initgoups.

</P>

<PRE>
#ifdef _AIX41
extern "C" int initgroups(const char *,int);
#endif
</PRE>

<P>
If you need to allocate a lot of memory to the mysqld process, it's not
enough to just set 'ulimit -d unlimited'. You may also have to set
in <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> something like:

</P>

<PRE>
export LDR_CNTRL='MAXDATA=0x80000000'
</PRE>

<P>
You can find more about using a lot of memory at:

On SunOS 4, MIT-pthreads is needed to compile MySQL, which in turn
means you will need GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Some SunOS 4 systems have problems with dynamic libraries and <CODE>libtool</CODE>.
You can use the following <CODE>configure</CODE> line to avoid this problem:

</P>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
When compiling <CODE>readline</CODE>, you may get warnings about duplicate defines.

If you are using egcs 1.1.2 on Digital Unix, you should upgrade to gcc
2.95.2, as egcs on DEC has some serious bugs!

</P>
<P>
When compiling threaded programs under Digital Unix, the documentation
recommends using the <CODE>-pthread</CODE> option for <CODE>cc</CODE> and <CODE>cxx</CODE> and
the libraries <CODE>-lmach -lexc</CODE> (in addition to <CODE>-lpthread</CODE>).  You
should run <CODE>configure</CODE> something like this:

mysqld.cc:626: passing long unsigned int *' as argument 3 of
accept(int,sockadddr *, int *)'
</PRE>

<P>
You can safely ignore these warnings.  They occur because <CODE>configure</CODE>
can detect only errors, not warnings.

</P>
<P>
If you start the server directly from the command-line, you may have problems
with it dying when you log out.  (When you log out, your outstanding processes
receive a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal.)  If so, try starting the server like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; nohup mysqld [options] &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>nohup</CODE> causes the command following it to ignore any <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
signal sent from the terminal.  Alternatively, start the server by running
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, which invokes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> using <CODE>nohup</CODE> for you.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

On OSF/1 V4.0D and compiler "DEC C V5.6-071 on Digital Unix V4.0 (Rev. 878)"
the compiler had some strange behaviour (undefined <CODE>asm</CODE> symbols).
<CODE>/bin/ld</CODE> also appears to be broken (problems with <CODE>_exit
undefined</CODE> errors occurring while linking <CODE>mysqld</CODE>).  On this system, we
have managed to compile MySQL with the following <CODE>configure</CODE>
line, after replacing <CODE>/bin/ld</CODE> with the version from OSF 4.0C:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

<P>
With the Digital compiler "C++ V6.1-029", the following should work:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc -pthread
CFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed -speculate all \
       -arch host
CXX=cxx -pthread
CXXFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed -speculate all \
          -arch host -noexceptions -nortti
export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
./configure --prefix=/usr/mysql/mysql --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static \
            --disable-shared --with-named-thread-libs="-lmach -lexc -lc"
</PRE>

<P>
In some versions of OSF/1, the <CODE>alloca()</CODE> function is broken. Fix
this by removing the line in <TT>`config.h'</TT> that defines <CODE>'HAVE_ALLOCA'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>alloca()</CODE> function also may have an incorrect prototype in
<CODE>/usr/include/alloca.h</CODE>.  This warning resulting from this can be ignored.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>configure</CODE> will use the following thread libraries automatically:
<CODE>--with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>gcc</CODE>, you can also try running <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-D_PTHREAD_USE_D4 CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure ...
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly
under high load), you may have found an OS bug with threads and
signals. In this case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by
configuring with:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
       CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
       ./configure ...
</PRE>

<P>
This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side
effect that you can't kill clients that are ``sleeping'' on a connection with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.  Instead, the client
will die when it issues its next command.

</P>
<P>
With <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2, you will probably run into the following compile error:

</P>

<PRE>
sql_acl.cc:1456: Internal compiler error in `scan_region', at except.c:2566
Please submit a full bug report.
</PRE>

<P>
To fix this you should change to the <CODE>sql</CODE> directory and do a ``cut
and paste'' of the last <CODE>gcc</CODE> line, but change <CODE>-O3</CODE> to
<CODE>-O0</CODE> (or add <CODE>-O0</CODE> immediately after <CODE>gcc</CODE> if you don't
have any <CODE>-O</CODE> option on your compile line).  After this is done you
can just change back to the top-level directly and run <CODE>make</CODE>
again.

</P>
<P>
In some Irix implementations, the <CODE>alloca()</CODE> function is broken.  If the

<LI>

For OpenServer 5.0.x you need to use gcc-2.95.2p1 or newer from the
Skunkware.  <a HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/">http://www.sco.com/skunkware/</a> and choose browser
OpenServer packages or by ftp to ftp2.caldera.com in the
pub/skunkware/osr5/devtools/gcc directory.

<LI>

You need the port of GCC 2.5.x for this product and the Development
system.  They are required on this version of SCO Unix.  You cannot
just use the GCC Dev system.

<LI>

You should get the FSU Pthreads package and install it first.  
This can be found at
<a HREF="http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/ftp/pub/PART/pthreads.tar.gz">http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/ftp/pub/PART/pthreads.tar.gz</a>.

<LI>

FSU Pthreads can be compiled with SCO Unix 4.2 with tcpip.  Or
OpenServer 3.0 or Open Desktop 3.0 (OS 3.0 ODT 3.0), with the SCO 
Development System installed using a good port of GCC 2.5.x ODT or OS
3.0 you will need a good port of GCC 2.5.x There are a lot of problems
without a good port.  The port for this product requires the SCO Unix
Development system.  Without it, you are missing the libraries and the
linker that is needed.

<LI>

To build FSU Pthreads on your system, do the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Run <CODE>./configure</CODE> in the <TT>`threads/src'</TT> directory and select
the SCO OpenServer option. This command copies <TT>`Makefile.SCO5'</TT> to
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>.

<LI>

Run <CODE>make</CODE>.

<LI>

To install in the default <TT>`/usr/include'</TT> directory, login as root,
then <CODE>cd</CODE> to the <TT>`thread/src'</TT> directory, and run <CODE>make
install</CODE>.
</OL>

<LI>

Remember to use GNU <CODE>make</CODE> when making MySQL.

<LI>

If you don't start <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE>, you probably will get only the
default 110 open files per process.  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will write a note about this
in the log file.

<LI>

With SCO 3.2V5.0.5, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
You should also use gcc 2.95.2 or newer!

The following <CODE>configure</CODE> command should work:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
</PRE>

<LI>

With SCO 3.2V4.2, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
The following <CODE>configure</CODE> command should work:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" \

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL should automatically detect FSU Pthreads and link <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
with <CODE>-lgthreads -lsocket -lgthreads</CODE>.

<LI>

The SCO development libraries are re-entrant in FSU Pthreads.
SCO claim's that its libraries' functions are re-entrant, so they must
be reentrant with FSU Pthreads.  FSU Pthreads on OpenServer tries to use
the SCO scheme to make re-entrant libraries.

<LI>

FSU Pthreads (at least the version at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>) comes
linked with GNU <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  If you encounter problems with memory usage,
make sure that <TT>`gmalloc.o'</TT> is included in <TT>`libgthreads.a'</TT> and
<TT>`libgthreads.so'</TT>.

<LI>

In FSU Pthreads, the following system calls are pthreads-aware: <CODE>read()</CODE>,
<CODE>write()</CODE>, <CODE>getmsg()</CODE>, <CODE>connect()</CODE>, <CODE>accept()</CODE>,
<CODE>select()</CODE>, and <CODE>wait()</CODE>.

<LI>

The CSSA-2001-SCO.35.2 (the patch is listed in custom as
erg711905-dscr_remap security patch (version 2.0.0) breaks FSU threads and
makes mysqld unstable.  You have to remove this one if you want to run

Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the

<CODE>DBD</CODE>/<CODE>DBI</CODE> client code requires Perl Version 5.004 or later.  The
interface <STRONG>will not work</STRONG> if you have an older version of Perl.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Perl support also requires that you've installed
MySQL client programming support.  If you installed MySQL
from RPM files, client programs are in the client RPM, but client programming
support is in the developer RPM.  Make sure you've installed the latter RPM.

</P>
<P>
As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is distributed separately from the main
MySQL distribution.  If you want to install Perl support, the files
you will need can be obtained from
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-dbi.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-dbi.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
The Perl distributions are provided as compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> archives and
have names like <TT>`MODULE-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT>, where <CODE>MODULE</CODE> is the
module name and <CODE>VERSION</CODE> is the version number.  You should get the
<CODE>Data-Dumper</CODE>, <CODE>DBI</CODE>, and <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> distributions
and install them in that order.  The installation procedure is shown here.
The example shown is for the <CODE>Data-Dumper</CODE> module, but the procedure is
the same for all three distributions:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; Data-Dumper-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

This command creates a directory named <TT>`Data-Dumper-VERSION'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd Data-Dumper-VERSION

shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make test
shell&#62; make install
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
The <CODE>make test</CODE> command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
<CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> installation to exercise the interface code, the
MySQL server must be running or the test will fail.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL,
particularly if you notice symptoms such as all your <CODE>DBI</CODE> scripts

<H3><A NAME="Perl_support_problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#Perl_support_problems">2.7.3  Problems Using the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> Interface</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX359"></A>
<A NAME="IDX360"></A>

</P>
<P>
If Perl reports that it can't find the <TT>`../mysql/mysql.so'</TT> module,
then the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
<TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
You can fix this by any of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Compile the <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> distribution with <CODE>perl
Makefile.PL -static -config</CODE> rather than <CODE>perl Makefile.PL</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> to the directory where your other shared
libraries are located (probably <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT> or <TT>`/lib'</TT>).

<LI>

On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
<TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located to the <TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT> file.

<A NAME="IDX361"></A>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable.
</UL>

<P>
If you get the following errors from <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>,
you are probably using <CODE>gcc</CODE> (or using an old binary compiled with
<CODE>gcc</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'
</PRE>

<P>
Add <CODE>-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc</CODE> to the link command when the
<TT>`mysql.so'</TT> library gets built (check the output from <CODE>make</CODE> for
<TT>`mysql.so'</TT> when you compile the Perl client).  The <CODE>-L</CODE> option
should specify the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> is located
on your system.

</P>
<P>
Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error from <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>
when you run the tests:

</P>

<PRE>
t/00base............install_driver(mysql) failed:
Can't load '../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so' for module DBD::mysql:
../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so: undefined symbol:
uncompress at /usr/lib/perl5/5.00503/i586-linux/DynaLoader.pm line 169.
</PRE>

<P>
it means that you need to include the compression library, -lz, to the
link line. This can be doing the following change in the file
<TT>`lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
$sysliblist .= " -lm";

to

$sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";
</PRE>

<P>
After this, you <STRONG>must</STRONG> run 'make realclean' and then proceed with the
installation from the beginning.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support
dynamic linking (like SCO) you can generate a static version of
Perl that includes <CODE>DBI</CODE> and <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>.  The way this works
is that you generate a version of Perl with the <CODE>DBI</CODE> code linked
in and install it on top of your current Perl.  Then you use that to
build a version of Perl that additionally has the <CODE>DBD</CODE> code linked
in, and install that.

</P>
<P>
On SCO, you must have the following environment variables set:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
or
shell&#62; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell&#62; LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell&#62; MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:\
/usr/skunk/man:
</PRE>

<P>
First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked <CODE>DBI</CODE> by running
these commands in the directory where your <CODE>DBI</CODE> distribution is
located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; make perl
</PRE>

<P>
Then you must install the new Perl. The output of <CODE>make perl</CODE> will
indicate the exact <CODE>make</CODE> command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On SCO, this is
<CODE>make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also includes a
statically-linked <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> by running these commands in the
directory where your <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE> distribution is located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; make perl
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of <CODE>make
perl</CODE> indicates the command to use.

This chapter provides a tutorial introduction to MySQL by showing
how to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client program to create and use a simple
database.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> (sometimes referred to as the ``terminal monitor'' or
just ``monitor'') is an interactive program that allows you to connect to a
MySQL server, run queries, and view the results.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> may
also be used in batch mode: you place your queries in a file beforehand, then
tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to execute the contents of the file.  Both ways of using
<CODE>mysql</CODE> are covered here.

</P>
<P>
To see a list of options provided by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, invoke it with
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --help
</PRE>

<P>
This chapter assumes that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is installed on your machine and that
a MySQL server is available to which you can connect.  If this is
not true, contact your MySQL administrator.  (If <STRONG>you</STRONG> are the
administrator, you will need to consult other sections of this manual.)

</P>
<P>
This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a
database.  If you are interested only in accessing an already-existing
database, you may want to skip over the sections that describe how to
create the database and the tables it contains.

</P>
<P>
Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, many details are necessarily
omitted.  Consult the relevant sections of the manual for more
information on the topics covered here.

To connect to the server, you'll usually need to provide a MySQL
user name when you invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE> and, most likely, a password.  If the
server runs on a machine other than the one where you log in, you'll also
need to specify a hostname.  Contact your administrator to find out what
connection parameters you should use to connect (that is, what host, user name,
and password to use).  Once you know the proper parameters, you should be
able to connect like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>********</CODE> represents your password; enter it when <CODE>mysql</CODE>
displays the <CODE>Enter password:</CODE> prompt.

</P>
<P>
If that works, you should see some introductory information followed by a
<CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 25338 to server version: 4.0.14-log

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The prompt tells you that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is ready for you to enter commands.

</P>
<P>
Some MySQL installations allow users to connect as the anonymous
(unnamed) user to the server running on the local host.  If this is the case
on your machine, you should be able to connect to that server by invoking
<CODE>mysql</CODE> without any options:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql
</PRE>

<P>
After you have connected successfully, you can disconnect any time by typing
<CODE>QUIT</CODE> (or <CODE>\q</CODE>) at the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; QUIT
Bye
</PRE>

<P>
On Unix, you can also disconnect by pressing Control-D.

</P>
<P>
Most examples in the following sections assume you are connected to the
server.  They indicate this by the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Entering_queries" HREF="manual_toc.html#Entering_queries">3.2  Entering Queries</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX371"></A>
<A NAME="IDX372"></A>
<A NAME="IDX373"></A>

</P>
<P>
Make sure you are connected to the server, as discussed in the previous
section.  Doing so will not in itself select any database to work with, but
that's okay.  At this point, it's more important to find out a little about
how to issue queries than to jump right in creating tables, loading data
into them, and retrieving data from them.  This section describes the basic
principles of entering commands, using several queries you can try out to
familiarise yourself with how <CODE>mysql</CODE> works.

</P>
<P>
Here's a simple command that asks the server to tell you its version number
and the current date.  Type it in as shown here following the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>
prompt and press Enter:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------+--------------+
| VERSION()    | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log | 1999-03-19   |
+--------------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
This query illustrates several things about <CODE>mysql</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A command normally consists of an SQL statement followed by a semicolon.
(There are some exceptions where a semicolon may be omitted.  <CODE>QUIT</CODE>,
mentioned earlier, is one of them.  We'll get to others later.)

<LI>

When you issue a command, <CODE>mysql</CODE> sends it to the server for execution
and displays the results, then prints another <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt to indicate
that it is ready for another command.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> displays query output in tabular form (rows and columns).  The
first row contains labels for the columns.  The rows following are the query
results.  Normally, column labels are the names of the columns you fetch from
database tables.  If you're retrieving the value of an expression rather than
a table column (as in the example just shown), <CODE>mysql</CODE> labels the column
using the expression itself.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> shows how many rows were returned and how long the query took
to execute, which gives you a rough idea of server performance.  These values
are imprecise because they represent wall clock time (not CPU or machine
time), and because they are affected by factors such as server load and
network latency.  (For brevity, the ``rows in set'' line is not shown in
the remaining examples in this chapter.)
</UL>

<P>
Keywords may be entered in any lettercase.  The following queries are
equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
mysql&#62; select version(), current_date;
mysql&#62; SeLeCt vErSiOn(), current_DATE;
</PRE>

<P>
Here's another query.  It demonstrates that you can use <CODE>mysql</CODE> as a
simple calculator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SIN(PI()/4), (4+1)*5;
+-------------+---------+
| SIN(PI()/4) | (4+1)*5 |
+-------------+---------+
|    0.707107 |      25 |
+-------------+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
The queries shown thus far have been relatively short, single-line
statements.  You can even enter multiple statements on a single line.
Just end each one with a semicolon:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(); SELECT NOW();
+--------------+
| VERSION()    |
+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log |
+--------------+

+---------------------+
| NOW()               |
+---------------------+
| 1999-03-19 00:15:33 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
A command need not be given all on a single line, so lengthy commands that
require several lines are not a problem.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> determines where your
statement ends by looking for the terminating semicolon, not by looking for
the end of the input line.  (In other words, <CODE>mysql</CODE>
accepts free-format input:  it collects input lines but does not execute them
until it sees the semicolon.)

</P>
<P>
Here's a simple multiple-line statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT
    -&#62; USER()
    -&#62; ,
    -&#62; CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------------+--------------+
| USER()             | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------------+--------------+
| joesmith@localhost | 1999-03-18   |
+--------------------+--------------+
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, notice how the prompt changes from <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> to
<CODE>-&#62;</CODE> after you enter the first line of a multiple-line query.  This is
how <CODE>mysql</CODE> indicates that it hasn't seen a complete statement and is
waiting for the rest.  The prompt is your friend, because it provides
valuable feedback.  If you use that feedback, you will always be aware of
what <CODE>mysql</CODE> is waiting for.

</P>
<P>
If you decide you don't want to execute a command that you are in the
process of entering, cancel it by typing <CODE>\c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT
    -&#62; USER()
    -&#62; \c
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Here, too, notice the prompt.  It switches back to <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> after you
type <CODE>\c</CODE>, providing feedback to indicate that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is ready
for a new command.

</P>
<P>
The following table shows each of the prompts you may see and summarises what
they mean about the state that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is in:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX374"></A>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Prompt</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Ready for new command.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    -&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line of multiple-line command.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    '&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins with a single quote (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    "&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins with a double quote (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    `&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line, collecting an identifier that begins with a backtick (<SAMP>``'</SAMP>).
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
Multiple-line statements commonly occur by accident when you intend to
issue a command on a single line, but forget the terminating semicolon.  In
this case, <CODE>mysql</CODE> waits for more input:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER()
    -&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
If this happens to you (you think you've entered a statement but the only
response is a <CODE>-&#62;</CODE> prompt), most likely <CODE>mysql</CODE> is waiting for the
semicolon.  If you don't notice what the prompt is telling you, you might sit
there for a while before realising what you need to do.  Enter a semicolon to
complete the statement, and <CODE>mysql</CODE> will execute it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER()
    -&#62; ;
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| joesmith@localhost |
+--------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts occur during string collection.
In MySQL, you can write strings surrounded by either <SAMP>`''</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> characters (for example, <CODE>'hello'</CODE> or <CODE>"goodbye"</CODE>),
and <CODE>mysql</CODE> lets you enter strings that span multiple lines.  When you
see a <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> or <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompt, it means that you've entered a line
containing a string that begins with a <SAMP>`''</SAMP> or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> quote character,
but have not yet entered the matching quote that terminates the string.
That's fine if you really are entering a multiple-line string, but how likely
is that?  Not very.  More often, the <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts indicate
that you've inadvertantly left out a quote character.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age &#60; 30;
    "&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
If you enter this <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, then press Enter and wait for the
result, nothing will happen.  Instead of wondering why this
query takes so long, notice the clue provided by the <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompt.  It
tells you that <CODE>mysql</CODE> expects to see the rest of an unterminated
string.  (Do you see the error in the statement?  The string <CODE>"Smith</CODE> is
missing the second quote.)

</P>
<P>
At this point, what do you do?  The simplest thing is to cancel the command.
However, you cannot just type <CODE>\c</CODE> in this case, because <CODE>mysql</CODE>
interprets it as part of the string that it is collecting!  Instead, enter
the closing quote character (so <CODE>mysql</CODE> knows you've finished the
string), then type <CODE>\c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age &#60; 30;
    "&#62; "\c
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The prompt changes back to <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>, indicating that <CODE>mysql</CODE>
is ready for a new command.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>`&#62;</CODE> prompt is similar to th <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts,
but indicates that you have begun but not completed a backtick-quoted
identifier.

</P>
<P>
It's important to know what the <CODE>'&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>"&#62;</CODE>, and <CODE>`&#62;</CODE> prompts signify,
because if you mistakenly enter an unterminated string, any further lines you
type will appear to be ignored by <CODE>mysql</CODE>---including a line
containing <CODE>QUIT</CODE>!  This can be quite confusing, especially if you
don't know that you need to supply the terminating quote before you can
cancel the current command.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX377"></A>

</P>

<P>
Now that you know how to enter commands, it's time to access a database.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have several pets in your home (your menagerie) and you'd
like to keep track of various types of information about them.  You can do so
by creating tables to hold your data and loading them with the desired
information.  Then you can answer different sorts of questions about your
animals by retrieving data from the tables.  This section shows you how to:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Create a database
<LI>

Create a table
<LI>

Load data into the table
<LI>

Retrieve data from the table in various ways
<LI>

Use multiple tables
</UL>

<P>
The menagerie database will be simple (deliberately), but it is not difficult
to think of real-world situations in which a similar type of database might
be used.  For example, a database like this could be used by a farmer to keep
track of livestock, or by a veterinarian to keep track of patient records.
A menagerie distribution containing some of the queries and sample data used
in the following sections can be obtained from the MySQL web site.
It's available in either compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> format
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz</a>)
or Zip format
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip</a>).

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>SHOW</CODE> statement to find out what databases currently exist
on the server:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW DATABASES;
+----------+
| Database |
+----------+
| mysql    |
| test     |
| tmp      |
+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
The list of databases is probably different on your machine, but the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> and <CODE>test</CODE> databases are likely to be among them.  The
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database is required because it describes user access
privileges.  The <CODE>test</CODE> database is often provided as a workspace for
users to try things out.

</P>
<P>
Note that you may not see all databases if you don't have the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>test</CODE> database exists, try to access it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE test
Database changed
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>USE</CODE>, like <CODE>QUIT</CODE>, does not require a semicolon.  (You
can terminate such statements with a semicolon if you like; it does no harm.)
The <CODE>USE</CODE> statement is special in another way, too:  it must be given on
a single line.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>test</CODE> database (if you have access to it) for the
examples that follow, but anything you create in that database can be
removed by anyone else with access to it.  For this reason, you should
probably ask your MySQL administrator for permission to use a
database of your own.  Suppose you want to call yours <CODE>menagerie</CODE>.  The
administrator needs to execute a command like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL ON menagerie.* TO 'your_mysql_name'@'your_client_host';
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>your_mysql_name</CODE> is the MySQL user name assigned to
you and <CODE>your_client_host</CODE> is the host from which you connect to the
server.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Creating_database" HREF="manual_toc.html#Creating_database">3.3.1  Creating and Selecting a Database</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX378"></A>
<A NAME="IDX379"></A>

</P>
<P>
If the administrator creates your database for you when setting up your
permissions, you can begin using it.  Otherwise, you need to create it
yourself:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
</PRE>

<P>
Under Unix, database names are case-sensitive (unlike SQL keywords), so you
must always refer to your database as <CODE>menagerie</CODE>, not as
<CODE>Menagerie</CODE>, <CODE>MENAGERIE</CODE>, or some other variant.  This is also true
for table names.  (Under Windows, this restriction does not apply, although
you must refer to databases and tables using the same lettercase throughout a
given query.)

</P>
<P>
Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that explicitly.
To make <CODE>menagerie</CODE> the current database, use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE menagerie
Database changed
</PRE>

<P>
Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select it for use
each time you begin a <CODE>mysql</CODE> session.  You can do this by issuing a
<CODE>USE</CODE> statement as shown in the example.  Alternatively, you can select the
database on the command-line when you invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE>.  Just specify its
name after any connection parameters that you might need to provide.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p menagerie
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>menagerie</CODE> is not your password on the command just shown.
If you want to supply your password on the command-line after the <CODE>-p</CODE>
option, you must do so with no intervening space (for example, as
<CODE>-pmypassword</CODE>, not as <CODE>-p mypassword</CODE>).  However, putting your
password on the command-line is not recommended, because doing so exposes it
to snooping by other users logged in on your machine.

<P>
The harder part is deciding what the structure of your database should be:
what tables you will need and what columns will be in each of them.

You'll want a table that contains a record for each of your pets.  This can
be called the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, and it should contain, as a bare minimum,
each animal's name.  Because the name by itself is not very interesting, the
table should contain other information.  For example, if more than one person
in your family keeps pets, you might want to list each animal's owner.  You
might also want to record some basic descriptive information such as species
and sex.

</P>
<P>
How about age?  That might be of interest, but it's not a good thing to store
in a database.  Age changes as time passes, which means you'd have to update
your records often.  Instead, it's better to store a fixed value such as
date of birth.  Then, whenever you need age, you can calculate it as the
difference between the current date and the birth date.  MySQL
provides functions for doing date arithmetic, so this is not difficult.
Storing birth date rather than age has other advantages, too:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can use the database for tasks such as generating reminders for upcoming
pet birthdays.  (If you think this type of query is somewhat silly, note that
it is the same question you might ask in the context of a business database
to identify clients to whom you'll soon need to send out birthday greetings,
for that computer-assisted personal touch.)

<LI>

You can calculate age in relation to dates other than the current date.  For
example, if you store death date in the database, you can easily calculate
how old a pet was when it died.
</UL>

<P>
You can probably think of other types of information that would be useful in
the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, but the ones identified so far are sufficient for now:
name, owner, species, sex, birth, and death.

</P>
<P>
Use a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement to specify the layout of your table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
    -&#62; species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> is a good choice for the <CODE>name</CODE>, <CODE>owner</CODE>, and
<CODE>species</CODE> columns because the column values will vary in length.  The
lengths of those columns need not all be the same, and need not be
<CODE>20</CODE>.  You can pick any length from <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>, whatever
seems most reasonable to you.  (If you make a poor choice and it turns
out later that you need a longer field, MySQL provides an
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.)

</P>
<P>
Several types of values can be chosen to represent sex in animal records,
such as <CODE>"m"</CODE>
and <CODE>"f"</CODE>, or perhaps <CODE>"male"</CODE> and <CODE>"female"</CODE>.  It's simplest
to use the single characters <CODE>"m"</CODE> and <CODE>"f"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The use of the <CODE>DATE</CODE> datatype for the <CODE>birth</CODE> and <CODE>death</CODE>
columns is a fairly obvious choice.

</P>
<P>
Now that you have created a table, <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> should produce some
output:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
To verify that your table was created the way you expected, use
a <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can use <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> any time, for example, if you forget the names of
the columns in your table or what types they have.

<P>
Because you are beginning with an empty table, an easy way to populate it is to
create a text file containing a row for each of your animals, then load the
contents of the file into the table with a single statement.

</P>
<P>
You could create a text file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> containing one record per line,
with values separated by tabs, and given in the order in which the columns
were listed in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  For missing values (such
as unknown sexes or death dates for animals that are still living), you can
use <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.  To represent these in your text file, use
<CODE>\N</CODE> (backslash, capital-N).  For example, the record for Whistler the
bird would look like
this (where the whitespace between values is a single tab character):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>owner</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>species</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>sex</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>birth</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>death</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
To load the text file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> into the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, use this
command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;
</PRE>

<P>
You can specify the column value separator and end of line marker explicitly
in the <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement if you wish, but the defaults are tab and
linefeed.  These are sufficient for the statement to read the file
<TT>`pet.txt'</TT> properly.

</P>
<P>
If the statement fails, it is likely that your MySQL installation does not
have local file capability enabled by default.  See
section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA_LOCAL">4.2.4  Security issues with <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE></A> for information on how to
change this.

</P>
<P>
When you want to add new records one at a time, the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
is useful.  In its simplest form, you supply values for each column, in the
order in which the columns were listed in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.
Suppose Diane gets a new hamster named Puffball.  You could add a new record
using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO pet
    -&#62; VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that string and date values are specified as quoted strings here.  Also,
with <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, you can insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> directly to represent a
missing value.  You do not use <CODE>\N</CODE> like you do with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
From this example, you should be able to see that there would be a lot more
typing involved to load
your records initially using several <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements rather
than a single <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement.

The general form of the statement is:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT what_to_select

</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>what_to_select</CODE> indicates what you want to see.  This can be a list of

indicates the table from which you want to retrieve data.  The <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause is optional.  If it's present, <CODE>conditions_to_satisfy</CODE> specifies
conditions that rows must satisfy to qualify for retrieval.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Selecting_all" HREF="manual_toc.html#Selecting_all">3.3.4.1  Selecting All Data</A></H4>

<P>
The simplest form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves everything from a table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet;
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
| Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |

+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
This form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is useful if you want to review your entire table,
for instance, after you've just loaded it with your initial dataset.  For
example, you may happen to think that the birth date for Bowser doesn't seem
quite right.  Consulting your original pedigree
papers, you find that the correct birth year should be 1989, not 1979.

</P>
<P>
There are least a couple of ways to fix this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Edit the file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> to correct the error, then empty the table
and reload it using <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM pet;
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;
</PRE>

However, if you do this, you must also re-enter the record for Puffball.

<LI>

Fix only the erroneous record with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE pet SET birth = "1989-08-31" WHERE name = "Bowser";
</PRE>

The <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> changes only the record in question and does not require you
to reload the table.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Selecting_rows" HREF="manual_toc.html#Selecting_rows">3.3.4.2  Selecting Particular Rows</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX389"></A>
<A NAME="IDX390"></A>

</P>
<P>
As shown in the preceding section, it is easy to retrieve an entire table.
Just omit the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause from the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.
But typically you don't want
to see the entire table, particularly when it becomes large.  Instead,
you're usually more interested in answering a particular question, in which
case you specify some constraints on the information you want.  Let's look at
some selection queries in terms of questions about your pets that they
answer.

</P>
<P>
You can select only particular rows from your table.  For example, if you want
to verify the change that you made to Bowser's birth date, select Bowser's
record like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = "Bowser";
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Bowser | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The output confirms that the year is correctly recorded now as 1989, not 1979.

</P>
<P>
String comparisons normally are case-insensitive, so you can specify the
name as <CODE>"bowser"</CODE>, <CODE>"BOWSER"</CODE>, etc.  The query result will be
the same.

</P>
<P>
You can specify conditions on any column, not just <CODE>name</CODE>.  For example,
if you want to know which animals were born after 1998, test the <CODE>birth</CODE>
column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth &#62;= "1998-1-1";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Puffball | Diane | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can combine conditions, for example, to locate female dogs:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "dog" AND sex = "f";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The preceding query uses the <CODE>AND</CODE> logical operator.  There is also an
<CODE>OR</CODE> operator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "snake" OR species = "bird";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL  |
| Slim     | Benny | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>AND</CODE> and <CODE>OR</CODE> may be intermixed, though <CODE>AND</CODE> has higher
precedence than <CODE>OR</CODE>.  If you use both operators, it's a good idea
to use parentheses to indicate explicitly how conditions should be grouped:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE (species = "cat" AND sex = "m")
    -&#62; OR (species = "dog" AND sex = "f");
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

If you don't want to see entire rows from your table, just name the columns
in which you're interested, separated by commas.  For example, if you want to
know when your animals were born, select the <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>birth</CODE>
columns:

+----------+------------+

| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
+----------+------------+

<P>
To find out who owns pets, use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner FROM pet;
+--------+
| owner  |

| Harold |

| Harold |
| Benny  |

| Gwen   |
| Gwen   |
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
+--------+
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX393"></A>
However, notice that the query simply retrieves the <CODE>owner</CODE> field from
each record, and some of them appear more than once.  To minimise the output,
retrieve each unique output record just once by adding the keyword
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM pet;
+--------+
| owner  |
+--------+
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
| Gwen   |
| Harold |
+--------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can use a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to combine row selection with column
selection.  For example, to get birth dates for dogs and cats only,
use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE species = "dog" OR species = "cat";
+--------+---------+------------+

You may have noticed in the preceding examples that the result rows are
displayed in no particular order.  It's often easier to examine
query output when the rows are sorted in some meaningful way.  To sort a
result, use an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
Here are animal birthdays, sorted by date:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth;

| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
+----------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
On character type columns, sorting--like all other comparison
operations--is normally performed in a case-insensitive fashion.
This means that the order will be undefined for columns that are identical
except for their case. You can force a case-sensitive sort for a column
by using the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast: <CODE>ORDER BY BINARY col_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The default sort order is ascending, with smallest values first.
To sort in reverse (descending) order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> keyword to the
name of the column you are sorting by:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth DESC;
+----------+------------+
| name     | birth      |
+----------+------------+
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |

| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
| Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
+----------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can sort on multiple columns, and you can sort columns in different
directions.  For example, to sort by type of
animal in ascending order, then by birth date within animal type in descending
order (youngest animals first), use the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet ORDER BY species, birth DESC;
+----------+---------+------------+
| name     | species | birth      |
+----------+---------+------------+

| Whistler | bird    | 1997-12-09 |
| Claws    | cat     | 1994-03-17 |
| Fluffy   | cat     | 1993-02-04 |
| Fang     | dog     | 1990-08-27 |
| Bowser   | dog     | 1989-08-31 |
| Buffy    | dog     | 1989-05-13 |

| Slim     | snake   | 1996-04-29 |
+----------+---------+------------+

Note that the <CODE>DESC</CODE> keyword applies only to the column name immediately
preceding it (<CODE>birth</CODE>); it does not affect the <CODE>species</CODE> column sort
order.

To determine how many years old each of your pets is, compute the

<P>
Here, <CODE>YEAR()</CODE> pulls out the year part of a date and <CODE>RIGHT()</CODE>
pulls off the rightmost five characters that represent the <CODE>MM-DD</CODE>
(calendar year) part of the date.  The part of the expression that
compares the <CODE>MM-DD</CODE> values evaluates to 1 or 0, which adjusts the
year difference down a year if <CODE>CURDATE()</CODE> occurs earlier in
the year than <CODE>birth</CODE>.  The full expression is somewhat ungainly,
so an alias (<CODE>age</CODE>) is used to make the output column label more
meaningful.

</P>
<P>
The query works, but the result could be scanned more easily if the rows
were presented in some order.  This can be done by adding an <CODE>ORDER
BY name</CODE> clause to sort the output by name:

mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURDATE(),

<P>
A similar query can be used to determine age at death for animals that have
died.  You determine which animals these are by checking whether the
<CODE>death</CODE> value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  Then, for those with non-<CODE>NULL</CODE>
values, compute the difference between the <CODE>death</CODE> and <CODE>birth</CODE>
values:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, death,
    -&#62; (YEAR(death)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(death,5)&#60;RIGHT(birth,5))
    -&#62; AS age
    -&#62; FROM pet WHERE death IS NOT NULL ORDER BY age;
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| name   | birth      | death      | age  |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| Bowser | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |    5 |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The query uses <CODE>death IS NOT NULL</CODE> rather than <CODE>death &#60;&#62; NULL</CODE>
because <CODE>NULL</CODE> is a special value that cannot be compared using the usual
comparison operators.  This is discussed later.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Working_with_NULL">3.3.4.6  Working with <CODE>NULL</CODE> Values</A>.

</P>
<P>
What if you want to know which animals have birthdays next month?  For this
type of calculation, year and day are irrelevant; you simply want to extract
the month part of the <CODE>birth</CODE> column.  MySQL provides several
date-part extraction functions, such as <CODE>YEAR()</CODE>, <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>, and
<CODE>DAYOFMONTH()</CODE>.  <CODE>MONTH()</CODE> is the appropriate function here.  To
see how it works, run a simple query that displays the value of both
<CODE>birth</CODE> and <CODE>MONTH(birth)</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, MONTH(birth) FROM pet;
+----------+------------+--------------+
| name     | birth      | MONTH(birth) |
+----------+------------+--------------+

| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |            3 |
+----------+------------+--------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Finding animals with birthdays in the upcoming month is easy, too.  Suppose
the current month is April.  Then the month value is <CODE>4</CODE> and you look
for animals born in May (month <CODE>5</CODE>) like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = 5;
+-------+------------+
| name  | birth      |
+-------+------------+
| Buffy | 1989-05-13 |
+-------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
There is a small complication if the current month is December, of course.
You don't just add one to the month number (<CODE>12</CODE>) and look for animals
born in month <CODE>13</CODE>, because there is no such month.  Instead, you look for
animals born in January (month <CODE>1</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
You can even write the query so that it works no matter what the current
month is.  That way you don't have to use a particular month number
in the query.  <CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> allows you to add a time interval to a
given date.  If you add a month to the value of <CODE>CURDATE()</CODE>, then extract
the month part with <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>, the result produces the month in which to
look for birthdays:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE MONTH(birth) = MONTH(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH));
</PRE>

<P>
A different way to accomplish the same task is to add <CODE>1</CODE> to get the
next month after the current one (after using the modulo function (<CODE>MOD</CODE>)
to wrap around the month value to <CODE>0</CODE> if it is currently
<CODE>12</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(CURDATE()), 12) + 1;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>MONTH</CODE> returns a number between <CODE>1</CODE> and <CODE>12</CODE>. And
<CODE>MOD(something,12)</CODE> returns a number between <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>11</CODE>. So the
addition has to be after the <CODE>MOD()</CODE>, otherwise we would go from
November (<CODE>11</CODE>) to January (<CODE>1</CODE>).

</P>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NULL</CODE> value can be surprising until you get used to it.
Conceptually, <CODE>NULL</CODE> means missing value or unknown value and it
is treated somewhat differently than other values.  To test for <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
you cannot use the arithmetic comparison operators such as <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>,
or <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>.  To demonstrate this for yourself, try the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 = NULL, 1 &#60;&#62; NULL, 1 &#60; NULL, 1 &#62; NULL;
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
| 1 = NULL | 1 &#60;&#62; NULL | 1 &#60; NULL | 1 &#62; NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
|     NULL |      NULL |     NULL |     NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Clearly you get no meaningful results from these comparisons.  Use
the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and <CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> operators instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;
+-----------+---------------+
| 1 IS NULL | 1 IS NOT NULL |
+-----------+---------------+
|         0 |             1 |
+-----------+---------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in MySQL, <CODE>0</CODE> or <CODE>NULL</CODE> means false and anything else means
true. The default truth value from a boolean operation is <CODE>1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This special treatment of <CODE>NULL</CODE> is why, in the previous section, it
was necessary to determine which animals are no longer alive using
<CODE>death IS NOT NULL</CODE> instead of <CODE>death &#60;&#62; NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Two <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are regarded as equal in a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When doing an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented first if you
do <CODE>ORDER BY ... ASC</CODE> and last if you do <CODE>ORDER BY ... DESC</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL 4.0.2 to 4.0.10 incorrectly always sorts <CODE>NULL</CODE> values
first regardless of the sort direction.

MySQL provides standard SQL pattern matching as well as a form of
pattern matching based on extended regular expressions similar to those used
by Unix utilities such as <CODE>vi</CODE>, <CODE>grep</CODE>, and <CODE>sed</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
SQL pattern matching allows you to use <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> to match any single
character and <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to match an arbitrary number of characters (including
zero characters).  In MySQL, SQL patterns are case-insensitive by
default.  Some examples are shown here.  Note that you do not use <CODE>=</CODE>
or <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE> when you use SQL patterns; use the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> or <CODE>NOT
LIKE</CODE> comparison operators instead.

+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+

<P>
To find names containing exactly five characters, use fives instances of
the <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> pattern character:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE "_____";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |

| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The other type of pattern matching provided by MySQL uses extended
regular expressions.  When you test for a match for this type of pattern, use
the <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> and <CODE>NOT REGEXP</CODE> operators (or <CODE>RLIKE</CODE> and
<CODE>NOT RLIKE</CODE>, which are synonyms).

</P>
<P>
Some characteristics of extended regular expressions are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> matches any single character.

<LI>

A character class <SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP> matches any character within the brackets.
For example, <SAMP>`[abc]'</SAMP> matches <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  To name a
range of characters, use a dash.  <SAMP>`[a-z]'</SAMP> matches any letter,
whereas <SAMP>`[0-9]'</SAMP> matches any digit.

<LI>

<SAMP>`*'</SAMP> matches zero or more instances of the thing preceding it.  For
example, <SAMP>`x*'</SAMP> matches any number of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> characters,
<SAMP>`[0-9]*'</SAMP> matches any number of digits, and <SAMP>`.*'</SAMP> matches any
number of anything.

<LI>

A <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> pattern match succeed if
the pattern matches anywhere in the value being tested.
(This differs from a <CODE>LIKE</CODE> pattern match, which succeeds only if the
pattern matches the entire value.)

<LI>

To anchor a pattern so that it must match the beginning or end of the value
being tested, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> at the beginning or <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> at the end of the
pattern.
</UL>

<P>
To demonstrate how extended regular expressions work, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> queries
shown previously are rewritten here to use <CODE>REGEXP</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To find names beginning with <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> to match the beginning of
the name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^b";
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Bowser | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Prior to MySQL Version 3.23.4, <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is case-sensitive,
and the previous query will return no rows. In this case, to match either
lowercase or uppercase <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, use this query instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^[bB]";
</PRE>

<P>
From MySQL 3.23.4 on, if you really want to force a <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> comparison to
be case-sensitive, use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> keyword to make one of the
strings a binary string. This query will match only lowercase <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>
at the beginning of a name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP BINARY "^b";
</PRE>

<P>
To find names ending with <SAMP>`fy'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to match the end of the
name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "fy$";
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Fluffy | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL  |
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
To find names containing a <SAMP>`w'</SAMP>, use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "w";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Claws    | Gwen  | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Because a regular expression pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the
value, it is not necessary in the previous query to put a wildcard on either
side of the pattern to get it to match the entire value like it would be if
you used an SQL pattern.

</P>
<P>
To find names containing exactly five characters, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>
to match the beginning and end of the name, and five instances of <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>
in between:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^.....$";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You could also write the previous query using the <SAMP>`{n}'</SAMP>
``repeat-<CODE>n</CODE>-times'' operator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^.{5}$";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

Databases are often used to answer the question, ``How often does a certain
type of data occur in a table?''  For example, you might want to know how
many pets you have, or how many pets each owner has, or you might want to
perform various kinds of census operations on your animals.

</P>
<P>
Counting the total number of animals you have is the same question as ``How
many rows are in the <CODE>pet</CODE> table?'' because there is one record per pet.
<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> counts the number of rows, so
the query to count your animals looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        9 |
+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Earlier, you retrieved the names of the people who owned pets.  You can
use <CODE>COUNT()</CODE> if you want to find out how many pets each owner has:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
+--------+----------+
| owner  | COUNT(*) |
+--------+----------+

| Gwen   |        3 |
| Harold |        2 |
+--------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> to group together all records for each
<CODE>owner</CODE>.  Without it, all you get is an error message:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet;
ERROR 1140: Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)

</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>COUNT()</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> are useful for characterising your

<P>
You need not retrieve an entire table when you use <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>.  For

this:

</P>

| dog     | m    |        2 |
+---------+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you wanted the number of animals per sex only for known-sex animals:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet

<H4><A NAME="Multiple_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Multiple_tables">3.3.4.9  Using More Than one Table</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX410"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>pet</CODE> table keeps track of which pets you have.  If you want to
record other information about them, such as events in their lives like
visits to the vet or when litters are born, you need another table.  What
should this table look like? It needs:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To contain the pet name so you know which animal each event pertains
to.

<LI>

A date so you know when the event occurred.

<LI>

A field to describe the event.

<LI>

An event type field, if you want to be able to categorise events.
</UL>

<P>
Given these considerations, the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement for the
<CODE>event</CODE> table might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE event (name VARCHAR(20), date DATE,
    -&#62; type VARCHAR(15), remark VARCHAR(255));
</PRE>

<P>
As with the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, it's easiest to load the initial records
by creating a tab-delimited text file containing the information:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TABLE>

<P>
Load the records like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "event.txt" INTO TABLE event;
</PRE>

<P>
Based on what you've learned from the queries you've run on the <CODE>pet</CODE>
table, you should be able to perform retrievals on the records in the
<CODE>event</CODE> table; the principles are the same.  But when is the
<CODE>event</CODE> table by itself insufficient to answer questions you might ask?

</P>
<P>
Suppose you want to find out the ages at which each pet had its
litters. We saw earlier how to calculate ages from two dates.
The litter date of the mother is in the
<CODE>event</CODE> table, but to calculate her age on that date you need her
birth date, which is stored in the <CODE>pet</CODE> table.
This means the query requires both tables:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT pet.name,
    -&#62; (YEAR(date)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(date,5)&#60;RIGHT(birth,5)) AS age,
    -&#62; remark
    -&#62; FROM pet, event
    -&#62; WHERE pet.name = event.name AND type = "litter";
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| name   | age  | remark                      |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| Fluffy |    2 | 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male |
| Buffy  |    4 | 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male |
| Buffy  |    5 | 3 puppies, 3 female         |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
There are several things to note about this query:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause lists two tables because the query needs to pull
information from both of them.

<LI>

When combining (joining) information from multiple tables, you need to
specify how records in one table can be matched to records in the other.
This is easy because they both have a <CODE>name</CODE> column.  The query uses
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to match up records in the two tables based on the
<CODE>name</CODE> values.

<LI>

Because the <CODE>name</CODE> column occurs in both tables, you must be specific
about which table you mean when referring to the column.  This is done
by prepending the table name to the column name.
</UL>

<P>
You need not have two different tables to perform a join.  Sometimes it is
useful to join a table to itself, if you want to compare records in a table
to other records in that same table.  For example, to find breeding pairs
among your pets, you can join the <CODE>pet</CODE> table with itself to produce
candidate pairs of males and females of like species:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT p1.name, p1.sex, p2.name, p2.sex, p1.species
    -&#62; FROM pet AS p1, pet AS p2
    -&#62; WHERE p1.species = p2.species AND p1.sex = "f" AND p2.sex = "m";
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| name   | sex  | name   | sex  | species |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| Fluffy | f    | Claws  | m    | cat     |
| Buffy  | f    | Fang   | m    | dog     |
| Buffy  | f    | Bowser | m    | dog     |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
In this query, we specify aliases for the table name in order
to refer to the columns and keep straight which instance of the table
each column reference is associated with.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX413"></A>

</P>
<P>
What if you forget the name of a database or table, or what the structure of
a given table is (for example, what its columns are called)?  MySQL
addresses this problem through several statements that provide information
about the databases and tables it supports.

</P>
<P>
You have already seen <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>, which lists the databases
managed by the server.  To find out which database is currently selected,
use the <CODE>DATABASE()</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATABASE();
+------------+
| DATABASE() |
+------------+
| menagerie  |
+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
If you haven't selected any database yet, the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>
(or the empty string before MySQL 4.1.1).

</P>
<P>
To find out what tables the current database contains (for example, when
you're not sure about the name of a table), use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| event               |
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>
command is useful; it displays information about each of a table's columns:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>Field</CODE> indicates the column name, <CODE>Type</CODE> is the datatype for
the column, <CODE>NULL</CODE> indicates whether the column can contain
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values, <CODE>Key</CODE> indicates whether the column is
indexed, and <CODE>Default</CODE> specifies the column's default value.

</P>
<P>
If you have indexes on a table,
<CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE> produces information about them.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Batch_mode" HREF="manual_toc.html#Batch_mode">3.5  Using <CODE>mysql</CODE> in Batch Mode</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX416"></A>
<A NAME="IDX417"></A>
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the previous sections, you used <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively to enter
queries and view the results.  You can also run <CODE>mysql</CODE> in batch
mode.  To do this, put the commands you want to run in a file, then
tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its input from the file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file
</PRE>

<P>
If you are running <CODE>mysql</CODE> under Windows and have some special
characters in the file that cause problems, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
dos&#62; mysql -e "source batch-file"
</PRE>

<P>
If you need to specify connection parameters on the command line, the
command might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p &#60; batch-file
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>mysql</CODE> this way, you are creating a script file, then
executing the script.

</P>
<P>
If you want the script to continue even if some of the statements in it
produce errors, you should
use the <CODE>--force</CODE> command-line option.

</P>
<P>
Why use a script?  Here are a few reasons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you run a query repeatedly (say, every day or every week), making it a
script allows you to avoid retyping it each time you execute it.

<LI>

You can generate new queries from existing ones that are similar by copying
and editing script files.

<LI>

Batch mode can also be useful while you're developing a query, particularly
for multiple-line commands or multiple-statement sequences of commands.  If
you make a mistake, you don't have to retype everything.  Just edit your
script to correct the error, then tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to execute it again.

<LI>

If you have a query that produces a lot of output, you can run the output
through a pager rather than watching it scroll off the top of your screen:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file | more
</PRE>

<LI>

You can catch the output in a file for further processing:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file &#62; mysql.out
</PRE>

<LI>

You can distribute your script to other people so they can run the commands,
too.

<LI>

Some situations do not allow for interactive use, for example, when you run
a query from a <CODE>cron</CODE> job.  In this case, you must use batch mode.
</UL>

<P>
The default output format is different (more concise) when you run
<CODE>mysql</CODE> in batch mode than when you use it interactively.  For
example, the output of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT species FROM pet</CODE> looks like
this when <CODE>mysql</CODE> is run interactively:

</P>

<PRE>
+---------+
| species |
+---------+
| bird    |
| cat     |
| dog     |
| hamster |
| snake   |
+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
In batch mode, the output looks like this instead:

</P>

<PRE>
species
bird
cat
dog
hamster
snake
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to get the interactive output format in batch mode, use
<CODE>mysql -t</CODE>.  To echo to the output the commands that are executed, use
<CODE>mysql -vvv</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can also use scripts from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> prompt by
using the <CODE>source</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; source filename;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX419"></A>
<A NAME="IDX420"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here are examples of how to solve some common problems with
MySQL.

</P>
<P>
Some of the examples use the table <CODE>shop</CODE> to hold the price of each
article (item number) for certain traders (dealers).  Supposing that each
trader has a single fixed price per article, then (<CODE>article</CODE>,
<CODE>dealer</CODE>) is a primary key for the records.

</P>
<P>
Start the command-line tool <CODE>mysql</CODE> and select a database:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql your-database-name
</PRE>

<P>
(In most MySQL installations, you can use the database name <CODE>test</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
You can create and populate the example table with these statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE shop (
    -&#62; article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
    -&#62; dealer  CHAR(20)                 DEFAULT ''     NOT NULL,
    -&#62; price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL,
    -&#62; PRIMARY KEY(article, dealer));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO shop VALUES
    -&#62; (1,'A',3.45),(1,'B',3.99),(2,'A',10.99),(3,'B',1.45),(3,'C',1.69),
    -&#62; (3,'D',1.25),(4,'D',19.95);
</PRE>

<P>
After issuing the statements, the table should have the following contents:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM shop;
+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | A      |  3.45 |
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | B      |  1.45 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0003 | D      |  1.25 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+

<P>
``Find number, dealer, and price of the most expensive article.''

</P>
<P>
In SQL-99 (and MySQL Version 4.1) this is easily done with a subquery:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop);
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL versions prior to 4.1, just do it in two steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Get the maximum price value from the table with a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop;
+------------+
| MAX(price) |
+------------+
|      19.95 |
+------------+
</PRE>

<LI>

Using the value 19.95 shown by the previous query to be the maximum
article price, write a query to locate and display the corresponding record:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT article, dealer, price
    -&#62; FROM   shop
    -&#62; WHERE  price=19.95;
+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Another solution is to sort all rows descending by price and only
get the first row using the MySQL-specific <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:  If there were several most expensive articles, each with a
price of 19.95, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> solution would show only one of them!

``For each article, find the dealer(s) with the most expensive price.''

</P>
<P>
In SQL-99 (and MySQL Version 4.1 or greater), the problem can be solved
with a subquery like this:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop s1
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(s2.price)
              FROM shop s2
              WHERE s1.article = s2.article);
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL versions prior to 4.1, it's best do it in several steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Get the list of (article,maxprice) pairs.
<LI>

For each article, get the corresponding rows that have the stored maximum
price.
</OL>

<P>
This can easily be done with a temporary table and a join:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp (
        article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
        price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL);

LOCK TABLES shop READ;

INSERT INTO tmp SELECT article, MAX(price) FROM shop GROUP BY article;

SELECT shop.article, dealer, shop.price FROM shop, tmp
WHERE shop.article=tmp.article AND shop.price=tmp.price;

UNLOCK TABLES;

DROP TABLE tmp;
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't use a <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table, you must also lock the <CODE>tmp</CODE>
table.

</P>
<P>
``Can it be done with a single query?''

</P>
<P>
Yes, but only by using a quite inefficient trick called the
``MAX-CONCAT trick'':

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article,
       SUBSTRING( MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 7) AS dealer,
  0.00+LEFT(      MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 6) AS price
FROM   shop
GROUP BY article;

+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The last example can, of course, be made a bit more efficient by doing the
splitting of the concatenated column in the client.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="example-user-variables" HREF="manual_toc.html#example-user-variables">3.6.5  Using User Variables</A></H3>

<P>
You can use MySQL user variables to remember results without
having to store them in temporary variables in the client.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Variables">6.1.4  User Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
For example, to find the articles with the highest and lowest price you
can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT @min_price:=MIN(price),@max_price:=MAX(price) FROM shop;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM shop WHERE price=@min_price OR price=@max_price;

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 3.23.44 and up, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support checking of
foreign key constraints. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>.
See also section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys">1.7.4.5  Foreign Keys</A>.

</P>
<P>
You don't actually need foreign keys to join 2 tables.
For table types other than <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>),
the only things MySQL currently doesn't do are 1)
<CODE>CHECK</CODE> to make sure that the keys you use
really exist in the table(s) you're referencing and 2)
automatically delete rows from a table with a foreign key
definition. Using your keys to join tables will work just fine:

</P>

<P>
MySQL doesn't yet optimise when you search on two different
keys combined with <CODE>OR</CODE> (searching on one key with different <CODE>OR</CODE>
parts is optimised quite well):

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table
WHERE field1_index = '1' OR  field2_index = '1'
</PRE>

<P>
The reason is that we haven't yet had time to come up with an efficient
way to handle this in the general case. (The <CODE>AND</CODE> handling is,
in comparison, now completely general and works very well.)

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0 and up, you can solve this problem efficiently by using a
<CODE>UNION</CODE> that combines the output of two separate <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#UNION">6.4.1.2  <CODE>UNION</CODE> Syntax</A>.
Each <CODE>SELECT</CODE> searches only one key and can be optimised:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1'
UNION
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
</PRE>

<P>
Prior to MySQL 4.0, you can achieve the same effect by using a
<CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table and separate <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.
This type of optimisation is also very good if
you are using very complicated queries where the SQL server does the
optimisations in the wrong order.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1';
INSERT INTO tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
SELECT * from tmp;
DROP TABLE tmp;
</PRE>

<P>
The above way to solve this query is in effect a <CODE>UNION</CODE> of two queries.

The following example shows how you can use the bit group functions
to calculate the number of days per month a user has visited a web page.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 (year YEAR(4), month INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL,
             day INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2000,1,1),(2000,1,20),(2000,1,30),(2000,2,2),
            (2000,2,23),(2000,2,23);
</PRE>

<P>
The example table contains year-month-day values representing visits by users
to the page. To determine how many different days in each month these visits
occur, use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT year,month,BIT_COUNT(BIT_OR(1&#60;&#60;day)) AS days FROM t1
       GROUP BY year,month;
</PRE>

<P>
Which returns:

</P>

<PRE>
+------+-------+------+
| year | month | days |
+------+-------+------+
| 2000 |    01 |    3 |
| 2000 |    02 |    2 |
+------+-------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The query calculates how many different days appear in the table for each
year/month combination, with automatic removal of duplicate entries.

The <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> attribute can be used to generate a unique
identity for new rows:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE animals (
             id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,

+----+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can retrieve the most recent <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value with the
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> SQL function or the <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> C API
function.
Note: For a multiple-row insert,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>/<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> will actually return the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> key from the <STRONG>first</STRONG> of the inserted rows.
This allows multiple-row inserts to be reproduced correctly on other servers
in a replication setup.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables you can specify <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
on a secondary column in a multiple-column index.  In this case, the generated
value for the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column is calculated as
<CODE>MAX(auto_increment_column)+1) WHERE prefix=given-prefix</CODE>.  This is
useful when you want to put data into ordered groups.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE animals (
             grp ENUM('fish','mammal','bird') NOT NULL,
             id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

+--------+----+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in this case (when the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column is part of a
multiple-column index), <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> values will be reused if you
delete the row with the biggest <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value in any group.
This happens even for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, for which <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>

At Analytikerna and Lentus, we have been doing the systems and field work
for a big research project. This project is a collaboration between the
Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet Stockholm
and the Section on Clinical Research in Aging and Psychology at the
University of Southern California.

</P>
<P>
The project involves a screening part where all twins in Sweden older
than 65 years are interviewed by telephone. Twins who meet certain
criteria are passed on to the next stage. In this latter stage, twins who
want to participate are visited by a doctor/nurse team. Some of the
examinations include physical and neuropsychological examination,
laboratory testing, neuroimaging, psychological status assessment, and family
history collection. In addition, data are collected on medical and
environmental risk factors.

Some explanations:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CONCAT(p1.id, p1.tvab) + 0 AS tvid</CODE>
<DD>
We want to sort on the concatenated <CODE>id</CODE> and <CODE>tvab</CODE> in
numerical order. Adding <CODE>0</CODE> to the result causes MySQL to
treat the result as a number.
<DT>column <CODE>id</CODE>
<DD>
This identifies a pair of twins. It is a key in all tables.
<DT>column <CODE>tvab</CODE>
<DD>
This identifies a twin in a pair. It has a value of <CODE>1</CODE> or <CODE>2</CODE>.
<DT>column <CODE>ptvab</CODE>
<DD>
This is an inverse of <CODE>tvab</CODE>. When <CODE>tvab</CODE> is <CODE>1</CODE> this is
<CODE>2</CODE>, and vice versa. It exists to save typing and to make it easier for
MySQL to optimise the query.
</DL>

<P>
This query demonstrates, among other things, how to do lookups on a
table from the same table with a join (<CODE>p1</CODE> and <CODE>p2</CODE>). In the example, this
is used to check whether a twin's partner died before the age of 65. If so,
the row is not returned.

</P>
<P>
All of the above exist in all tables with twin-related information. We
have a key on both <CODE>id,tvab</CODE> (all tables), and <CODE>id,ptvab</CODE>
(<CODE>person_data</CODE>) to make queries faster.

</P>
<P>
On our production machine (A 200MHz UltraSPARC), this query returns
about 150-200 rows and takes less than one second.

<P>
There are programs that let you authenticate your users from a MySQL
database and also let you write your log files into a MySQL table.

</P>
<P>
You can change the Apache logging format to be easily readable by
MySQL by putting the following into the Apache configuration file:

</P>

<PRE>
LogFormat \
        "\"%h\",%{%Y%m%d%H%M%S}t,%&#62;s,\"%b\",\"%{Content-Type}o\",  \
        \"%U\",\"%{Referer}i\",\"%{User-Agent}i\""
</PRE>

<P>
To load a log file in that format into MySQL, you can use a statement
something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
LOAD DATA INFILE '/local/access_log' INTO TABLE table_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' ESCAPED BY '\\'
</PRE>

<P>
The named table should be created to have columns that correspond to those
that the <CODE>LogFormat</CODE> line writes to the log file.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--ansi</CODE>
<DD>
Use SQL-99 syntax instead of MySQL syntax.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<DT><CODE>-b, --basedir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to installation directory. All paths are usually resolved relative to
this.

<DT><CODE>--big-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on file.  It solves
most 'table full' errors, but also slows down the queries where
in-memory tables would suffice.  Since Version 3.23.2, MySQL is
able to solve it automatically by using memory for small temporary
tables and switching to disk tables where necessary.

<DT><CODE>--bind-address=IP</CODE>
<DD>
IP address to bind to.

<DT><CODE>--console</CODE>
<DD>
Write the error log messages to stderr/stdout even if <CODE>--log-error</CODE>
is specified.  On Windows, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will not close the console screen if
this option is used.

<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<DT><CODE>--chroot=path</CODE>
<DD>
Put <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon in chroot environment at startup. Recommended
security measure since MySQL 4.0 (MySQL 3.23 is not able to provide
100% closed chroot jail).
It somewhat limits <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> though.

<DT><CODE>--core-file</CODE>
<DD>
Write a core file if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies.  For some systems you must also
specify <CODE>--core-file-size</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.
Note that on some systems, like Solaris, you will
not get a core file if you are also using the <CODE>--user</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>-h, --datadir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to the database root.

<DT><CODE>--debug[...]=</CODE>
<DD>
If MySQL is configured with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, you can use this
option to get a trace file of what <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is doing.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

<DT><CODE>--default-character-set=charset</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default character set.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<DT><CODE>--default-table-type=type</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default table type for tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<DT><CODE>--delay-key-write[= OFF | ON | ALL]</CODE>
<DD>
How MyISAM <CODE>DELAYED KEYS</CODE> should be used. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--delay-key-write-for-all-tables;  In MySQL 4.0.3 you should use --delay-key-write=ALL instead.</CODE>
<DD>
Don't flush key buffers between writes for any <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--des-key-file=filename</CODE>
<DD>
Read the default keys used by <CODE>DES_ENCRYPT()</CODE> and <CODE>DES_DECRYPT()</CODE>
from this file.

<DT><CODE>--enable-external-locking (was --enable-locking)</CODE>
<DD>
Enable system locking.  Note that if you use this option on a system on
which <CODE>lockd</CODE> does not fully work (as on Linux), you will easily get
mysqld to deadlock.

<DT><CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>
<DD>
Enable support for named pipes (only on NT/Win2000/XP).

<DT><CODE>-T, --exit-info</CODE>
<DD>
This is a bit mask of different flags one can use for debugging the
mysqld server; one should not use this option if one doesn't know
exactly what it does!

<DT><CODE>--flush</CODE>
<DD>
Flush all changes to disk after each SQL command.  Normally MySQL
only does a write of all changes to disk after each SQL command and lets
the operating system handle the syncing to disk.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display short help and exit.

<DT><CODE>--init-file=file</CODE>
<DD>
Read SQL commands from this file at startup.

<DT><CODE>-L, --language=...</CODE>
<DD>
Client error messages in given language.  May be given as a full path.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Languages">4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages</A>.

<DT><CODE>-l, --log[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log connections and queries to file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-bin=[file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all queries that change data to the file. Used for backup and replication.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-bin-index[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Index file for binary log file names. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-error[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log errors and startup messages to this file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-isam[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all ISAM/MyISAM changes to file (only used when debugging ISAM/MyISAM).

<DT><CODE>--log-long-format</CODE>
<DD>
Log some extra information to the logfiles (update log, binary update log, and slow queries log, whatever log has been activated). For example, username and timestamp are logged for queries. If you are using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE> and <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE>, then also  queries that are not using indexes are logged to the slow query log.  Note that <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> is deprecated as of MySQL version  4.1, when <CODE>--log-short-format</CODE> was introduced (the long log format is the default setting since version 4.1). Also note that starting with MySQL 4.1 the <CODE>--log-queries-not-using-indexes</CODE> option is available for the purpose of logging queries that do not use indexes to the slow queries log.

<DT><CODE>--log-queries-not-using-indexes</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, then also queries that are not using indexes are logged to the slow query log. This option is available as of MySQL 4.1. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-short-format</CODE>
<DD>
Log less information to the logfiles (update log, binary update log, and slow queries log, whatever log has been activated). For example, username and timestamp are not logged for queries. This options was introduced in MySQL 4.1.

<DT><CODE>--log-slow-queries[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all queries that have taken more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds to execute to file. Note that the default for the amount of information logged has changed in MySQL 4.1. See the <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> and <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> options for details. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-update[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log updates to <CODE>file.#</CODE> where <CODE>#</CODE> is a unique number if not
given. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>. The update log is deprecated and will be
removed in MySQL 5.0; you should use the binary log instead
(<CODE>--log-bin</CODE>). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>. Starting from version 5.0,
using <CODE>--log-update</CODE> will just turn on the binlog instead.

<DT><CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>
<DD>
Table-modifying operations (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>/<CODE>DELETE</CODE>/<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>)
will have lower priority than selects.  It can also be done via
<CODE>{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...</CODE> to lower
the priority of only one query, or by
<CODE>SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1</CODE> to change the priority in one
thread.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A>.

<DT><CODE>--memlock</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process in memory.  This works only if your
system supports the <CODE>mlockall()</CODE> system call (like Solaris).  This
may help if you have a problem where the operating system is causing
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to swap on disk.
Note that use of this option requires that you run the server as <CODE>root</CODE>,
which is normally not a good idea for security reasons.

<DT><CODE>--myisam-recover [=option[,option...]]]</CODE>
<DD>
Option is any combination
of <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>, <CODE>BACKUP</CODE>, <CODE>FORCE</CODE> or <CODE>QUICK</CODE>.  You can
also set this explicitly to <CODE>""</CODE> if you want to disable this
option. If this option is used, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will on open check if the
table is marked as crashed or if the table wasn't closed properly.
(The last option only works if you are running with
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>.)  If this is the case <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will run
check on the table. If the table was corrupted, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
attempt to repair it.

The following options affects how the repair works.

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>DEFAULT </TD><TD> The same as not giving any option to
                    <CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>BACKUP </TD><TD> If the data table was changed during recover, save a
                    backup of the <TT>`table_name.MYD'</TT> datafile as
                    <TT>`table_name-datetime.BAK'</TT>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>FORCE </TD><TD> Run recover even if we will lose more than one row
                    from the .MYD file.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>QUICK </TD><TD> Don't check the rows in the table if there aren't any
                    delete blocks.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Before a table is automatically repaired, MySQL will add a note
about this in the error log.  If you want to be able to recover from most
things without user intervention, you should use the options
<CODE>BACKUP,FORCE</CODE>.  This will force a repair of a table even if some rows
would be deleted, but it will keep the old datafile as a backup so that
you can later examine what happened.

<DT><CODE>--new</CODE>
<DD>
From version 4.0.12, the <CODE>--new</CODE> option can be used to make the server
behave as 4.1 in certain aspects, easing a 4.0 to 4.1 upgrade:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is returned as a string with the format
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>.
</UL>

<DT><CODE>--pid-file=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to pid file used by <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to listen for TCP/IP connections.

<DT><CODE>-o, --old-protocol</CODE>
<DD>
Use the 3.20 protocol for compatibility with some very old clients.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-from-3.20">2.5.5  Upgrading from Version 3.20 to 3.21</A>.

<DT><CODE>--one-thread</CODE>
<DD>
Only use one thread (for debugging under Linux).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<DT><CODE>--open-files-limit=</CODE>
<DD>
To change the number of file descriptors available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
If this is not set or set to 0, then <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will use this value
to reserve file descriptors to use with <CODE>setrlimit()</CODE>.  If this
value is 0 then <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will reserve <CODE>max_connections*5</CODE> or
<CODE>max_connections + table_cache*2</CODE> (whichever is larger) number of
files.  You should try increasing this if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gives you the
error 'Too many open files'.

<DT><CODE>-O, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Give a variable a value. <CODE>--help</CODE> lists variables.  You can find a full
description for all variables in the <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> section in this
manual.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.  The tuning server parameters section includes
information of how to optimise these. Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE>
is deprecated since MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--var=option</CODE> on its own.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

In MySQL 4.0.2 one can set a variable directly with
<CODE>--variable-name=option</CODE> and <CODE>set-variable</CODE> is no longer needed
in option files.

If you want to restrict the maximum value a startup option can be set to
with <CODE>SET</CODE>, you can define this by using the
<CODE>--maximum-variable-name</CODE> command line option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Note that when setting a variable to a value, MySQL may automatically
correct it to stay within a given range and also adjusts the value a
little to fix for the used algorithm.

<DT><CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>
<DD>
Skip some optimise stages.

<DT><CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
With this option, the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command returns only those
databases for which the user has some kind of privilege.
From version 4.0.2 this option is deprecated and doesn't do anything
(the option is enabled by default) as we now have the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-user-create</CODE>
<DD>
If this is enabled, a user can't create new users with the GRANT
command, if the user doesn't have <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege to the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table or any column in this table.

<DT><CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE>
<DD>
Disable usage of BDB tables. This will save memory and may speed up some
things.

<DT><CODE>--skip-concurrent-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Turn off the ability to select and insert at the same time on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables. (This is only to be used if you think you have found a bug in this
feature.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-delay-key-write</CODE>
<DD>
In MySQL 4.0.3 you should use --delay-key-write=OFF instead.
Ignore the <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> option for all tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
<DD>
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all.  This
gives everyone <STRONG>full access</STRONG> to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>
<DD>
Never use host name cache for faster name-ip resolution, but query DNS server
on every connect instead.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-innodb</CODE>
<DD>
Disable usage of Innodb tables.  This will save memory and disk space and
speed up some things.

<DT><CODE>--skip-external-locking (was --skip-locking)</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use system locking.  To use <CODE>isamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> you must
shut down the server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Stability">1.2.3  How Stable Is MySQL?</A>.  Note that in MySQL Version
3.23 you can use <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> and <CODE>CHECK</CODE> to repair/check <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.

<DT><CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>
<DD>
Hostnames are not resolved.  All <CODE>Host</CODE> column values in the grant tables
must be IP numbers or <CODE>localhost</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't listen for TCP/IP connections at all.  All interaction with
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> must be made via named pipes or Unix sockets.  This option is highly
recommended for systems where only local requests are allowed.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-new</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use new, possibly wrong routines.

<DT><CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
<DD>
Deprecated option in 4.0.13;  use <CODE>--skip-symbolic-links</CODE> instead.

<DT><CODE>--symbolic-links, --skip-symbolic-links</CODE>
<DD>
Enable or disable symbolic link support. This option has different effects on
Windows and Unix.

On Windows, enabling symbolic links allows you to establish a symbolic
link to a database directory by creating a
<CODE>directory.sym</CODE> file that contains the path to the real directory.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_symbolic_links">2.6.1.5  Distributing Data Across Different Disks on Windows</A>.

On Unix, enabling symbolic links means that you can link a
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> index file or datafile to another directory with
the <CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE> or <CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> options of the
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  If you delete or rename the table,
the files that its symbolic links point to also will be deleted or
renamed.

<DT><CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE>
<DD>
If MySQL is configured with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, all programs
check memory for overruns for every memory allocation and memory
freeing operations.  This checking is very slow, so for the server you
can avoid it when you don't need it by using the <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE>
option.

<DT><CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command, unless the user has the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege.

<DT><CODE>--skip-stack-trace</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write stack traces.  This option is useful when you are running
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> under a debugger. On some systems, you also must use
this option to get a core file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-thread-priority</CODE>
<DD>
Disable using thread priorities for faster response time.

<DT><CODE>--socket=path</CODE>
<DD>
On Unix, the socket file to
use for local connections (default <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT>).
On Windows, the pipe name to use for local connections that use a
named pipe (default <CODE>MySql</CODE>).

<DT><CODE>--sql-mode=value[,value[,value...]]</CODE>
<DD>
The option values can be any combination of: <CODE>REAL_AS_FLOAT</CODE>,
<CODE>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</CODE>, <CODE>ANSI_QUOTES</CODE>, <CODE>IGNORE_SPACE</CODE>,
<CODE>ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_TABLE_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_FIELD_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_KEY_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</CODE>,
<CODE>MYSQL323</CODE>,
<CODE>MYSQL40</CODE>,
<CODE>DB2</CODE>,
<CODE>MAXDB</CODE>,
<CODE>MSSQL</CODE>,
<CODE>ORACLE</CODE>,
<CODE>POSTGRESQL</CODE>,
or
<CODE>ANSI</CODE>.
The value also can be empty
(<CODE>--sql-mode=""</CODE>) if you want to reset it.

<CODE>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE> affects handling of <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
columns. Normally, you generate the next sequence number for the column by
inserting either <CODE>NULL</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE> into it. <CODE>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE>
suppresses this behaviour for <CODE>0</CODE> so that only <CODE>NULL</CODE> generates
the next sequence number. This mode can be useful if <CODE>0</CODE> has been
stored in a table's <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column (this is not recommended,
by the way).  For example, if you dump the table with <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and
then reload it, normally MySQL will generate new sequence numbers when it
encounters the <CODE>0</CODE> values, resulting in a table with different contents
than the one that was dumped. Enabling <CODE>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE> before
reloading the dump file solves this problem. (As of MySQL 4.1.1, when this
option value became available, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> automatically includes
dump output to enable <CODE>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE>.)

Several of the option values are used for compatibility with other servers.
If specified, they cause the server to omit from the output of <CODE>SHOW
CREATE TABLE</CODE> those parts of the statement that are not understood by
earlier versions of MySQL or other database servers.
Using these option values results in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statements that are
more portable for use with other servers:


<UL>

<LI>

The
<CODE>NO_TABLE_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_FIELD_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</CODE>,
and
<CODE>NO_KEY_OPTIONS</CODE> values cause omission of table options, or options
pertaining to column or index definitions.

<LI>

The values <CODE>MYSQL323</CODE> and <CODE>MYSQL40</CODE> are for compatibility with
MySQL 3.23 and MySQL 4.0.

<LI>

The values used for compatibility with other servers are
<CODE>DB2</CODE>,
<CODE>MAXDB</CODE>,
<CODE>MSSQL</CODE>,
<CODE>ORACLE</CODE>,
and
<CODE>POSTGRESQL</CODE>.

</UL>

These options also affect the output of <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, because that program
uses <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> to obtain the table-creation statements that it
includes in its own output.

Several of the option values have a complex effect because they are shorthand
for a group or set of values.
For example, you can tell the server to run in ANSI mode by using the
<CODE>--sql-mode=ANSI</CODE> (or <CODE>--ansi</CODE>) option, which is
equivalent to specifying both of the following command-line
options:


<PRE>
--sql-mode=REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE
</PRE>

Note that specifying ANSI mode in this way also has the effect of setting
the transaction isolation level.
For more information about running the server in ANSI mode, see section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

Other ``group'' values are
<CODE>DB2</CODE>,
<CODE>MAXDB</CODE>,
<CODE>MSSQL</CODE>,
<CODE>ORACLE</CODE>,
and
<CODE>POSTGRESQL</CODE>.
Specifying any of them turns on the
<CODE>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</CODE>,
<CODE>ANSI_QUOTES</CODE>,
<CODE>IGNORE_SPACE</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_TABLE_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_FIELD_OPTIONS</CODE>,
and
<CODE>NO_KEY_OPTIONS</CODE>
values.

The <CODE>--sql-mode</CODE> option was added in MySQL 3.23.41.
The <CODE>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> value was added in 4.0.0.
<CODE>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</CODE> was added in 4.0.15.
<CODE>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_TABLE_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_FIELD_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>NO_KEY_OPTIONS</CODE>,
<CODE>MYSQL323</CODE>,
<CODE>MYSQL40</CODE>,
<CODE>DB2</CODE>,
<CODE>MAXDB</CODE>,
<CODE>MSSQL</CODE>,
<CODE>ORACLE</CODE>,
<CODE>POSTGRESQL</CODE>,
and
<CODE>ANSI</CODE>
were added in 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>--temp-pool</CODE>
<DD>
Using this option will cause most temporary files created by the
server to use a small set of names, rather than a unique name for
each new file. This is to work around a problem in the Linux kernel
dealing with creating many
new files with different names. With the old behaviour, Linux seems to
``leak'' memory, as it's being allocated to the directory entry cache
rather than to the disk cache.

<DT><CODE>--transaction-isolation={ READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE }</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the default transaction isolation level.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_TRANSACTION">6.7.6  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-t, --tmpdir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path of the directory to use for creating temporary files. It may be useful
if your default <CODE>/tmp</CODE>
directory resides on a partition that is too small to hold temporary tables.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, this option accepts several paths that are used in
round-robin fashion. Paths should be separated by colon characters (<SAMP>`:'</SAMP>)
on Unix and semicolon characters (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) on Windows.
It is possible to set <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to point to a memory-based filesystem,
except if the MySQL server is a slave. If it is a slave, it needs some
of its temporary files (for replication of temporary tables or of
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>) to survive a machine's reboot, so a
memory-based <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> which is cleared when the machine reboots is not
suitable; a disk-based <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> is necessary.

<DT><CODE>-u, --user={user_name | user_id}</CODE>
<DD>
Run the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server as the user having the name <CODE>user_name</CODE> or
numeric user ID <CODE>user_id</CODE>.
(``User'' in this context refers to a system login account, not a MySQL user
listed in the grant tables.)

This option is <STRONG>mandatory</STRONG> when starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE>.
The server will change its user ID during its startup sequence, causing it
to run as that particular user rather than as <CODE>root</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A>.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.56 and 4.0.12:
To avoid a possible security hole where a user adds a <CODE>--user=root</CODE>
option to some <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file (thus causing the server to run as
<CODE>root</CODE>), <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses only the first
<CODE>--user</CODE> option specified and produces a warning if there are multiple
<CODE>--user</CODE> options. Options in <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> and
<TT>`datadir/my.cnf'</TT> are processed before
command-line options, so it is recommended that you
put a <CODE>--user</CODE> option in <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> and specify a value other than
<CODE>root</CODE>. The option in <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> will be found before any other
<CODE>--user</CODE> options, which ensures that the server runs as a user other
than <CODE>root</CODE>, and that a warning results if any other <CODE>--user</CODE> option
is found.

<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Display version information and exit.

<DT><CODE>-W, --log-warnings</CODE>
<DD>
Print out warnings like <CODE>Aborted connection...</CODE> to the
<TT>`.err'</TT> file. Enabling this option is recommended, for example, if you
use replication (you will get more information about what is happening,
such as messages about network failures and reconnections). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Communication_errors">A.2.10  Communication Errors / Aborted Connection</A>.

This option used to be called <CODE>--warnings</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
You can change most values for a running server with the
<CODE>SET</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<CODE>DATADIR</CODE> is the MySQL data directory (typically
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary installation or
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source installation).  Note that this is the
directory that was specified at configuration time, not the one specified
with <CODE>--datadir</CODE> when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up!  (<CODE>--datadir</CODE> has no
effect on where the server looks for option files, because the server looks
for files before it processes any command-line arguments.)

</P>
<P>
Note that on Windows you should specify all paths in option files with
<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>. If you use <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, you need to specify it
twice, because <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> is the escape character in MySQL.

MySQL tries to read option files in the order listed above.  If
multiple option files exist, an option specified in a file read later takes
precedence over the same option specified in a file read earlier.  Options
specified on the command-line take precedence over options specified in any
option file.  Some options can be specified using environment variables.
Options specified on the command-line or in option files take precedence over
environment variable values. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following programs support option files:  <CODE>mysql</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, and <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Since Version 4.0.2, you can use the <CODE>loose</CODE> prefix for command-line 
options (or options in my.cnf). If an option is prefixed by <CODE>loose</CODE>, the
program reading it will not exit with an error if an option is unknown, but 
will rather only issue a warning:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --loose-no-such-option
</PRE>

<P>
Any long option that may be given on the command-line when running a MySQL
program can be given in an option file as well (without the leading double
dash).  Run the program with the <CODE>--help</CODE> option to get a list of
available options.

</P>
<P>
An option file can contain lines of the following forms:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>#comment</CODE>
<DD>
Comment lines start with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>. Empty lines are ignored.

<DT><CODE>[group]</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>group</CODE> is the name of the program or group for which you want to set
options.  After a group line, any <CODE>option</CODE> or <CODE>set-variable</CODE> lines
apply to the named group until the end of the option file or another group
line is given.

<DT><CODE>option</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--option</CODE> on the command-line.

<DT><CODE>option=value</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--option=value</CODE> on the command-line.

<DT><CODE>set-variable = variable=value</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--set-variable variable=value</CODE> on the command-line.
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is deprecated since MySQL 4.0;
as of that version, program variable names can be used as option names.
On the command line, just use <CODE>--variable=value</CODE>. In an option file, use
<CODE>variable=value</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>[client]</CODE> group allows you to specify options that apply to all
MySQL clients (not <CODE>mysqld</CODE>). This is the perfect group to use
to specify the password that you use to connect to the server.  (But make
sure the option file is readable and writable only by yourself.)

</P>
<P>
Note that for options and values, all leading and trailing blanks are
automatically deleted.  You may use the escape sequences <SAMP>`\b'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`\t'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`\s'</SAMP> in your value string

If you have a source distribution, you will find sample configuration
files named <TT>`my-xxxx.cnf'</TT> in the <TT>`support-files'</TT> directory.
If you have a binary distribution, look in the <TT>`DIR/support-files'</TT>
directory, where <CODE>DIR</CODE> is the pathname to the MySQL
installation directory (typically <TT>`C:\mysql'</TT> or <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>).  Currently
there are sample configuration files for small, medium, large, and very
large systems.  You can copy <TT>`my-xxxx.cnf'</TT> to your home directory
(rename the copy to <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>) to experiment with this.

All MySQL programs that support option files support the

Note that the options just shown must be first on the command line to
work, with the exception that <CODE>--print-defaults</CODE> may be used
immediately after <CODE>--defaults-file</CODE> or <CODE>--defaults-extra-file</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note for developers:  Option file handling is implemented simply by
processing all matching options (that is, options in the appropriate group)
before any command-line arguments. This works nicely for programs that use
the last instance of an option that is specified multiple times. If you have
an old program that handles multiply specified options this way but doesn't
read option files, you need add only two lines to give it that capability.
Check the source code of any of the standard MySQL clients to see
how to do this.

</P>
<P>
In shell scripts, you can use the <CODE>my_print_defaults</CODE> command to parse the
option files. The following example shows the output that
<CODE>my_print_defaults</CODE> might produce when asked to show the options found in
the <CODE>[client]</CODE> and <CODE>[mysql]</CODE> groups:

In some cases you might want to run multiple <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers
on the same machine.  For example, you might want to test a new
MySQL release while leaving your existing production setup undisturbed.
Or you may want to give different users access to different <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
servers that they manage themselves.  (For example, you might be an
Internet service provider that wants to provide independent MySQL
installations for different customers.)

</P>
<P>
When you run multiple servers on a single machine, each server must have
unique values for several operating parameters. At least
the following options must be different for each server:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>--port=port_num</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--socket=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--shared-memory-base-name=name</CODE> (Windows only; new in MySQL 4.1)

<LI><CODE>--pid-file=path</CODE> (Unix only)

</UL>

<P>
<CODE>--port</CODE> controls the port number for TCP/IP connections.
<CODE>--socket</CODE> controls the socket file path on Unix and the name of the
named pipe on Windows. (It's necessary to specify distinct pipe names on
Windows only for those servers that support named pipe connections.)
<CODE>--shared-memory-base-name</CODE> designates the shared memory name used by a
Windows server to allow clients to connect via shared memory.
<CODE>--pid-file</CODE> indicates the name of the file in which a Unix server writes
its process ID.

</P>
<P>
If you use the following options, they must be different for each server:

</P>


<UL>
<LI><CODE>--log=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--log-bin=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--log-update=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--log-error=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--log-isam=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--bdb-logdir=path</CODE>

</UL>

<P>
If you want more performance, you can also specify the following options
differently for each server, to spread load between several physical disks:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>--tmpdir=path</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--bdb-tmpdir=path</CODE>

</UL>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
Having different temporary directories like above is also recommended
because it will be easier for you in case you want to know to which
MySQL server a certain temporary file belongs. 

</P>
<P>
Generally, each server should also use a different data directory, which is
specified using the <CODE>--datadir=path</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
If you have multiple MySQL installations in different locations, normally
you can specify the base installation directory for each server with the
<CODE>--basedir=path</CODE> option to cause each server to use a different data
directory, log files, and PID file. (The defaults for all these values are
determined relative to the base directory.) In that case, the only other
options you need to specify are the <CODE>--socket</CODE> and <CODE>--port</CODE>
options.  For example, suppose you install binary MySQL versions
(<TT>`.tar'</TT> files) in different locations and start them using the
command <CODE>./bin/mysqld_safe</CODE> under the corresponding base directory
of each installation.  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will determine the proper
<CODE>--basedir</CODE> option to pass to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, and you need specify
only the <CODE>--socket</CODE> and <CODE>--port</CODE> options to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As discussed in the following sections, it is possible to start additional
servers by setting environment variables or by specifying appropriate
command-line options.  However, if you need to run multiple servers on
a more permanent basis, it will be more convenient to use option files
to specify for each server those option values that must be unique to it.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: Normally you should never have two servers that update
data in the same databases!  If your OS doesn't support fault-free system
locking, this may lead to unpleasant surprises!  If (despite this warning)
you run multiple servers using the same data directory and they have
logging enabled, you must specify the names of the log files using the
appropriate options.  Otherwise, the servers may try to log to the same files.

</P>
<P>
This warning against sharing a data directory among servers also applies
in an NFS environment.  Allowing several MySQL servers to access a common
data directory over NFS is a <STRONG>bad idea</STRONG>!

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The primary problem is that NFS will become the speed bottleneck.
It is not meant for such use.

<LI>

You also will have to
come up with a solution how to make sure that two or more servers
do not interfere with each other. At the moment there is no platform
that will 100% reliably do the file locking in every situation (usually
this is handled by the <CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon).  Yet there would be one
more possible risk with NFS; it would make the work even more complicated
for <CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon to handle.

</UL>

<P>
Make it easy for yourself: Forget about sharing a data directory among
servers over NFS. A better solution is to have one computer with an
operating system that efficiently handles threads and have several CPUs
in it.

<H4><A NAME="Multiple_Windows_servers" HREF="manual_toc.html#Multiple_Windows_servers">4.1.3.1  Running Multiple Servers on Windows</A></H4>

<P>
You can run multiple servers on Windows by starting them manually from the
command line, each with appropriate operating parameters. On Windows NT-based
systems, you also have the option of installing several servers as services
and running them that way. General instructions for running MySQL servers
from the command line or as services are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows">2.6.1  Windows Notes</A>. This section
describes how to make sure you start each server with different values for
those startup options that must be unique per server, such as the data
directory.  (These options are described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Multiple_servers">4.1.3  Running Multiple MySQL Servers on the Same Machine</A>.)

</P>

<H4>4.1.3.2  Starting Multiple Windows Servers at the Command Line</H4>

<P>
To start multiple servers manually from the command line, you can specify the appropriate options on
the command line or in an option file. It's more convenient to place the
options in an option file, but it's necessary to make sure that each server
gets its own set of options. To do this, create an option file for each
server and tell the server the filename with a <CODE>--defaults-file</CODE> option
when you run it.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you want to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> on port 3307 with a
data directory of <TT>`C:\mydata1'</TT>, and <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> on port 3308 with a
data directory of <TT>`C:\mydata2'</TT>. To accomplish this, create two option
files. For example, create one file <TT>`C:\my-opts1.cnf'</TT> that looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
datadir = C:/mydata1
port = 3307
</PRE>

<P>
Create a second file <TT>`C:\my-opts2.cnf'</TT> that looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
datadir = C:/mydata2
port = 3308
</PRE>

<P>
Then start each server with its own option file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
shell&#62; mysqld-max --defaults-file=C:\my-opts2.cnf
</PRE>

<P>
(On NT, the servers will start in the foreground, so you'll need to issue
those two commands in separate console windows.)

</P>
<P>
To shut down the servers, you must connect to the appropriate port number:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin --port=3307 shutdown
shell&#62; mysqladmin --port=3308 shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to allow named pipe connections in addition to TCP/IP connections,
use the <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> or <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> servers and specify options
that enable the named pipe and specify its name. (Each server must have a unique
pipe name.)  For example, the <TT>`C:\my-opts1.cnf'</TT> file might be written
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
datadir = C:/mydata1
port = 3307
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe1
</PRE>

<P>
Then start the server this way:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld-nt --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
</PRE>

<P>
<TT>`C:\my-opts2.cnf'</TT> would be modified similarly.

</P>

<H4>4.1.3.3  Starting Multiple Windows Servers as Services</H4>

<P>
On NT-based systems, you can install multiple servers as services. (This is
possible as of MySQL
4.0.2.) In this case, you must make sure that each server uses a different
service name in addition to all the other parameters that must be unique per
server.

</P>
<P>
For the following instructions, assume that you want to run <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>
servers from two different versions of MySQL that are installed at
<TT>`C:\mysql-4.0.8'</TT> and <TT>`C:\mysql-4.0.14'</TT>, respectively. (This might be
the case if you're running 4.0.8 as your production server, but want to test
4.0.14 before upgrading to it.)

</P>
<P>
The following principles are relevant when installing a MySQL service with the
<CODE>--install</CODE> (or <CODE>--install-manual</CODE>) option:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

If you specify no service name, the server uses the default service name of
<CODE>MySql</CODE> and the server reads options from the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group in
the standard option files.

<LI>

If you specify a service name after the
<CODE>--install</CODE> option, the server ignores the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> option
group and instead reads options from the group that has the same name as the
service.

<LI>

If you specify a <CODE>--defaults-file</CODE> option after the service name,
the server ignores the standard option files and reads options only from the
<CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the named file.
</UL>

<P>
These principles give you several ways to set up multiple services.
The following instructions describe some examples. Before trying any of them,
be sure you shut down and remove any existing MySQL services first.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Specify the options for all services in one of the standard option files.
To do this, use the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group for the server that is installed
under the default service name (<CODE>MySql</CODE>). For other servers, use
a group name that is the same as the service name.
Suppose you want to run the 4.0.8 <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> using the default service
name and the 4.0.14 <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> using the service name <CODE>mysqld2</CODE>.
In this case, you can use the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group for 4.0.8 and the
<CODE>[mysqld2]</CODE> group for 4.0.14.
For example, you can set up <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> like this:


<PRE>
# options for default service (MySql)
[mysqld]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.8
port = 3307
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe1

# options for mysqld2 service
[mysqld2]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.14
port = 3308
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe2
</PRE>

Install the services like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql-4.0.8\bin\mysqld-nt --install
shell&#62; C:\mysql-4.0.14\bin\mysqld-nt --install mysqld2
</PRE>

To start the services, use the services manager, or use <CODE>NET START</CODE>
with the appropriate service names:


<PRE>
shell&#62; NET START MySql
shell&#62; NET START mysqld2
</PRE>

To stop the services, use the services manager, or use <CODE>NET STOP</CODE>
with the same service names.

<LI>

Specify options for each server in separate files and use
<CODE>--defaults-file</CODE> when you install the services to tell each server
what file to use.  In this case, each file should list options using a
<CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group.

With this approach, to specify options for the 4.0.8 <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>,
create a file <TT>`C:\my-opts1.cnf'</TT> that looks like this:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.8
port = 3307
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe1
</PRE>

For the 4.0.14 <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>, create a file
<TT>`C:\my-opts2.cnf'</TT> that looks like this:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.14
port = 3308
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe2
</PRE>

Install the services as follows (enter each command on a single line):


<PRE>
shell&#62; C:\mysql-4.0.8\bin\mysqld-nt --install MySql
           --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
shell&#62; C:\mysql-4.0.14\bin\mysqld-nt --install mysqld2
           --defaults-file=C:\my-opts2.cnf
</PRE>

To use a <CODE>--defaults-file</CODE> option when you install a MySQL server as a
service, you must precede the option with the service name. That is why the
first command names the <CODE>MySql</CODE> service explicitly, even though that is
the default service name.

Start and stop the services the same way as in the preceding example.

</UL>

<P>
To remove multiple services, use <CODE>mysqld --remove</CODE> for each one,
specifying a service name following the <CODE>--remove</CODE> option if the
service to remove has a name different than the default.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Multiple_Unix_servers" HREF="manual_toc.html#Multiple_Unix_servers">4.1.3.4  Running Multiple Servers on Unix</A></H4>

<P>
The easiest way is to run multiple servers on Unix is to compile them
with different TCP/IP ports and socket files so that each one is listening on
different network interfaces. Also, by compiling in different base directories
for each installation, that automatically results in different compiled-in
data directory, log file, and PID file locations for each of your servers.

</P>
<P>
Assume an existing server is configured for the default port number and
socket file.  To configure a new server to have different operating
parameters, use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-tcp-port=port_number \
             --with-unix-socket-path=file_name \
             --prefix=/usr/local/mysql-4.0.14
</PRE>

<P>
Here <CODE>port_number</CODE> and <CODE>file_name</CODE> should be different from the
default port number and socket file pathname, and the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> value
should specify an installation directory different than the one under which
the existing MySQL installation is located.

</P>
<P>
If you have a MySQL server listening on a given port number, you can use the
following command to find out what operating parameters it is using
for several important configurable variables,
including the base directory and socket name:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin --host=host_name --port=port_number variables
</PRE>

<P>
With the information displayed by that command, you can tell what option
values <STRONG>not</STRONG> to use when configuring an additional server.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you specify ``<CODE>localhost</CODE>'' as a hostname, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
will default to using a Unix socket connection rather than TCP/IP.
In MySQL 4.1, you can explicitly specify the connection protocol to use by
using the <CODE>--protocol={TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY}</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
You don't have to compile a new MySQL server just to start with a
different socket file and TCP/IP port number.  It is also possible to specify
those values at runtime. One way to do so is by using command-line options:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; /path/to/mysqld_safe --socket=file_name --port=port_number
</PRE>

<P>
To use another database directory for the second server, pass
a <CODE>--datadir=path</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another way to achieve a similar effect is to use environment variables
to set the socket name and port number:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX449"></A>
<A NAME="IDX450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX452"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/tmp/mysqld-new.sock
shell&#62; MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3307
shell&#62; export MYSQL_UNIX_PORT MYSQL_TCP_PORT
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; bin/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
This is a quick and dirty method for starting a second server to use
for testing.  The nice thing about this method is that the environment
variable settings will apply to any client programs that you invoke from
the above shell. Thus, connections for those clients automatically will
be directed to the second server!

</P>
<P>
section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A> includes a list of other environment
variables you can use to affect <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For automatic server execution, your startup script that is executed
at boot time should execute the following command once for each
server with an appropriate option file path for each command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld_safe --defaults-file=path-to-option-file
</PRE>

<P>
Each option file should contain option values specific to a given server.

</P>
<P>
On Unix,
the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> script is another way to start multiple servers.

<P>
When you want to connect with a client program to a MySQL server that is
listening to different network interfaces than those compiled into your
client, you can use one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start the client with <CODE>--host=host_name --port=port_number</CODE> to connect
via TCP/IP to a remote host, or with <CODE>--host=localhost --socket=file_name</CODE>
to connect to a local host via a Unix socket or a Windows named pipe.

<LI>

As of MySQL 4.1, start the client with <CODE>--protocol=tcp</CODE> to connect
via TCP/IP, <CODE>--protocol=socket</CODE> to connect via a Unix socket,
<CODE>--protocol=pipe</CODE> to connect via a named pipe, or
<CODE>--protocol=memory</CODE> to connect via shared memory.  For TCP/IP
connections, you may also need to specify <CODE>--host</CODE> and <CODE>--port</CODE>
options.  For the other types of connections, you may need to specify
a <CODE>--socket</CODE> option to specify a socket or named pipe name, or a
<CODE>--shared-memory-base-name</CODE> option to specify the shared memory name.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX453"></A>
<A NAME="IDX454"></A>
<A NAME="IDX455"></A>
<A NAME="IDX456"></A>
On Unix,
set the <CODE>MYSQL_UNIX_PORT</CODE> and <CODE>MYSQL_TCP_PORT</CODE> environment variables
to point to the Unix socket and TCP/IP port before you start your clients.
If you normally use a specific socket or port, you can place commands
to set these environment variables in your <TT>`.login'</TT> file so that they
apply each time you log in.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX457"></A>
<A NAME="IDX458"></A>
Specify the default socket and TCP/IP port in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> group of
an option file. Foe example, you can use <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> on Windows, or
the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your home directory on Unix. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<LI>

In a C program, you can specify the port or socket arguments in the
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> call.  You can also have the program read
option files by calling <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_functions">11.1.3  C API Function Descriptions</A>.

<LI>

If you are using the Perl <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> module, you can read the options
from the MySQL option files. For example:


<PRE>
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=client;"
        . "mysql_read_default_file=/usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect($dsn, $user, $password);

MySQL has an advanced but non-standard security/privilege
system.  This section describes how it works.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="General_security" HREF="manual_toc.html#General_security">4.2.1  General Security Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
Anyone using MySQL on a computer connected to the Internet
should read this section to avoid the most common security mistakes.

</P>
<P>
In discussing security, we emphasise the necessity of fully protecting the
entire server host (not simply the MySQL server) against all types
of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, altering, playback, and denial of
service. We do not cover all aspects of availability and fault tolerance
here.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all
connections, queries, and other operations that a user may attempt to
perform. There is also some support for SSL-encrypted connections
between MySQL clients and servers. Many of the concepts
discussed here are not specific to MySQL at all; the same
general ideas apply to almost all applications.

</P>
<P>
When running MySQL, follow these guidelines whenever possible:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<STRONG>Do not ever give anyone (except the mysql <CODE>root</CODE> user) access to the
<CODE>user</CODE> table in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database!</STRONG>  This is critical.
<STRONG>The encrypted password is the real password in MySQL.</STRONG>
Anyone who knows the password which is listed in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
and has access to the host listed for the account <STRONG>can easily log
in as that user</STRONG>.

<LI>

Learn the MySQL access privilege system. The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands are used for controlling access to MySQL. Do
not grant any more privileges than necessary. Never grant privileges to all
hosts.

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

Try <CODE>mysql -u root</CODE>. If you are able to connect successfully to the
server without being asked for a password, you have problems. Anyone
can connect to your MySQL server as the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user with full privileges!
Review the MySQL installation instructions, paying particular
attention to the item about setting a <CODE>root</CODE> password.
<LI>

Use the command <CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> and check to see who has access to
what. Remove those privileges that are not necessary using the <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>
command.
</UL>

<LI>

Do not keep any plain-text passwords in your database. When your
computer becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full list of
passwords and use them. Instead use <CODE>MD5()</CODE>, <CODE>SHA1()</CODE> or
another one-way hashing function.
<LI>

Do not choose passwords from dictionaries. There are special programs to
break them. Even passwords like ``xfish98'' are very bad.  Much better is
``duag98'' which contains the same word ``fish'' but typed one key to the
left on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Another method is to use ``Mhall'' which
is taken from the first characters of each word in the sentence ``Mary had
a little lamb.'' This is easy to remember and type, but difficult to guess
for someone who does not know it.
<LI>

Invest in a firewall. This protects you from at least 50% of all types of
exploits in any software. Put MySQL behind the firewall or in
a demilitarised zone (DMZ).

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

Try to scan your ports from the Internet using a tool such as
<CODE>nmap</CODE>. MySQL uses port 3306 by default. This port should
be inaccessible from untrusted hosts. Another simple way to check whether
or not your MySQL port is open is to try the following command
from some remote machine, where <CODE>server_host</CODE> is the hostname of
your MySQL server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; telnet server_host 3306
</PRE>

If you get a connection and some garbage characters, the port is
open, and should be closed on your firewall or router, unless you really
have a good reason to keep it open. If <CODE>telnet</CODE> just hangs or the
connection is refused, everything is OK; the port is blocked.
</UL>

<LI>

Do not trust any data entered by your users. They can try to trick your
code by entering special or escaped character sequences in web forms,
URLs, or whatever application you have built. Be sure that your
application remains secure if a user enters something like ``<CODE>; DROP
DATABASE mysql;</CODE>''. This is an extreme example, but large security leaks
and data loss may occur as a result of hackers using similar techniques,
if you do not prepare for them.

Also remember to check numeric data. A common mistake is to protect only
strings. Sometimes people think that if a database contains only publicly
available data that it need not be protected. This is incorrect. At least
denial-of-service type attacks can be performed on such
databases. The simplest way to protect from this type of attack is to use
apostrophes around the numeric constants: <CODE>SELECT * FROM table
WHERE ID='234'</CODE> rather than <CODE>SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234</CODE>.
MySQL automatically converts this string to a number and
strips all non-numeric symbols from it.

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

All web applications:

<UL>
<LI>

Try to enter <SAMP>`''</SAMP> and <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> in all your web forms. If you get any kind
of MySQL error, investigate the problem right away.
<LI>

Try to modify any dynamic URLs by adding <CODE>%22</CODE> (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>), <CODE>%23</CODE>
(<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>), and <CODE>%27</CODE> (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>) in the URL.
<LI>

Try to modify datatypes in dynamic URLs from numeric ones to character
ones containing characters from previous examples. Your application
should be safe against this and similar attacks.
<LI>

Try to enter characters, spaces, and special symbols instead of numbers in
numeric fields. Your application should remove them before passing them to
MySQL or your application should generate an error. Passing
unchecked values to MySQL is very dangerous!
<LI>

Check data sizes before passing them to MySQL.
<LI>

Consider having your application connect to the database using a
different user name than the one you use for administrative purposes. Do
not give your applications any more access privileges than they need.
</UL>

<LI>

Users of PHP:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>addslashes()</CODE> function.

As of PHP 4.0.3, a <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> function is available
that is based on the function of the same name in the MySQL C API.
</UL>

<LI>

Users of MySQL C API:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> API call.

</UL>

<LI>

Users of MySQL++:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>escape</CODE> and <CODE>quote</CODE> modifiers for query streams.

Users of Java JDBC:

<UL>
<LI>Use a <CODE>PreparedStatement</CODE> object and placeholders.

</UL>

</UL>

<LI>

Do not transmit plain (unencrypted) data over the Internet. These data are
accessible to everyone who has the time and ability to intercept it and use
it for their own purposes. Instead, use an encrypted protocol such as SSL or
SSH. MySQL supports internal SSL connections as of Version 4.0.0.
SSH port-forwarding can be used to create an encrypted (and compressed)
tunnel for the communication.
<LI>

Learn to use the <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> and <CODE>strings</CODE> utilities. For most cases,
you can check whether MySQL data streams are unencrypted
by issuing a command like the following:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings
</PRE>

(This works under Linux and should work with small modifications under
other systems.)  Warning: If you do not see data this doesn't always
actually mean that it is encrypted. If you need high security, you should
consult with a security expert.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Security" HREF="manual_toc.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX464"></A>
<A NAME="IDX465"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you connect to a MySQL server, you normally should use a
password.  The password is not transmitted in clear text over the
connection, however the encryption algorithm is not very strong, and
with some effort a clever attacker can crack the password if he is able
to sniff the traffic between the client and the server. If the
connection between the client and the server goes through an untrusted
network, you should use an SSH tunnel to encrypt the
communication.

</P>
<P>
All other information is transferred as text that can be read by anyone
who is able to watch the connection.  If you are concerned about this,
you can use the compressed protocol (in MySQL Version 3.22 and above)
to make things much harder.  To make things even more secure you should use
<CODE>ssh</CODE>.  You can find an <CODE>Open Source</CODE> <CODE>ssh</CODE> client at
<a HREF="http://www.openssh.org/">http://www.openssh.org/</a>, and a commercial <CODE>ssh</CODE> client at
<a HREF="http://www.ssh.com/">http://www.ssh.com/</a>.  With this, you can get an encrypted TCP/IP
connection between a MySQL server and a MySQL client.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL 4.0, you can also use internal OpenSSL support.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.10  Using Secure Connections</A>.

</P>
<P>
To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the
following suggestions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use passwords for all MySQL users. Remember that anyone can log in
as any other person as simply as <CODE>mysql -u other_user db_name</CODE> if
<CODE>other_user</CODE> has no password.  It is common behaviour with client/server
applications that the client may specify any user name.  You can change the
password of all users by editing the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script before
you run it, or only the password for the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user like
this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
    -&#62;             WHERE user='root';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<LI>

Don't run the MySQL daemon as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user.  This is
very dangerous, because any user with the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege will be able
to create files as <CODE>root</CODE> (for example, <CODE>~root/.bashrc</CODE>). To
prevent this, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will refuse to run as <CODE>root</CODE> unless it
is specified directly using a <CODE>--user=root</CODE> option.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be run as an ordinary unprivileged user instead.
You can also create a new Unix user <CODE>mysql</CODE> to make everything
even more secure.  If you run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as another Unix user,
you don't need to change the <CODE>root</CODE> user name in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table, because MySQL user names have nothing to do with Unix
user names.  To start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as another Unix user, add a <CODE>user</CODE>
line that specifies the user name to the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> option file or the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option file in the
server's data directory. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
user=mysql
</PRE>

This will cause the server to start as the designated user whether you
start it manually or by using <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> or <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>.
For more details, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A>.

<LI>

Don't support symlinks to tables (this can be disabled with the
<CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE> option). This is especially important if you run
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root as anyone that has write access to the mysqld data
directories could then delete any file in the system!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links_to_tables">5.6.1.2  Using Symbolic Links for Tables</A>.

<LI>

Check that the Unix user that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> runs as is the only user with
read/write privileges in the database directories.

<LI>

Don't give the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege to all users.  The output of
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> shows the text of the currently executing
queries, so any user who is allowed to execute that command might be able to
see if another user issues an <CODE>UPDATE user SET
password=PASSWORD('not_secure')</CODE> query.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> reserves an extra connection for users who have the
<CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege, so that a MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user can log
in and check things even if all normal connections are in use.

<LI>

Don't give the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege to all users.  Any user that has this
privilege can write a file anywhere in the filesystem with the privileges of
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon!  To make this a bit safer, all files generated with
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> are writeable by everyone, and you cannot
overwrite existing files.

<A NAME="IDX466"></A>

The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege may also be used to read any world readable
file that is accessible to the Unix user that the server runs as.  One can also
read any file to the current database (which the user need some privilege for).
This could be abused, for example, by using <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> to load
<TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> into a table, which can then be read with
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<LI>

If you don't trust your DNS, you should use IP numbers instead of
hostnames in the grant tables. In any case, you should be very careful
about creating grant table entries using hostname values that contain
wildcards!

<LI>

If you want to restrict the number of connections for a single user, you
can do this by setting the <CODE>max_user_connections</CODE> variable in
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Privileges_options" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privileges_options">4.2.3  Startup Options for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Concerning Security</A></H3>

<P>
The following <CODE>mysqld</CODE> options affect security:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--local-infile[=(0|1)]</CODE>
<DD>
If one uses <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE> then one can't use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL
INFILE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
With this option, the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command returns only those
databases for which the user has some kind of privilege.
From version 4.0.2 this option is deprecated and doesn't do anything
(the option is enabled by default) as we now have the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-user-create</CODE>
<DD>
If this is enabled, an user can't create new users with the <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
command, if the user doesn't have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege for the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table.  If you want to give a user access to just create
new users with those privileges that the user has right to grant, you should
give the user the following privilege:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT INSERT(user) ON mysql.user TO 'user'@'hostname';
</PRE>

This will ensure that the user can't change any privilege columns directly,
but has to use the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command to give privileges to other users.

<DT><CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
<DD>
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all. This
gives everyone <STRONG>full access</STRONG> to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>
<DD>
Hostnames are not resolved.  All <CODE>Host</CODE> column values in the grant
tables must be IP numbers or <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow TCP/IP connections over the network.  All connections to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> must be made via Unix sockets.
This option is unsuitable when using a MySQL version prior to 3.23.27 with
the MIT-pthreads package, because Unix sockets were not supported by
MIT-pthreads at that time.

<DT><CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command, unless the user has the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. From version 4.0.2 you should no longer
need this option, since access can now be granted specifically with the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege.

<H3><A NAME="LOAD_DATA_LOCAL" HREF="manual_toc.html#LOAD_DATA_LOCAL">4.2.4  Security issues with <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
In MySQL 3.23.49 and MySQL 4.0.2, we added some new options to deal with
possible security issues when it comes to <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There are two possible problems with supporting this command:

</P>
<P>
As the reading of the file is initiated from the server, one could
theoretically create a patched MySQL server that could read any file on
the client machine that the current user has read access to, when
the client issues a query against the table.

</P>
<P>
In a web environment where the clients are connecting from a web
server, a user could use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> to read any files
that the web server process has read access to (assuming a user could
run any command against the SQL server).

</P>
<P>
There are two separate fixes for this:

</P>
<P>
If you don't configure MySQL with <CODE>--enable-local-infile</CODE>, then
<CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> will be disabled by all clients, unless one
calls <CODE>mysql_options(... MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE, 0)</CODE> in the client.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_options">11.1.3.163  <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
For the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line client, <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> can be
enabled by specifying the option <CODE>--local-infile[=1]</CODE>, or disabled
with <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
By default, all MySQL clients and libraries are compiled with
<CODE>--enable-local-infile</CODE>, to be compatible with MySQL 3.23.48 and
before.

</P>
<P>
One can disable all <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> commands in the MySQL server
by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In the case that <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE> is disabled in the server or
the client, you will get the error message (1148):

<H3><A NAME="What_Privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#What_Privileges">4.2.5  What the Privilege System Does</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX467"></A>
<A NAME="IDX468"></A>
<A NAME="IDX469"></A>

</P>
<P>
The primary function of the MySQL privilege system is to
authenticate a user connecting from a given host, and to associate that user
with privileges on a database such as
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Additional functionality includes the ability to have an anonymous user and
to grant privileges for MySQL-specific functions such as <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> and administrative operations.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privileges">4.2.6  How the Privilege System Works</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX470"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL privilege system ensures that all users may do exactly the
things that they are supposed to be allowed to do.  When you connect to a
MySQL server, your identity is determined by <STRONG>the host from
which you connect</STRONG> and <STRONG>the user name you specify</STRONG>.  The system grants
privileges according to your identity and <STRONG>what you want to do</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL considers both your hostname and user name in identifying you
because there is little reason to assume that a given user name belongs to
the same person everywhere on the Internet.  For example, the user
<CODE>joe</CODE> who connects from <CODE>office.com</CODE> need not be the same
person as the user <CODE>joe</CODE> who connects from <CODE>elsewhere.com</CODE>.
MySQL handles this by allowing you to distinguish users on different
hosts that happen to have the same name:  you can grant <CODE>joe</CODE> one set
of privileges for connections from <CODE>office.com</CODE>, and a different set
of privileges for connections from <CODE>elsewhere.com</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL access control involves two stages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Stage 1: The server checks whether you are even allowed to connect.

<LI>

Stage 2: Assuming you can connect, the server checks each request you issue
to see whether you have sufficient privileges to perform it.  For
example, if you try to select rows from a table in a database or drop a table
from the database, the server makes sure you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
privilege for the table or the <CODE>DROP</CODE> privilege for the database.
</UL>

<P>
Note that if your privileges are changed (either by yourself or someone else)
while you are connected, those changes will not necessarily take
effect with your next query or queries. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A> for
details.

</P>
<P>
The server uses the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, and <CODE>host</CODE> tables in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database at both stages of access control.  The fields in these
grant tables are shown here:

</P>

<P>
Each grant table contains scope fields and privilege fields.

</P>
<P>
Scope fields determine the scope of each entry in the tables, that is, the
context in which the entry applies.  For example, a <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
with <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE> values of <CODE>'thomas.loc.gov'</CODE> and
<CODE>'bob'</CODE> would be used for authenticating connections made to the server
by <CODE>bob</CODE> from the host <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE>.  Similarly, a <CODE>db</CODE>
table entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Db</CODE> fields of
<CODE>'thomas.loc.gov'</CODE>, <CODE>'bob'</CODE> and <CODE>'reports'</CODE> would be used when
<CODE>bob</CODE> connects from the host <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> to access the
<CODE>reports</CODE> database.  The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>
tables contain scope fields indicating tables or table/column combinations
to which each entry applies.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX471"></A>
For access-checking purposes, comparisons of <CODE>Host</CODE> values are
case-insensitive.  <CODE>User</CODE>, <CODE>Password</CODE>, <CODE>Db</CODE>, and
<CODE>Table_name</CODE> values are case-sensitive.
<CODE>Column_name</CODE> values are case-insensitive in MySQL Version
3.22.12 or later.

</P>
<P>
Privilege fields indicate the privileges granted by a table entry, that is,
what operations can be performed.  The server combines the information in the
various grant tables to form a complete description of a user's privileges.
The rules used to do this are described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>.

</P>
<P>
Scope fields are strings, declared as shown here; the default value for
each is the empty string:

<P>
Briefly, the server uses the grant tables like this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields determine whether to allow or reject
incoming connections.  For allowed connections, any privileges granted in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table indicate the user's global (superuser) privileges.
These privileges apply to <STRONG>all</STRONG> databases on the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables are used together:


<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>db</CODE> table scope fields determine which users can access which
databases from which hosts.  The privilege fields determine which operations
are allowed.

<LI>

The <CODE>host</CODE> table is used as an extension of the <CODE>db</CODE> table when you
want a given <CODE>db</CODE> table entry to apply to several hosts.  For example,
if you want a user to be able to use a database from several hosts in
your network, leave the <CODE>Host</CODE> value empty in the user's <CODE>db</CODE> table
entry, then populate the <CODE>host</CODE> table with an entry for each of those
hosts.  This mechanism is described more detail in section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>.
</UL>

<LI>

The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables are similar to
the <CODE>db</CODE> table, but are more fine-grained: they apply at the
table and column levels rather than at the database level.
</UL>

<P>
Note that administrative privileges (<CODE>RELOAD</CODE>, <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE>,
etc.) are specified only in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  This is because
administrative operations are operations on the server itself and are not
database-specific, so there is no reason to list such privileges in the
other grant tables.  In fact, only the <CODE>user</CODE> table need
be consulted to determine whether you can perform an administrative
operation.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege is specified only in the <CODE>user</CODE> table, too.
It is not an administrative privilege as such, but your ability to read or
write files on the server host is independent of the database you are
accessing.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server reads the contents of the grant tables once, when it
starts up.  Changes to the grant tables take effect as indicated in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you modify the contents of the grant tables, it is a good idea to make
sure that your changes set up privileges the way you want.  For help in
diagnosing problems, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Access_denied">4.2.13  Causes of <CODE>Access denied</CODE> Errors</A>.  For advice on security issues,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A>.

</P>
<P>
A useful
diagnostic tool is the <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> script, which Yves Carlier has
provided for the MySQL distribution.  Invoke <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> with
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option to find out how it works.
Note that <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> checks access using only the <CODE>user</CODE>,
<CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables.  It does not check table- or column-level
privileges.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX472"></A>

</P>
<P>
Information about user privileges is stored in the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database (that is, in the database named <CODE>mysql</CODE>).  The

and under the circumstances indicated in section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
The names used in this manual to refer to the privileges provided by
MySQL version 4.0.2 are shown here, along with the table column name
associated with each privilege in the grant tables and the context in
which the privilege applies. Further information about the meaning of
each privilege may be found at section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<P>
The <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
privileges allow you to perform operations on rows in existing tables in
a database.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements require the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege only if they
actually retrieve rows from a table.  You can execute certain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements even without permission to access any of the databases on the
server.  For example, you could use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client as a simple
calculator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;
mysql&#62; SELECT PI()*2;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>INDEX</CODE> privilege allows you to create or drop (remove) indexes.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privilege allows you to use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>CREATE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP</CODE> privileges allow you to create new
databases and tables, or to drop (remove) existing databases and tables.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you grant the <CODE>DROP</CODE> privilege for the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database to a user, that user can drop the database in which the
MySQL access privileges are stored!

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege allows you to give to other users those
privileges you yourself possess.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege gives you permission to read and write files on
the server using the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE</CODE> statements.  Any user to whom this privilege is granted can read
any world readable file accessable by the MySQL server and create a new
world readable file in any directory where the MySQL server can write.
The user can also read any file in the current database directory.
The user can however not change any existing file.

</P>
<P>
The remaining privileges are used for administrative operations, which are
performed using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> program.  The table here shows which
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> commands each administrative privilege allows you to
execute:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TABLE>

<P>
The <CODE>reload</CODE> command tells the server to re-read the grant tables.  The
<CODE>refresh</CODE> command flushes all tables and opens and closes the log
files.  <CODE>flush-privileges</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>reload</CODE>.  The other
<CODE>flush-*</CODE> commands perform functions similar to <CODE>refresh</CODE> but are
more limited in scope, and may be preferable in some instances.  For example,
if you want to flush just the log files, <CODE>flush-logs</CODE> is a better choice
than <CODE>refresh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>shutdown</CODE> command shuts down the server.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>processlist</CODE> command displays information about the threads
executing within the server.  The <CODE>kill</CODE> command kills server
threads.  You can always display or kill your own threads, but you need
the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege to display and <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege to
kill threads initiated by other users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#KILL">4.5.6  <CODE>KILL</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea in general to grant privileges only to those users who need
them, but you should exercise particular caution in granting certain
privileges:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege allows users to give away their privileges to
other users.  Two users with different privileges and with the <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
privilege are able to combine privileges.

<LI>

The <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privilege may be used to subvert the privilege system
by renaming tables.

<LI>

The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege can be abused to read any world-readable file
on the server or any file in the current database directory on the
server into a database table, the contents of which can then be accessed
using <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<LI>

The <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE> privilege can be abused to deny service to other
users entirely, by terminating the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege can be used to view the plain text of
currently executing queries, including queries that set or change passwords.

<LI>

Privileges on the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can be used to change passwords
and other access privilege information.  (Passwords are stored
encrypted, so a malicious user cannot simply read them to know the plain
text password.)  If they can access the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> password
column, they can use it to log into the MySQL server
for the given user.  (With sufficient privileges, the same user can
replace a password with a different one.)
</UL>

<P>
There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL
privilege system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied access.
That is, you cannot explicitly match a user and then refuse the connection.

<LI>

You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop tables
in a database but not to create or drop the database itself.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL client programs generally require that you specify connection
parameters when you want to access a MySQL server: the host you want
to connect to, your user name, and your password.  For example, the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client can be started like this (optional arguments are enclosed
between <SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql [-h host_name] [-u user_name] [-pyour_pass]
</PRE>

<P>
Alternate forms of the <CODE>-h</CODE>, <CODE>-u</CODE>, and <CODE>-p</CODE> options are
<CODE>--host=host_name</CODE>, <CODE>--user=user_name</CODE>, and
<CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE>.  Note that there is <EM>no space</EM> between
<CODE>-p</CODE> or <CODE>--password=</CODE> and the password following it.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: Specifying a password on the command-line is not secure!
Any user on your system may then find out your password by typing a command
like: <CODE>ps auxww</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql</CODE> uses default values for connection parameters that are missing
from the command-line:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The default hostname is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<LI>

The default user name is your Unix login name.

<LI>

No password is supplied if <CODE>-p</CODE> is missing.
</UL>

<P>
Thus, for a Unix user <CODE>joe</CODE>, the following commands are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h localhost -u joe
shell&#62; mysql -h localhost
shell&#62; mysql -u joe
shell&#62; mysql
</PRE>

<P>
Other MySQL clients behave similarly.

</P>
<P>
On Unix systems, you can specify different default values to be used when you
make a connection, so that you need not enter them on the command-line each
time you invoke a client program.  This can be done in a couple of ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX477"></A>
You can specify connection parameters in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> section of the
<TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> configuration file in your home directory.  The relevant
section of the file might look like this:


<PRE>
[client]
host=host_name
user=user_name
password=your_pass
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX480"></A>
<A NAME="IDX481"></A>
<A NAME="IDX482"></A>
<A NAME="IDX483"></A>
You can specify connection parameters using environment variables.  The
host can be specified for <CODE>mysql</CODE> using <CODE>MYSQL_HOST</CODE>.  The
MySQL user name can be specified using <CODE>USER</CODE> (this is for
Windows only).  The password can be specified using <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE>
(but this is insecure; see the next section).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts or
rejects the connection based on your identity and whether you can
verify your identity by supplying the correct password.  If not, the server
denies access to you completely.  Otherwise, the server accepts the
connection, then enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.

</P>
<P>
Your identity is based on two pieces of information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The host from which you connect

<LI>

Your MySQL user name
</UL>

<P>
Identity checking is performed using the three <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields
(<CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Password</CODE>).  The server accepts the
connection only if a <CODE>user</CODE> table entry matches your hostname and user
name, and you supply the correct password.

</P>
<P>
Values in the <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields may be specified as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <CODE>Host</CODE> value may be a hostname or an IP number, or <CODE>'localhost'</CODE>
to indicate the local host.

You can use the wildcard characters <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> in the <CODE>Host</CODE>
field.

<LI>

A <CODE>Host</CODE> value of <CODE>'%'</CODE> matches any hostname.

<LI>

A blank <CODE>Host</CODE> value means that the privilege should be anded
with the entry in the <CODE>host</CODE> table that matches the given host name.
You can find more information about this in the next chapter.

<LI>

As of MySQL Version 3.23, for <CODE>Host</CODE> values specified as
IP numbers, you can specify a netmask indicating how many address bits to
use for the network number. For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.*
    -&#62; TO david@'192.58.197.0/255.255.255.0';
</PRE>

This will allow everyone to connect from an IP where the following is true:


<PRE>
user_ip &#38; netmask = host_ip.
</PRE>

In the above example all IP:s in the interval 192.58.197.0 -
192.58.197.255 can connect to the MySQL server.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX490"></A>
Wildcard characters are not allowed in the <CODE>User</CODE> field, but you can
specify a blank value, which matches any name.  If the <CODE>user</CODE> table
entry that matches an incoming connection has a blank user name, the user is
considered to be the anonymous user (the user with no name), rather than the
name that the client actually specified.  This means that a blank user name
is used for all further access checking for the duration of the connection
(that is, during Stage 2).

<LI>

The <CODE>Password</CODE> field can be blank.  This does not mean that any password
matches, it means the user must connect without specifying a password.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
Non-blank <CODE>Password</CODE> values represent encrypted passwords.
MySQL does not store passwords in plaintext form for anyone to
see.  Rather, the password supplied by a user who is attempting to
connect is encrypted (using the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function). The
encrypted password is then used when the client/server is checking if
the password is correct. (This is done without the encrypted password
ever traveling over the connection.)  Note that from MySQL's
point of view the encrypted password is the REAL password, so you should
not give anyone access to it!  In particular, don't give normal users
read access to the tables in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database!
From version 4.1, MySQL employs a different password and login mechanism
that is secure even if TCP/IP packets are sniffed and/or the mysql database
is captured.

The examples here show how various combinations of <CODE>Host</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE> values in <CODE>user</CODE> table entries apply to incoming
connections:

<P>
Because you can use IP wildcard values in the <CODE>Host</CODE> field (for example,
<CODE>'144.155.166.%'</CODE> to match every host on a subnet), there is the
possibility that someone might try to exploit this capability by naming a
host <CODE>144.155.166.somewhere.com</CODE>.  To foil such attempts, MySQL
disallows matching on hostnames that start with digits and a dot. Thus, if
you have a host named something like <CODE>1.2.foo.com</CODE>, its name will never
match the <CODE>Host</CODE> column of the grant tables.  Only an IP number can
match an IP wildcard value.

</P>
<P>
An incoming connection may be matched by more than one entry in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table.  For example, a connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>fred</CODE> would be matched by several of the entries shown in the preceding
table.  How
does the server choose which entry to use if more than one matches?  The
server resolves this question by sorting the <CODE>user</CODE> table after reading
it at startup time, then looking through the entries in sorted order when a
user attempts to connect.  The first matching entry is the one that is used.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>user</CODE> table sorting works as follows.  Suppose the <CODE>user</CODE> table
looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| %         | root     | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
+-----------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
When the server reads in the table, it orders the entries with the
most-specific <CODE>Host</CODE> values first (<CODE>'%'</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column
means ``any host'' and is least specific).  Entries with the same <CODE>Host</CODE>
value are ordered with the most-specific <CODE>User</CODE> values first (a blank
<CODE>User</CODE> value means ``any user'' and is least specific).  The resulting
sorted <CODE>user</CODE> table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| %         | root     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
<A NAME="IDX493"></A>
<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
When a connection is attempted, the server looks through the sorted entries
and uses the first match found.  For a connection from <CODE>localhost</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE>, the entries with <CODE>'localhost'</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column
match first.  Of those, the entry with the blank user name matches both the
connecting hostname and user name.  (The <CODE>'%'/'jeffrey'</CODE> entry would
have matched, too, but it is not the first match in the table.)

</P>
<P>
Here is another example.  Suppose the <CODE>user</CODE> table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
| thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
+----------------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
The sorted table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
+----------------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
A connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by <CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is matched by the
first entry, whereas a connection from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is matched by the second.

</P>
<P>
A common misconception is to think that for a given user name, all entries
that explicitly name that user will be used first when the server attempts to
find a match for the connection.  This is simply not true.  The previous
example illustrates this, where a connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is first matched not by the entry containing <CODE>'jeffrey'</CODE>
as the <CODE>User</CODE> field value, but by the entry with no user name!

</P>
<P>
If you have problems connecting to the server, print out the <CODE>user</CODE>
table and sort it by hand to see where the first match is being made.
If connection was successful, but your privileges are not what you
expected you may use <CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE> function (new in version
4.0.6) to see what user/host combination your connection actually
matched. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Request_access" HREF="manual_toc.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A></H3>

<P>
Once you establish a connection, the server enters Stage 2.  For each request
that comes in on the connection, the server checks whether you have
sufficient privileges to perform it, based on the type of operation you wish
to perform.  This is where the privilege fields in the grant tables come into
play.  These privileges can come from any of the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, or <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables.  The grant
tables are manipulated with <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  (You may find it helpful to refer to
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges">4.2.6  How the Privilege System Works</A>, which lists the fields present in each of the grant
tables.)

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>user</CODE> table grants privileges that are assigned to you on a global
basis and that apply no matter what the current database is.  For example, if
the <CODE>user</CODE> table grants you the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> privilege, you can
delete rows from any database on the server host!  In other words,
<CODE>user</CODE> table privileges are superuser privileges.  It is wise to grant
privileges in the <CODE>user</CODE> table only to superusers such as server or
database administrators.  For other users, you should leave the privileges
in the <CODE>user</CODE> table set to <CODE>'N'</CODE> and grant privileges on a
database-specific basis only, using the <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables.

<UL>
<LI>

The wildcard characters <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> can be used in the <CODE>Host</CODE>

A <CODE>'%'</CODE> <CODE>Host</CODE> value in the <CODE>db</CODE> table means ``any host.'' A

The <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables are read in and sorted when the server

fields, and the <CODE>host</CODE> table is sorted on the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>Db</CODE>
scope fields.  As with the <CODE>user</CODE> table, sorting puts the most-specific
values first and least-specific values last, and when the server looks for
matching entries, it uses the first match that it finds.

The request verification process is described here.  (If you are familiar

</P>
<P>
For administrative requests (<CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE>, <CODE>RELOAD</CODE>, etc.), the
server checks only the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry, because that is the only table
that specifies administrative privileges.  Access is granted if the entry
allows the requested operation and denied otherwise.  For example, if you
want to execute <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> but your <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
doesn't grant the <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE> privilege to you, access is denied
without even checking the <CODE>db</CODE> or <CODE>host</CODE> tables.  (They
contain no <CODE>Shutdown_priv</CODE> column, so there is no need to do so.)

</P>
<P>
For database-related requests (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, etc.), the
server first checks the user's global (superuser) privileges by looking in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry.  If the entry allows the requested operation,
access is granted.  If the global privileges in the <CODE>user</CODE> table are
insufficient, the server determines the user's database-specific privileges
by checking the <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The server looks in the <CODE>db</CODE> table for a match on the <CODE>Host</CODE>,
<CODE>Db</CODE>, and <CODE>User</CODE> fields.  The <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE> fields are
matched to the connecting user's hostname and MySQL user name.  The
<CODE>Db</CODE> field is matched to the database the user wants to access.  If
there is no entry for the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>, access is denied.

<LI>

If there is a matching <CODE>db</CODE> table entry and its <CODE>Host</CODE> field is
not blank, that entry defines the user's database-specific privileges.

<LI>

If the matching <CODE>db</CODE> table entry's <CODE>Host</CODE> field is blank, it
signifies that the <CODE>host</CODE> table enumerates which hosts should be allowed
access to the database.  In this case, a further lookup is done in the
<CODE>host</CODE> table to find a match on the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>Db</CODE> fields.
If no <CODE>host</CODE> table entry matches, access is denied.  If there is a
match, the user's database-specific privileges are computed as the
intersection (<STRONG>not</STRONG> the union!) of the privileges in the <CODE>db</CODE> and
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries, that is, the privileges that are <CODE>'Y'</CODE> in both
entries.  (This way you can grant general privileges in the <CODE>db</CODE> table
entry and then selectively restrict them on a host-by-host basis using the
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries.)
</OL>

<P>
After determining the database-specific privileges granted by the <CODE>db</CODE>
and <CODE>host</CODE> table entries, the server adds them to the global privileges
granted by the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  If the result allows the requested
operation, access is granted.  Otherwise, the server checks the user's
table and column privileges in the <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>
tables and adds those to the user's privileges.  Access is allowed or denied
based on the result.

</P>
<P>
Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding description of how a user's
privileges are calculated may be summarised like this:

</P>

<PRE>
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
</PRE>

<P>
It may not be apparent why, if the global <CODE>user</CODE> entry privileges are
initially found to be insufficient for the requested operation, the server
adds those privileges to the database-, table-, and column-specific privileges
later. The reason is that a request might require more than one type of
privilege.  For example, if you execute an <CODE>INSERT ...  SELECT</CODE>
statement, you need both <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privileges.
Your privileges might be such that the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry grants one
privilege and the <CODE>db</CODE> table entry grants the other.  In this case, you
have the necessary privileges to perform the request, but the server cannot
tell that from either table by itself; the privileges granted by the entries
in both tables must be combined.

<H3><A NAME="Password_hashing" HREF="manual_toc.html#Password_hashing">4.2.11  Password Hashing in MySQL 4.1</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL user accounts are listed in the <CODE>user</CODE> table of the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database. Each MySQL account is assigned a password, although
what is stored in the <CODE>Password</CODE> column of the <CODE>user</CODE> table is not the
plaintext version of the password, but a hash value computed from
it.  Password hash values are computed by the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses passwords in two phases of client/server communication:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

First, when a client attempts to connect to the server, there is an
initial authentication step in which the client must present a password
that matches the hash value stored in the user table for the account
that the client wants to use.

<LI>

Second, after the client connects, it may set or change the password
hashes for accounts listed in the user table (if it has sufficient
privileges). The client may do this by using the PASSWORD() function to
generate a password hash, or by using the GRANT or SET PASSWORD
statements.

</UL>

<P>
In other words, the server <EM>uses</EM> hash values during authentication when
a client first attempts to connect. The server <EM>generates</EM> hash values
if a connected client invokes the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function or uses a
<CODE>GRANT</CODE>
or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> statement to set or change a password.

</P>
<P>
The password hashing mechanism was updated in MySQL 4.1 to provide
better security and to reduce the risk of passwords being stolen.
However, this new mechanism is understood only by the 4.1 server and
4.1 clients, which can result in some compatibility problems.
A 4.1 client can connect to a pre-4.1 server, because the client
understands both the old and new password hashing mechanisms. However,
a pre-4.1 client that attempts to connect to a 4.1 server may run into
difficulties.  For example, a 4.0 <CODE>mysql</CODE> client that attempts to connect
to a 4.1 server may fail with the following error message:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql
Client does not support authentication protocol requested
by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
</PRE>

<P>
The following discussion describes the differences between the old and
new password mechanisms, and what you should do if you upgrade your
server to 4.1 but need to maintain backward compatibility with pre-4.1
clients.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This discussion contrasts 4.1 behaviour with pre-4.1 behaviour,
but the 4.1 behaviour described here actually begins with 4.1.1. MySQL
4.1.0 is an ``odd'' release because it has a slightly different mechanism
than that implemented in 4.1.1 and up.  Differences between 4.1.0 and
more recent versions are described later.

</P>
<P>
Prior to MySQL 4.1, password hashes computed by the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function
are 16 bytes long.  Such hashes look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT PASSWORD('mypass');
+--------------------+
| PASSWORD('mypass') |
+--------------------+
| 6f8c114b58f2ce9e   |
+--------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>Password</CODE> column of the <CODE>user</CODE> table (in which these hashes are stored)
also is 16 bytes long before MySQL 4.1.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.1, the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function has been modified to produce
a longer 41-byte hash value:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT PASSWORD('mypass');
+-----------------------------------------------+
| PASSWORD('mypass')                            |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| *43c8aa34cdc98eddd3de1fe9a9c2c2a9f92bb2098d75 |
+-----------------------------------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Accordingly, the <CODE>Password</CODE> column in the <CODE>user</CODE> table also must be 41
bytes long to store these values:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you perform a new installation of MySQL 4.1, the <CODE>Password</CODE> column
will be made 41 bytes long automatically.

<LI>

If you upgrade an older installation to 4.1, you should run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script to update the length of the
<CODE>Password</CODE>
column from 16 to 41 bytes. (The script does not change existing
password values, which remain 16 bytes long.)

</UL>

<P>
A widened <CODE>Password</CODE> column can store password hashes in both the old and
new formats. The format of any given password hash value can be
determined two ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The obvious difference is the length (16 bytes versus 41 bytes)

<LI>

A second difference is that password hashes in the new format always
begin with a <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> character, whereas passwords in the old format never do

</UL>

<P>
The longer password hash format has better cryptographic properties, and
client authentication based on long hashes is more secure than that
based on the older short hashes.

</P>
<P>
The differences between short and long password hashes are relevant
both for how the server uses passwords during authentication and for
how it generates password hashes for connected clients that perform
password-changing operations.

</P>
<P>
The way in which the server uses password hashes during authentication
is affected by the width of the Password column:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

If the column is narrow, only short-hash authentication is used.

<LI>

If the column is wide, it can hold either short or long hashes, and
the server can use either format:


<UL>

<LI>

Pre-4.1 clients can connect, though because they know only about
the old hashing mechanism, they can authenticate only for accounts that
have short hashes.

<LI>

4.1 clients can authenticate for accounts that have short or long hashes.

</UL>

</UL>

<P>
For short-hash accounts, the authentication process is actually a bit
more secure for 4.1 clients than for older clients.  In terms of security,
the gradient from least to most secure is:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Pre-4.1 client authenticating for account with short password hash

<LI>

4.1 client authenticating for account with short password hash

<LI>

4.1 client authenticating for account with long password hash

</UL>

<P>
The way in which the server generates password hashes for connected
clients is affected by the width of the <CODE>Password</CODE> column and by the
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option.  A 4.1 server generates long hashes only if certain
conditions are met:
The <CODE>Password</CODE> column must be wide enough to hold long
values and the <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option must not be given.
These conditions apply as follows:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The <CODE>Password</CODE> column must be wide enough to hold long hashes (41 bytes).
If the column has not been updated and still has the pre-4.1 width
(16 bytes), the server notices that long hashes cannot fit into it and
generates only short hashes when a client performs password-changing
operations using <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, <CODE>GRANT</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE>.
(This behaviour
occurs if you have upgraded to 4.1 but have not run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script to widen the <CODE>Password</CODE> column.)

<LI>

If the <CODE>Password</CODE> column is wide, it can store either short or long
password hashes. In this case, <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, <CODE>GRANT</CODE>, and <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE>
will generate long hashes unless the server was started with the
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option. This option forces the server to generate
short passsword hashes instead.

</UL>

<P>
The purpose of the <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option is to allow you to maintain
backward compatibility with pre-4.1 clients under circumstances where
the server would otherwise generate long password hashes. It doesn't
affect authentication (4.1 clients can still use accounts that have
long password hashes), but it does prevent creation of a long
password hash in the <CODE>user</CODE> table as the result of a password-changing
operation. Were that to occur, the account no longer could be used
by pre-4.1 clients. Without the <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option, the following
scenario is possible:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

An old client connects to an account that has a short password hash.

<LI>

The client changes the account's password. Without <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE>,
this results in the account having a long password hash.

<LI>

The next time the old client attempts to connect to the account, it
cannot, because the account now requires the new hashing mechanism
during authentication. (Once an account has a long password hash in
the user table, only 4.1 clients can authenticate for it, because
pre-4.1 clients do not understand long hashes.)

</UL>

<P>
This scenario illustrates that it is dangerous to run a 4.1 server
without using the <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option if you must support older pre-4.1
clients. By running the server with <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE>, password-changing
operations will not generate long password hashes and thus do not cause
accounts to become inaccessible to older clients. (Those clients cannot
inadvertently lock themselves out by changing their password and ending
up with a long password hash.)

</P>
<P>
The downside of the <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option is that any passwords you
create or change will use short hashes, even for 4.1 clients. Thus, you
lose the additional security provided by long password hashes. If you want
to create an account that has a long hash (for example, for use by 4.1
clients), you must do so while running the server without
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The following scenarios are possible for running a 4.1 server:

</P>
<P>
Scenario 1) Narrow <CODE>Password</CODE> column in user table

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Only short hashes can be stored in the <CODE>Password</CODE> column.

<LI>

The server uses only short hashes during client authentication.

<LI>

For connected clients, password hash-generating operations
involving <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, <CODE>GRANT</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> use short hashes
exclusively.  Any change to an account's password results in
that account having a short password hash.

<LI>

The <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option can be used but is superfluous because
with a narrow <CODE>Password</CODE> column, the server will be generating short
password hashes anyway.

</UL>

<P>
Scenario 2) Long <CODE>Password</CODE> column; server not started with
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Short or long hashes can be stored in the <CODE>Password</CODE> column.

<LI>

4.1 clients can authenticate for accounts that have short or long
hashes.

<LI>

Pre-4.1 clients can authenticate only for accounts that have short
hashes.

<LI>

For connected clients, password hash-generating operations
involving <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, <CODE>GRANT</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> use long hashes
exclusively.  Any change to an account's password results in that
account having a long password hash.

<LI>

<CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE> may be used to explicitly generate a short hash. For
example, to assign an account a short password, use <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> as follows:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password = OLD_PASSWORD('mypass')
    -&#62; WHERE Host = 'some_host' AND User = 'some_user';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
As indicated earlier, a danger in this scenario is that it is
possible for accounts that have a short password hash to become
inaccessible to pre-4.1 clients. Any change to such an account's
password made via <CODE>GRANT</CODE>, <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE>, or <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> results in
the account being given a long password hash, and from that point
on, no pre-4.1 client can authenticate to that account until the
client upgrades to 4.1.

</P>
<P>
Scenario 3) Long <CODE>Password</CODE> column; server started with
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> option

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Short or long hashes can be stored in the <CODE>Password</CODE> column.

<LI>

4.1 clients can authenticate for accounts that have short or long
hashes (but note that it is possible to create long hashes only when
the server is started without <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE>).

<LI>

Pre-4.1 clients can authenticate only for accounts that have short
hashes.

<LI>

For connected clients, password hash-generating operations
involving <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, <CODE>GRANT</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> use short hashes
exclusively.  Any change to an account's password results in that
account having a short password hash.

</UL>

<P>
In this scenario, you cannot create accounts that have long password
hashes, because <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> prevents generation of long hashes.  Also,
if you create an account with a long hash before using the
<CODE>--old-passwords</CODE>
option, changing the account's password while <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> is in
effect results in the account being given a short password, causing it
to lose the security benefits of a longer hash.

</P>
<P>
The disadvantages for these scenarios may be summarized as follows:

</P>
<P>
Scenario 1) You cannot take advantage of longer hashes that provide more
secure authentication.

</P>
<P>
Scenario 2) Accounts with short hashes become inaccessible to pre-4.1
clients if you change their passwords without explicitly using
<CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Scenario 3) <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> prevents accounts with short hashes from
becoming inaccessible, but password-changing operations cause accounts
with long hashes to revert to short hashes, and you cannot change them
back to long hashes while <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE> is in effect.

</P>


<H3>4.2.12  Implications of Password Hashing Changes for Application Programs</H3>

<P>
An upgrade to MySQL 4.1 can cause a compatibility issue for
applications that use <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> to generate passwords for their own
purposes. (Applications really should not do this, because <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>
should be used only to manage passwords for MySQL accounts. But some
applications use <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> for their own purposes anyway.)  If you upgrade to
4.1 and run the server under conditions where it generates long password
hashes, an application that uses <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> for its own passwords will
break.  The recommended course of action is to modify the application to
use another function such as <CODE>SHA1()</CODE> or <CODE>MD5()</CODE> to produce hashed values.
If that is not possible, you can use the <CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE> function, which
is provided to generate short hashes in the old format. (But note that
<CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE> may one day no longer be supported.)

</P>
<P>
If the server is running under circumstances where it generates short hashes,
<CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE> is available but is equivalent to <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Password hashing in MySQL 4.1.0 differs from hashing in 4.1.1 and up.
The 4.1.0 differences are:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Password hashes are 45 bytes long rather than 41 bytes.

<LI>

The <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function is non-repeatable.  That is, with a given
argument <CODE>X</CODE>, successive calls to <CODE>PASSWORD(X)</CODE> generate different
results.

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Access_denied" HREF="manual_toc.html#Access_denied">4.2.13  Causes of <CODE>Access denied</CODE> Errors</A></H3>

<P>
If you encounter <CODE>Access denied</CODE> errors when you try to connect to the
MySQL server, the following list indicates some courses of
action you can take to correct the problem:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

After installing MySQL, did you run the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
script to set up the initial grant table contents?  If not, do so.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.  Test the initial privileges by executing
this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root test
</PRE>

The server should let you connect without error.  You should also make sure
you have a file <TT>`user.MYD'</TT> in the MySQL database directory.
Ordinarily, this is <TT>`PATH/var/mysql/user.MYD'</TT>, where <CODE>PATH</CODE> is the
pathname to the MySQL installation root.

<LI>

After a fresh installation, you should connect to the server and set up
your users and their access permissions:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
</PRE>

The server should let you connect because the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user
has no password initially.  That is also a security risk, so setting the
<CODE>root</CODE> password is something you should do while you're setting up
your other MySQL users.

If you try to connect as <CODE>root</CODE> and get this error:


<PRE>
Access denied for user: '@unknown' to database mysql
</PRE>

this means that you don't have an entry in the <CODE>user</CODE> table with a
<CODE>User</CODE> column value of <CODE>'root'</CODE> and that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> cannot
resolve the hostname for your client.  In this case, you must restart the
server with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option and edit your
<TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> or <TT>`\windows\hosts'</TT> file to add an entry for your
host.

<LI>

If you get an error like the following:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx ver
Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: YES)
</PRE>

It means that you are using an incorrect password. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Passwords">4.3.8  Setting Up Passwords</A>.

If you have forgot the root password, you can restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> to change the password.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Resetting_permissions">A.4.2  How to Reset a Forgotten Root Password</A>.

If you get the above error even if you haven't specified a password,
this means that you have an incorrect password in some <CODE>my.ini</CODE>
file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  You can avoid using option files with the <CODE>--no-defaults</CODE> option, as follows:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root ver
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX510"></A>
If you updated an existing MySQL installation from a version earlier
than Version 3.22.11 to Version 3.22.11 or later, did you run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script?  If not, do so.  The structure of
the grant tables changed with MySQL Version 3.22.11 when the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement became functional.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

<LI>

If your privileges seem to have changed in the middle of a session, it may be
that a superuser has changed them.  Reloading the grant tables affects new
client connections, but it also affects existing connections as indicated in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

<LI>

If you can't get your password to work, remember that you must use
the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function if you set the password with the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> statements.  The
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function is unnecessary if you specify the password using
the <CODE>GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> statement or the <CODE>mysqladmin
password</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Passwords">4.3.8  Setting Up Passwords</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>localhost</CODE> is a synonym for your local hostname, and is also the
default host to which clients try to connect if you specify no host
explicitly.  However, connections to <CODE>localhost</CODE> do not work if you are
using a MySQL version prior to 3.23.27 that uses MIT-pthreads
(<CODE>localhost</CODE> connections are made using Unix sockets, which were not
supported by MIT-pthreads at that time).  To avoid this problem on such
systems, you should use the <CODE>--host</CODE> option to name
the server host explicitly.  This will make a TCP/IP connection to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.  In this case, you must have your real hostname in
<CODE>user</CODE> table entries on the server host.  (This is true even if you are
running a client program on the same host as the server.)

<LI>

If you get an <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error when trying to connect to the
database with <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE>, you may have a problem
with the <CODE>user</CODE> table. Check this by executing <CODE>mysql -u root
mysql</CODE> and issuing this SQL statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM user;
</PRE>

The result should include an entry with the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>
columns matching your computer's hostname and your MySQL user name.

<LI>

The <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error message will tell you who you are trying
to log in as, the host from which you are trying to connect, and whether
or not you were using a password. Normally, you should have one entry in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table that exactly matches the hostname and user name
that were given in the error message. For example if you get an error
message that contains <CODE>Using password: NO</CODE>, this means that you
tried to login without an password.

<LI>

If you get the following error when you try to connect from a different host
than the one on which the MySQL server is running, then there is no
row in the <CODE>user</CODE> table that matches that host:


<PRE>
Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
</PRE>

You can fix this by using the command-line tool <CODE>mysql</CODE> (on the
server host!) to add a row to the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, or <CODE>host</CODE>
table for the user/hostname combination from which you are trying to
connect and then execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE>.  If you are
not running MySQL Version 3.22 and you don't know the IP number or
hostname of the machine from which you are connecting, you should put an
entry with <CODE>'%'</CODE> as the <CODE>Host</CODE> column value in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--log</CODE> option on the
server machine.  After trying to connect from the client machine, the
information in the MySQL log will indicate how you really did
connect.  (Then replace the <CODE>'%'</CODE> in the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
with the actual hostname that shows up in the log.  Otherwise, you'll
have a system that is insecure.)

Another reason for this error on Linux is that you are using a binary
MySQL version that is compiled with a different glibc version
than the one you are using.  In this case you should either upgrade your
OS/glibc or download the source MySQL version and compile this
yourself.  A source RPM is normally trivial to compile and install, so
this isn't a big problem.

<LI>

If you get an error message where the hostname is not shown or where the
hostname is an IP, even if you try to connect with a hostname:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx -h some-hostname ver
Access denied for user: 'root@' (Using password: YES)
</PRE>

This means that MySQL got some error when trying to resolve the
IP to a hostname.  In this case you can execute <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-hosts</CODE> to reset the internal DNS cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

Some permanent solutions are:


<UL>
<LI>

Try to find out what is wrong with your DNS server and fix this.

<LI>

Specify IPs instead of hostnames in the MySQL privilege tables.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>.

<LI>

Connect to <CODE>localhost</CODE> if you are running the server and the client
on the same machine.

<LI>

Put the client machine names in <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u root test</CODE> works but <CODE>mysql -h your_hostname -u root
test</CODE> results in <CODE>Access denied</CODE>, then you may not have the correct name
for your host in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  A common problem here is that the
<CODE>Host</CODE> value in the user table entry specifies an unqualified hostname,
but your system's name resolution routines return a fully qualified domain
name (or vice-versa).  For example, if you have an entry with host
<CODE>'tcx'</CODE> in the <CODE>user</CODE> table, but your DNS tells MySQL that
your hostname is <CODE>'tcx.subnet.se'</CODE>, the entry will not work. Try adding
an entry to the <CODE>user</CODE> table that contains the IP number of your host as
the <CODE>Host</CODE> column value.  (Alternatively, you could add an entry to the
<CODE>user</CODE> table with a <CODE>Host</CODE> value that contains a wildcard--for
example, <CODE>'tcx.%'</CODE>.  However, use of hostnames ending with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is
<STRONG>insecure</STRONG> and is <STRONG>not</STRONG> recommended!)

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u user_name test</CODE> works but <CODE>mysql -u user_name
other_db_name</CODE> doesn't work, you don't have an entry for <CODE>other_db_name</CODE>
listed in the <CODE>db</CODE> table.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE> works when executed on the server
machine, but <CODE>mysql -h host_name -u user_name db_name</CODE> doesn't work when
executed on another client machine, you don't have the client machine listed
in the <CODE>user</CODE> table or the <CODE>db</CODE> table.

<LI>

If you can't figure out why you get <CODE>Access denied</CODE>, remove from the
<CODE>user</CODE> table all entries that have <CODE>Host</CODE> values containing
wildcards (entries that contain <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>).  A very common error
is to insert a new entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'%'</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>'some user'</CODE>, thinking that this will allow you to specify
<CODE>localhost</CODE> to connect from the same machine.  The reason that this
doesn't work is that the default privileges include an entry with
<CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>''</CODE>.  Because that entry
has a <CODE>Host</CODE> value <CODE>'localhost'</CODE> that is more specific than
<CODE>'%'</CODE>, it is used in preference to the new entry when connecting from
<CODE>localhost</CODE>!  The correct procedure is to insert a second entry with
<CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>'some_user'</CODE>, or to
remove the entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>''</CODE>.

<LI>

If you get the following error, you may have a problem with the <CODE>db</CODE> or
<CODE>host</CODE> table:


<PRE>
Access to database denied
</PRE>

If the entry selected from the <CODE>db</CODE> table has an empty value in the
<CODE>Host</CODE> column, make sure there are one or more corresponding entries in
the <CODE>host</CODE> table specifying which hosts the <CODE>db</CODE> table entry
applies to.

If you get the error when using the SQL commands <CODE>SELECT ...
INTO OUTFILE</CODE> or <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, your entry in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
probably doesn't have the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege enabled.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX511"></A>
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
<A NAME="IDX513"></A>
Remember that client programs will use connection parameters specified
in configuration files or environment variables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.  If a client seems to be sending the wrong default
connection parameters when you don't specify them on the command-line,
check your environment and the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your home
directory.  You might also check the system-wide MySQL
configuration files, though it is far less likely that client connection
parameters will be specified there. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  If you get
<CODE>Access denied</CODE> when you run a client without any options, make
sure you haven't specified an old password in any of your option files!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<LI>

If you make changes to the grant tables directly (using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement) and your changes seem to be ignored, remember
that you must issue a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or execute a
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> command to cause the server to re-read
the privilege tables. Otherwise, your changes have no effect until the
next time the server is restarted.  Remember that after you set the
<CODE>root</CODE> password with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> command, you won't need to
specify it until after you flush the privileges, because the server
won't know you've changed the password yet!

<LI>

If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python, or ODBC program, try to
connect to the server with <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE> or <CODE>mysql
-u user_name -pyour_pass db_name</CODE>.  If you are able to connect using the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client, there is a problem with your program and not with the
access privileges.  (Note that there is no space between <CODE>-p</CODE> and the
password; you can also use the <CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE> syntax to specify
the password. If you use the <CODE>-p</CODE> option alone, MySQL will
prompt you for the password.)

<LI>

For testing, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with the
<CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  Then you can change the MySQL
grant tables and use the <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> script to check whether
your modifications have the desired effect.  When you are satisfied with your
changes, execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> to tell the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server to start using the new grant tables.  <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: reloading the
grant tables overrides the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  This allows
you to tell the server to begin using the grant tables again without bringing
it down and restarting it.

<LI>

If everything else fails, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with a debugging
option (for example, <CODE>--debug=d,general,query</CODE>). This will print host and
user information about attempted connections, as well as information about
each command issued. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

<LI>

If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant tables and
feel you must post the problem to the mailing list, always provide a
dump of the MySQL grant tables. You can dump the tables with
the <CODE>mysqldump mysql</CODE> command. As always, post your problem using
the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.  In some cases you may need
to restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> to run
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

<P>
<CODE>USAGE</CODE> can be used when you want to create a user that has no privileges.

</P>
<P>
The privileges <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE>, <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE>,
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, <CODE>REPLICATION ...</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> and
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> are new for in version 4.0.2.  To use these new privileges
after upgrading to 4.0.2, you have to run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-grant-tables">2.5.6  Upgrading the Grant Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions, the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege gives the same
rights as the new <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.

</P>
<P>
To revoke the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege from a user, use a <CODE>priv_type</CODE>
value of <CODE>GRANT OPTION</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; REVOKE GRANT OPTION ON ... FROM ...;
</PRE>

<P>
The only <CODE>priv_type</CODE> values you can specify for a table are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>,
<CODE>GRANT OPTION</CODE>, <CODE>INDEX</CODE>, and <CODE>ALTER</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The only <CODE>priv_type</CODE> values you can specify for a column (that is, when
you use a <CODE>column_list</CODE> clause) are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL allows you to create database level privileges even if the
database doesn't exist, to make it easy to prepare for database usage.
Currently MySQL does however not allow one to create table level grants
if the table doesn't exist. MySQL will not automatically revoke any privileges
even if you drop a table or drop a database.

</P>
<P>
You can set global privileges by using <CODE>ON *.*</CODE> syntax.  You can set
database privileges by using <CODE>ON db_name.*</CODE> syntax. If you specify
<CODE>ON *</CODE> and you have a current database, you will set the privileges for
that database.  (<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: if you specify <CODE>ON *</CODE> and you
<STRONG>don't</STRONG> have a current database, you will affect the global privileges!)

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Please note</STRONG>: the <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> wildcards are allowed when
specifying database names in <CODE>GRANT</CODE> commands. This means that if you
wish to use for instance a <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> character as part of a database name,
you should specify it as <SAMP>`\_'</SAMP> in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command, to prevent
the user from being able to access additional databases matching the
wildcard pattern, for example, <CODE>GRANT ... ON `foo\_bar`.* TO ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In order to accommodate granting rights to users from arbitrary hosts,
MySQL supports specifying the <CODE>user_name</CODE> value in the form
<CODE>user@host</CODE>.  If you want to specify a <CODE>user</CODE> string
containing special characters (such as <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>), or a <CODE>host</CODE> string
containing special characters or wildcard characters (such as <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>), you
can quote the user or host name (for example, <CODE>'test-user'@'test-hostname'</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
You can specify wildcards in the hostname.  For example,
<CODE>user@'%.loc.gov'</CODE> applies to <CODE>user</CODE> for any host in the
<CODE>loc.gov</CODE> domain, and <CODE>user@'144.155.166.%'</CODE> applies to <CODE>user</CODE>
for any host in the <CODE>144.155.166</CODE> class C subnet.

</P>
<P>
The simple form <CODE>user</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>user@"%"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't support wildcards in user names.  Anonymous users are
defined by inserting entries with <CODE>User=''</CODE> into the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table or creating an user with an empty name with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: if you allow anonymous users to connect to the MySQL
server, you should also grant privileges to all local users as
<CODE>user@localhost</CODE> because otherwise the anonymous user entry for
the local host in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table will be used when the user
tries to log into the MySQL server from the local machine!

</P>
<P>
You can verify if this applies to you by executing this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT Host,User FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
</PRE>

<P>
For the moment, <CODE>GRANT</CODE> only supports host, table, database, and
column names up to 60 characters long. A user name can be up to 16
characters.

</P>
<P>
The privileges for a table or column are formed from the
logical OR of the privileges at each of the four privilege
levels.  For example, if the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table specifies that a
user has a global <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege, this can't be denied by an
entry at the database, table, or column level.

</P>
<P>
The privileges for a column can be calculated as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
</PRE>

<P>
In most cases, you grant rights to a user at only one of the privilege
levels, so life isn't normally as complicated as above. The details of the
privilege-checking procedure are presented in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_system">4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you grant privileges for a user/hostname combination that does not exist
in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table, an entry is added and remains there until
deleted with a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> command.  In other words, <CODE>GRANT</CODE> may
create <CODE>user</CODE> table entries, but <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> will not remove them;
you must do that explicitly using <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
In MySQL Version 3.22.12 or later,
if a new user is created or if you have global grant privileges, the user's
password will be set to the password specified by the <CODE>IDENTIFIED BY</CODE>
clause, if one is given.  If the user already had a password, it is replaced
by the new one.

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to send the password in clear text you can use the
<CODE>PASSWORD</CODE> option followed by a scrambled password from SQL
function <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> or the C API function
<CODE>make_scrambled_password(char *to, const char *password)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: if you create a new user but do not specify an
<CODE>IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> clause, the user has no password.  This is insecure.

</P>
<P>
Passwords can also be set with the <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you grant privileges for a database, an entry in the <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>
table is created if needed. When all privileges for the database have been
removed with <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>, this entry is deleted.

</P>
<P>
If a user doesn't have any privileges on a table, the table is not displayed
when the user requests a list of tables (for example, with a <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE>
statement). The same is true for <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>WITH GRANT OPTION</CODE> clause gives the user the ability to give
to other users any privileges the user has at the specified privilege level.
You should be careful to whom you give the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege, as two
users with different privileges may be able to join privileges!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR #</CODE>, <CODE>MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR #</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR #</CODE> are new in MySQL version 4.0.2.
These options limit the number of queries/updates and logins the user can
do during one hour. If <CODE>#</CODE> is 0 (default), then this means that there
are no limitations for that user. See section <A HREF="manual.html#User_resources">4.3.7  Limiting user resources</A>.
Note: to specify any of these options for an existing user without adding
other additional privileges, use <CODE>GRANT USAGE ON *.* ... WITH MAX_...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You cannot grant another user a privilege you don't have yourself;
the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege allows you to give away only those privileges
you possess.

</P>
<P>
Be aware that when you grant a user the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege at a
particular privilege level, any privileges the user already possesses (or
is given in the future!) at that level are also grantable by that user.
Suppose you grant a user the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on a database.  If
you then grant the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege on the database and specify
<CODE>WITH GRANT OPTION</CODE>, the user can give away not only the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
privilege, but also <CODE>INSERT</CODE>.  If you then grant the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
privilege to the user on the database, the user can give away the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should not grant <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privileges to a normal user.  If you
do that, the user can try to subvert the privilege system by renaming
tables!

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using table or column privileges for even one user, the
server examines table and column privileges for all users and this will slow
down MySQL a bit.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all privileges are read into memory.
Database, table, and column privileges take effect at once, and
user-level privileges take effect the next time the user connects.
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> or
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE> are noticed by the server immediately.
If you modify the grant tables manually (using <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
etc.), you should execute a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or run
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> to tell the server to reload the grant
tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
The biggest differences between the SQL standard and MySQL versions of
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In MySQL privileges are given for an username + hostname combination
and not only for an username.

<LI>

SQL-99 doesn't have global or database-level privileges, nor does it 
support all the privilege types that MySQL supports.
MySQL doesn't support the SQL-99 <CODE>TRIGGER</CODE> or <CODE>UNDER</CODE>
privileges.

<LI>

SQL-99 privileges are structured in a hierarchal manner. If you remove
an user, all privileges the user has granted are revoked. In
MySQL the granted privileges are not automatically revoked, but
you have to revoke these yourself if needed.

<LI>

In MySQL, if you have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on only some of the
columns in a table, you can execute <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements on the
table; the columns for which you don't have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege
will be set to their default values. SQL-99 requires you to have the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on all columns.

<LI>

With SQL99, when you drop a table, all privileges for the table are revoked.
With SQL-99, when you revoke a privilege, all privileges that were granted based
on the privilege are also revoked. In MySQL, privileges can be
dropped only with explicit <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands or by manipulating the
MySQL grant tables.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="User_names" HREF="manual_toc.html#User_names">4.3.2  MySQL User Names and Passwords</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are several distinctions between the way user names and passwords are
used by MySQL and the way they are used by Unix or Windows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User names, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have
nothing to do with Unix user names (login names) or Windows user names.  Most
MySQL clients by default try to log in using the current Unix user
name as the MySQL user name, but that is for convenience only.
Client programs allow a different name to be specified with the <CODE>-u</CODE> or
<CODE>--user</CODE> options. This means that you can't make a database secure in
any way unless all MySQL user names have passwords.  Anyone may
attempt to connect to the server using any name, and they will succeed if
they specify any name that doesn't have a password.

<LI>

MySQL user names can be up to 16 characters long; Unix user names
typically are limited to 8 characters.

<LI>

MySQL passwords have nothing to do with Unix passwords.  There is no
necessary connection between the password you use to log in to a Unix machine
and the password you use to access a database on that machine.

<LI>

MySQL encrypts passwords using a different algorithm than the
one used during the Unix login process.  See the descriptions of the
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> and <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> functions in section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.  Note that even if the password is stored 'scrambled', and
knowing your 'scrambled' password is enough to be able to connect to
the MySQL server!
From version 4.1, MySQL employs a different password and login mechanism
that is secure even if TCP/IP packets are sniffed and/or the mysql
database is captured.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL users and their privileges are normally created with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you login to a MySQL server with a command-line client you
should specify the password with <CODE>--password=your-password</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Connecting">4.2.8  Connecting to the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql --user=monty --password=guess database_name
</PRE>

<P>
If you want the client to prompt for a password, you should use
<CODE>--password</CODE> without any argument

</P>

<PRE>
mysql --user=monty --password database_name
</PRE>

<P>
or the short form:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -u monty -p database_name
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in the last example the password is <STRONG>not</STRONG> 'database_name'.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the <CODE>-p</CODE> option to supply a password you should do so
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -u monty -pguess database_name
</PRE>

<P>
On some systems, the library call that MySQL uses to prompt for a
password will automatically cut the password to 8 characters. Internally
MySQL doesn't have any limit for the length of the password.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Privilege_changes" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A></H3>

<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all grant table contents are read into memory and
become effective at that point.

</P>
<P>
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using <CODE>GRANT</CODE>,
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> are noticed by the server immediately.

</P>
<P>
If you modify the grant tables manually (using <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
etc.), you should execute a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or run
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE> to tell the
server to reload the grant tables. Otherwise, your changes will have <EM>no
effect</EM> until you restart the server. If you change the grant tables manually
but forget to reload the privileges, you will be wondering why your changes
don't seem to make any difference!

</P>
<P>
When the server notices that the grant tables have been changed,
existing client connections are affected as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Table and column privilege changes take effect with the client's next
request.

<LI>

Database privilege changes take effect at the next <CODE>USE db_name</CODE>
command.

<LI>

Global privilege changes and password changes take effect the next time
the client connects.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Default_privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
<A NAME="IDX531"></A>

</P>
<P>
After installing MySQL, you set up the initial access privileges by
running <CODE>scripts/mysql_install_db</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Quick_install">2.3.1  Quick Installation Overview</A>.
The <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script starts up the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server, then initialises the grant tables to contain the following set
of privileges:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user is created as a superuser who can do
anything.  Connections must be made from the local host.

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>:
The initial <CODE>root</CODE> password is empty, so anyone can connect as <CODE>root</CODE>
<EM>without a password</EM> and be granted all privileges.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX532"></A>
An anonymous user is created that can do anything with databases that have a
name of <CODE>'test'</CODE> or starting with <CODE>'test_'</CODE>.  Connections must be
made from the local host.  This means any local user can connect without a
password and be treated as the anonymous user.

<LI>

Other privileges are denied.  For example, normal users can't use
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: the default privileges are different for Windows.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_running">2.6.1.3  Running MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
Because your installation is initially wide open, one of the first things you
should do is specify a password for the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user.  You can do this as follows (note that you specify the
password using the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost=PASSWORD('new_password');
</PRE>

<P>
Replace <CODE>'new_password'</CODE> with the password that you want to use.

</P>
<P>
If you know what you are doing, you can also directly manipulate the
privilege tables:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
    -&#62;     WHERE user='root';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
Another way to set the password is by using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root password new_password
</PRE>

<P>
Only users with write/update access to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can change the
password for other users.  All normal users (not anonymous ones) can only
change their own password with either of the above commands or with
<CODE>SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('new_password')</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you update the password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table directly using
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, you must tell the server to re-read the grant tables (with
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE>), because the change will go unnoticed otherwise.

</P>
<P>
Once the <CODE>root</CODE> password has been set, thereafter you must supply that
password when you connect to the server as <CODE>root</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You may wish to leave the <CODE>root</CODE> password blank so that you don't need
to specify it while you perform additional setup or testing. However, be sure
to set it before using your installation for any real production work.

</P>
<P>
See the <CODE>scripts/mysql_install_db</CODE> script to see how it sets up
the default privileges.  You can use this as a basis to see how to
add other users.

</P>
<P>
If you want the initial privileges to be different from those just described
above, you can modify <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> before you run it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX533"></A>
<A NAME="IDX534"></A>
To re-create the grant tables completely, remove all the <TT>`.frm'</TT>,
<TT>`.MYI'</TT>, and <TT>`.MYD'</TT> files in the directory containing the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  (This is the directory named <TT>`mysql'</TT> under
the database directory, which is listed when you run <CODE>mysqld
--help</CODE>.) Then run the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script, possibly after
editing it first to have the privileges you want.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: for MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
you should not delete the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files.  If you accidentally do this,
you should copy them back from your MySQL distribution before
running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.

<P>
You can add users two different ways: by using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements
or by manipulating the MySQL grant tables directly.  The
preferred method is to use <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements, because they are
more concise and less error-prone. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are also several contributed programs (such as <CODE>phpMyAdmin</CODE>)
that can be used to create and administrate users.

</P>
<P>
The following examples show how to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client to set up new
users.  These examples assume that privileges are set up according to the
defaults described in the previous section.  This means that to make changes,
you must be on the same machine where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running, you must
connect as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user, and the <CODE>root</CODE> user must
have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database and the
<CODE>RELOAD</CODE> administrative privilege.  Also, if you have changed the
<CODE>root</CODE> user password, you must specify it for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> commands here.

</P>
<P>
First, use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> program to connect to the server as the
MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
</PRE>

<P>
Then you can add new users by issuing <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@localhost
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@'%'
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&#62; GRANT RELOAD,PROCESS ON *.* TO admin@localhost;
mysql&#62; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO dummy@localhost;
</PRE>

<P>
These <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements set up three new users:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>monty</CODE>
<DD>
A full superuser who can connect to the server from anywhere, but who must
use a password <CODE>'some_pass'</CODE> to do so.  Note that we must issue
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements for both <CODE>monty@localhost</CODE> and
<CODE>monty@"%"</CODE>.  If we don't add the entry with <CODE>localhost</CODE>, the
anonymous user entry for <CODE>localhost</CODE> that is created by
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> takes precedence when we connect from the local
host, because it has a more specific <CODE>Host</CODE> field value and thus comes
earlier in the <CODE>user</CODE> table sort order.

<DT><CODE>admin</CODE>
<DD>
A user who can connect from <CODE>localhost</CODE> without a password and who is
granted the <CODE>RELOAD</CODE> and <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> administrative privileges.
This allows the user to execute the <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqladmin flush-*</CODE> commands, as well as
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> .  No database-level privileges are granted.
(They can be granted later by issuing additional <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements.)

<DT><CODE>dummy</CODE>
<DD>
A user who can connect without a password, but only from the local host.
No privileges are granted--the <CODE>USAGE</CODE> privilege type allows you
to create a user with no privileges. It has the effect of setting all
the global privileges to <CODE>'N'</CODE>.  It is assumed that you will grant
specific privileges to the account later.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX540"></A>
<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
You can also add the same user access information directly by issuing
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements and then telling the server to reload the grant
tables:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES('localhost','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
    -&#62;          'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES('%','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
    -&#62;          'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user SET Host='localhost',User='admin',
    -&#62;           Reload_priv='Y', Process_priv='Y';
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62;                  VALUES('localhost','dummy','');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
Depending on your MySQL version, you may have to use a different number
of <CODE>'Y'</CODE> values above. (Versions prior to Version 3.22.11 have
fewer privilege columns, and versions from 4.0.2 on have more.)  For the
<CODE>admin</CODE> user, the more readable extended <CODE>INSERT</CODE> syntax using
<CODE>SET</CODE> that is available starting with Version 3.22.11 is used.

</P>
<P>
Note that to set up a superuser, you need only create a <CODE>user</CODE> table
entry with the privilege fields set to <CODE>'Y'</CODE>.  No <CODE>db</CODE> or
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries are necessary.

</P>
<P>
In the last <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement (for the <CODE>dummy</CODE> user), only the
<CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Password</CODE> columns in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table record are assigned values. None of the privilege columns are set
explicitly, so MySQL assigns them all the default value of <CODE>'N'</CODE>.
This is the same thing that <CODE>GRANT USAGE</CODE> does.

</P>
<P>
The following example adds a user <CODE>custom</CODE> who can
access the <CODE>bankaccount</CODE> database only from the local host,
the <CODE>expenses</CODE> database only from the host <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE>, and
the <CODE>customer</CODE> database only from the host <CODE>server.domain</CODE>.  He wants
to use the password <CODE>obscure</CODE> from all three hosts.

</P>
<P>
To set up this user's privileges using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements, run these
commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    -&#62;     ON bankaccount.*
    -&#62;     TO custom@localhost
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'obscure';
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    -&#62;     ON expenses.*
    -&#62;     TO custom@'whitehouse.gov'
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'obscure';
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    -&#62;     ON customer.*
    -&#62;     TO custom@'server.domain'
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'obscure';
</PRE>

<P>
To set up the user's privileges by modifying the grant tables directly,
run these commands (note the <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> at the end):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('localhost','custom',PASSWORD('obscure'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('whitehouse.gov','custom',PASSWORD('obscure'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('server.domain','custom',PASSWORD('obscure'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
    -&#62; (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
    -&#62;  Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    -&#62; VALUES
    -&#62; ('localhost','bankaccount','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
    -&#62; (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
    -&#62;  Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    -&#62; VALUES
    -&#62; ('whitehouse.gov','expenses','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
    -&#62; (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
    -&#62;  Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    -&#62; VALUES('server.domain','customer','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
As in the preceding example that used <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements, you may need
to use a different number of <CODE>'Y'</CODE> values, depending on your version of
MySQL.

</P>
<P>
The first three <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements add <CODE>user</CODE> table entries that
allow user <CODE>custom</CODE> to connect from the various hosts with the given
password, but grant no permissions to him (all privileges are set to the
default value of <CODE>'N'</CODE>).  The next three <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements add
<CODE>db</CODE> table entries that grant privileges to <CODE>custom</CODE> for the
<CODE>bankaccount</CODE>, <CODE>expenses</CODE>, and <CODE>customer</CODE> databases, but only
when accessed from the proper hosts.  As usual, after you modify the grant
tables directly , you must tell the server to reload them (with
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE>) so that the privilege changes take effect.

</P>
<P>
If you want to give a specific user access from any machine in a given
domain (for example, <CODE>mydomain.com</CODE>), you can issue a <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
statement like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ...
    -&#62;     ON *.*
    -&#62;     TO myusername@'%.mydomain.com'
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
</PRE>

<P>
To do the same thing by modifying the grant tables directly, do this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES ('%.mydomain.com', 'myusername',
    -&#62;             PASSWORD('mypassword'),...);
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<PRE>
DROP USER user_name
</PRE>

<P>
This command was added to MySQL 4.1.1.

</P>
<P>
It deletes a user that doesn't have any privileges.

</P>
<P>
To delete a user from MySQL you should do things in the following order:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Check which privileges the user has with <CODE>SHOW PRIVILEGES</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_PRIVILEGES">4.5.7.11  <CODE>SHOW PRIVILEGES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

Delete all privileges from the user with <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Delete the user with <CODE>DROP USER</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
If you are using and older MySQL version you should first revoke the
privileges and then delete the user with:

</P>

<PRE>
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='username' and host='hostname';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="User_resources" HREF="manual_toc.html#User_resources">4.3.7  Limiting user resources</A></H3>

<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.2 one can limit certain resources per user.

</P>
<P>
So far, the only available method of limiting usage of MySQL
server resources has been setting the <CODE>max_user_connections</CODE>
startup variable to a non-zero value. But this method is strictly
global and does not allow for management of individual users, which
could be of particular interest to Internet Service Providers.

</P>
<P>
Therefore, management of three resources is introduced on the
individual user level:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Number of all queries per hour:

All commands that could be run by a user.
<LI>Number of all updates per hour:

Any command that changes any table or database.
<LI>Number of connections made per hour:

New connections opened per hour.
</UL>

<P>
A user in the aforementioned context is a single entry in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table, which is uniquely identified by its <CODE>user</CODE>
and <CODE>host</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
All users are by default not limited in using the above resources,
unless the limits are granted to them. These limits can be granted
<STRONG>only</STRONG> via global <CODE>GRANT (*.*)</CODE>, using this syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
GRANT ... WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR N1
               MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR N2
               MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR N3;
</PRE>

<P>
One can specify any combination of the above resources.
<CODE>N1</CODE>, <CODE>N2</CODE>, and <CODE>N3</CODE> are integers and represent counts per hour.

</P>
<P>
If a user reaches the limit on number of connections within one hour, no
further connections will be accepted until that hour is up. Similarly,
if the user reaches the limit on number of queries or updates, further
queries or updates will be rejected until the hour is up. In all cases,
an appropriate error message shall be issued.

</P>
<P>
Current usage values for a particular user can be flushed (set to zero)
by issuing a <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement with any of the above clauses,
including a <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement with the current values.

</P>
<P>
Also, current values for all users will be flushed if privileges are
reloaded (in the server or using <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>)
or if the <CODE>FLUSH USER_RESOURCES</CODE> command is issued.

</P>
<P>
The feature is enabled as soon as a single user is granted with any
of the limiting <CODE>GRANT</CODE> clauses.

</P>
<P>
As a prerequisite for enabling this feature, the <CODE>user</CODE> table in
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database must contain the additional columns, as
defined in the table creation scripts <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_install_db.sh</CODE> in <TT>`scripts'</TT> subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
In most cases you should use <CODE>GRANT</CODE> to set up your users/passwords,
so the following only applies for advanced users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The examples in the preceding sections illustrate an important principle:
when you store a non-empty password using <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements, you must use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function to encrypt it.  This
is because the <CODE>user</CODE> table stores passwords in encrypted form, not as
plaintext.  If you forget that fact, you are likely to attempt to set
passwords like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('%','jeffrey','biscuit');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
The result is that the plaintext value <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE> is stored as the
password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  When the user <CODE>jeffrey</CODE> attempts to
connect to the server using this password, the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client encrypts
it with <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, generates an authentification vector
based on <STRONG>encrypted</STRONG> password and a random number,
obtained from server, and sends the result to the server.
The server uses the <CODE>password</CODE> value in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
(that is <STRONG>not encrypted</STRONG> value <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE>)
to perform the same calculations, and compares results.
The comparison fails and the server rejects the
connection:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u jeffrey -pbiscuit test
Access denied
</PRE>

<P>
Passwords must be encrypted when they are inserted in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table, so the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement should have been specified like this
instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('%','jeffrey',PASSWORD('biscuit'));
</PRE>

<P>
You must also use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function when you use <CODE>SET
PASSWORD</CODE> statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR jeffrey@"%" = PASSWORD('biscuit');
</PRE>

<P>
If you set passwords using the <CODE>GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> statement
or the <CODE>mysqladmin password</CODE> command, the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function
is unnecessary.  They both take care of encrypting the password for you,
so you would specify a password of <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO jeffrey@"%" IDENTIFIED BY 'biscuit';
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u jeffrey password biscuit
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> is different from Unix password encryption.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Password_security" HREF="manual_toc.html#Password_security">4.3.9  Keeping Your Password Secure</A></H3>

<P>
It is inadvisable to specify your password in a way that exposes it to
discovery by other users.  The methods you can use to specify your password
when you run client programs are listed here, along with an assessment of
the risks of each method:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Never give a normal user access to the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table. Knowing
the encrypted password for a user makes it possible to login as this
user.  The passwords are only scrambled so that one shouldn't be able to
see the real password you used (if you happen to use a similar password
with your other applications).

<LI>

Use a <CODE>-pyour_pass</CODE> or <CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE> option on the command
line.  This is convenient but insecure, because your password becomes visible
to system status programs (such as <CODE>ps</CODE>) that may be invoked by other
users to display command-lines.  (MySQL clients typically overwrite
the command-line argument with zeroes during their initialisation sequence,
but there is still a brief interval during which the value is visible.)

<LI>

Use a <CODE>-p</CODE> or <CODE>--password</CODE> option (with no <CODE>your_pass</CODE> value
specified).  In this case, the client program solicits the password from
the terminal:
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u user_name -p
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> characters represent your password.

It is more secure to enter your password this way than to specify it on the
command-line because it is not visible to other users.  However, this method
of entering a password is suitable only for programs that you run
interactively.  If you want to invoke a client from a script that runs
non-interactively, there is no opportunity to enter the password from the
terminal. On some systems, you may even find that the first line of your
script is read and interpreted (incorrectly) as your password!

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX557"></A>
Store your password in a configuration file.  For example, you can list your
password in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> section of the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your
home directory:


<PRE>
[client]
password=your_pass
</PRE>

If you store your password in <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>, the file should not be group or
world readable or writable.  Make sure the file's access mode is <CODE>400</CODE>
or <CODE>600</CODE>.

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.
<LI>

You can store your password in the <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> environment variable, but
this method must be considered extremely insecure and should not be used.
Some versions of <CODE>ps</CODE> include an option to display the environment of
running processes; your password will be in plain sight for all to see if
you set <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE>.  Even on systems without such a version of
<CODE>ps</CODE>, it is unwise to assume there is no other method to observe process
environments. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.
</UL>

<P>
All in all, the safest methods are to have the client program prompt for the
password or to specify the password in a properly protected <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>
file.

<H4><A NAME="Secure_basics" HREF="manual_toc.html#Secure_basics">4.3.10.1  Basics</A></H4>

<P>
Beginning with version 4.0.0,
MySQL has support for SSL encrypted connections. To understand how MySQL
uses SSL, it's necessary to explain some basic SSL and X509 concepts. People
who are already familiar with them can skip this part.

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL uses unencrypted connections between the client and the
server. This means that someone could watch all your traffic and look at
the data being sent or received.  They could even change the data
while it is in transit between client and server. Sometimes you need to
move information over public networks in a secure fashion; in such cases,
using an unencrypted connection is unacceptable.

</P>
<P>
SSL is a protocol that uses different encryption algorithms to ensure
that data received over a public network can be trusted. It has
mechanisms to detect any change, loss or replay of data. SSL also
incorporates algorithms to recognise and provide identity verification
using the X509 standard.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX560"></A>
Encryption is the way to make any kind of data unreadable. In fact,
today's practice requires many additional security elements from
encryption algorithms.  They should resist many kind of known attacks
like just messing with the order of encrypted messages or replaying data
twice.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX561"></A>
X509 is a standard that makes it possible to identify someone on the
Internet.  It is most commonly used in e-commerce applications. In basic
terms, there should be some company (called a ``Certificate Authority'') that
assigns electronic certificates to anyone who needs them. Certificates
rely on asymmetric encryption algorithms that have two encryption keys
(a public key and a secret key). A certificate owner can prove his identity by
showing his certificate to other party. A certificate consists of its
owner's public key. Any data encrypted with this public key can be
decrypted only using the corresponding secret key, which is held by the owner
of the certificate.

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't use encrypted connections by default, because doing so
would make the client/server protocol much slower. Any kind of
additional functionality requires the computer to do additional work and
encrypting data is a CPU-intensive operation that requires time and can delay
MySQL main tasks. By default MySQL is tuned to be fast as possible.

</P>
<P>
If you need more information about SSL, X509, or encryption, you should use
your favourite Internet search engine and search for keywords in which you are
interested.

MySQL can check X509 certificate attributes in addition to the
normal username/password scheme. All the usual options are still
required (username, password, IP address mask, database/table name).

</P>
<P>
There are different possibilities to limit connections:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Without any SSL or X509 options, all kind of encrypted/unencrypted
connections are allowed if the username and password are valid.

<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE SSL</CODE> option limits the server to allow only SSL
encrypted connections. Note that this option can be omitted
if there are any ACL records which allow non-SSL connections.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO root@localhost
    -&#62; IDENTIFIED BY "goodsecret" REQUIRE SSL;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE X509</CODE> means that the client should have a valid certificate
but we do not care about the exact certificate, issuer or subject.
The only restriction is that it should be possible to verify its
signature with one of the CA certificates.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO root@localhost
    -&#62; IDENTIFIED BY "goodsecret" REQUIRE X509;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE ISSUER "issuer"</CODE> places a restriction on connection attempts:
The client must present a valid X509 certificate issued by CA <CODE>"issuer"</CODE>.
Using X509 certificates always implies encryption, so the <CODE>SSL</CODE> option
is unneccessary.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO root@localhost
    -&#62; IDENTIFIED BY "goodsecret"
    -&#62; REQUIRE ISSUER "C=FI, ST=Some-State, L=Helsinki,
    "&#62; O=MySQL Finland AB, CN=Tonu Samuel/Email=tonu@mysql.com";
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE SUBJECT "subject"</CODE> requires clients to have valid X509
certificate with subject <CODE>"subject"</CODE> on it. If the client presents a
certificate that is valid but has a different <CODE>"subject"</CODE>, the connection
is disallowed.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO root@localhost

    "&#62; CN=Tonu Samuel/Email=tonu@mysql.com";
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE CIPHER "cipher"</CODE> is needed to assure enough strong ciphers
and keylengths will be used. SSL itself can be weak if old algorithms
with short encryption keys are used. Using this option, we can ask for
some exact cipher method to allow a connection.


<PRE>

    -&#62; IDENTIFIED BY "goodsecret"
    -&#62; REQUIRE CIPHER "EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA";

The <CODE>SUBJECT</CODE>, <CODE>ISSUER</CODE>, and <CODE>CIPHER</CODE> options can be
combined in the <CODE>REQUIRE</CODE> clause like this:

<P>
The following table lists options that are used for specifying the
use of SSL, certificate files, and key files.
These options are available beginning with MySQL 4.0. They may
be given on the command line or in option files.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--ssl</CODE>
<DD>
For the server, specifies that the server allows SSL connections.
For a client program, allows the client to connect to the server using SSL.
This option itself is not sufficient to cause an SSL connection to be used.
You must also specify the
<CODE>--ssl-ca</CODE>, <CODE>--ssl-cert</CODE>, and <CODE>--ssl-key</CODE> options.

Note that this option doesn't <STRONG>require</STRONG> an SSL connection.
For example, if the server or client are compiled without SSL support,
a normal unencrypted connection will be used.

The secure way to ensure that a SSL connection will be used is
to create an account on the server that includes a
<CODE>REQUIRE SSL</CODE> clause in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement.
Then use this account to connect to the server, with both a server and client
that have SSL support enabled.

You can use this option to indicate that the connection should not use SSL.
Do this by specifying the option as <CODE>--skip-ssl</CODE> or <CODE>--ssl=0</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--ssl-ca=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
The path to a file with a list of trusted SSL CAs.

<DT><CODE>--ssl-capath=directory_name</CODE>
<DD>
The path to a directory which contains trusted 
SSL CA certificates in pem format.

<DT><CODE>--ssl-cert=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the SSL certificate file to use
used for establishing a secure connection.

<DT><CODE>--ssl-cipher=cipher_list</CODE>
<DD>
A list of allowable ciphers to use for SSL encryption.
<CODE>cipher_list</CODE> has the same format as the <CODE>openssl ciphers</CODE>
command.

Example: <CODE>--ssl-cipher=ALL:-AES:-EXP</CODE>

<DT><CODE>--ssl-key=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the SSL key file to use
used for establishing a secure connection.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
<A NAME="IDX567"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL tables are stored as files, it is easy to do a
backup. To get a consistent backup, do a <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> on the
relevant tables followed by <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> for the tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOCK_TABLES">6.7.5  <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> and <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> Syntax</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.
You only need a read lock; this allows other threads to continue to
query the tables while you are making a copy of the files in the
database directory.  The <CODE>FLUSH TABLE</CODE> is needed to ensure that
the all active index pages is written to disk before you start the backup.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.56 and 4.0.12 <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> will not allow you
to overwrite existing files as this would be a security risk.

</P>
<P>
If you want to make an SQL level backup of a table, you can use
<CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE> or <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BACKUP_TABLE">4.4.2  <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Another way to back up a database is to use the <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> program or
the <CODE>mysqlhotcopy script</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.6  <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlhotcopy">4.8.7  <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>, Copying MySQL Databases and Tables</A>.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Do a full backup of your database:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqldump --tab=/path/to/some/dir --opt db_name

or

shell&#62; mysqlhotcopy db_name /path/to/some/dir
</PRE>

You can also simply copy all table files (<TT>`*.frm'</TT>, <TT>`*.MYD'</TT>, and
<TT>`*.MYI'</TT> files) as long as the server isn't updating anything.
The script <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> does use this method.  (But note that these
methods
will not work if your database contains <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
does not store table contents in database directories, and <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>
works only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables.)

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX568"></A>
Stop <CODE>mysqld</CODE> if it's running, then start it with the
<CODE>--log-bin[=file_name]</CODE> option.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>. The binary
log file(s) provide you with the information you need to replicate
changes to the database that are made subsequent to the point at which
you executed <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
If your MySQL server is a slave, whatever backup method you choose,
when you backup your slave's data, you should also backup the
<TT>`master.info'</TT> and <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT> files
which are always needed to resume replication after you restore
the slave's data. If your slave is subject to replicating <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> commands, you should also backup the <TT>`SQL-LOAD*'</TT> files
which may exist in the <TT>`slave-load-tmpdir'</TT> (which is <TT>`tmpdir'</TT>
by default) directory. The slave will need these files to resume
replication of any interrupted <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. 

</P>
<P>
If you have to restore something, try to recover your tables using
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> first.  That should work in
99.9% of all cases.  If <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> fails, try the following
procedure (this will only work if you have started MySQL with
<CODE>--log-bin</CODE>, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>):

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Restore the original <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> backup, or binary backup.
<LI>

Execute the following command to re-run the updates in the binary log:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.[0-9]* | mysql
</PRE>

In your case you may want to re-run only certain binlogs, from
certain positions (usually you want to re-run all binlogs from the
date of the restored backup, possibly excepted some wrong queries).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlbinlog">4.8.4  <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>, Executing the queries from a binary log</A> for more information on the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>
utility and how to use it.

If you are using the update log (which will be removed in MySQL 5.0)
you can execute the content of the update log like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ls -1 -t -r hostname.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
<CODE>ls</CODE> is used to get all the update log files in the right order.

</P>
<P>
You can also do selective backups with <CODE>SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
FROM tbl_name</CODE> and restore with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' REPLACE
...</CODE> To avoid duplicate records, you need a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> or a
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key in the table. The <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> keyword causes old records
to be replaced with new ones when a new record duplicates an old record on
a unique key value.

</P>
<P>
If you get performance problems in making backups on your system, you can
solve this by setting up replication and do the backups on the slave
instead of on the master. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Intro">4.10.1  Introduction</A>.

<P>
Note that the statement may produce many rows of information for each checked table.
The last row will be of <CODE>Msg_type status</CODE> and should normally be
<CODE>OK</CODE>.
If you don't get <CODE>OK</CODE>, or <CODE>Table is already up to
date</CODE> you should normally run a repair of the table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A>. <CODE>Table is already up to date</CODE> means that the storage
manager for the table indicated that there was no need to check the table.

</P>
<P>
The different check types are as follows:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>QUICK</CODE> </TD><TD> Don't scan the rows to check for incorrect links.

<P>
For dynamically sized <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, a started check will always
do a <CODE>MEDIUM</CODE> check. For statically sized rows, we skip the row scan
for <CODE>QUICK</CODE> and <CODE>FAST</CODE> as the rows are very seldom corrupted.

</P>
<P>
You can combine check options, as in the following example that does
a quick check on the table to see whether it was
closed properly:

</P>

<PRE>
CHECK TABLE test_table FAST QUICK;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: that in some cases <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will change the
table!  This happens if the table is marked as 'corrupted' or 'not
closed properly' but <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> didn't find any problems in the
table.  In this case, <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will mark the table as okay.

</P>
<P>
If a table is corrupted, then it's most likely that the problem is in
the indexes and not in the data part.  All of the above check types
checks the indexes thoroughly and should thus find most errors.

</P>
<P>
If you just want to check a table that you assume is okay, you should use
no check options or the <CODE>QUICK</CODE> option. The latter should be used
when you are in a hurry and can take the very small risk that
<CODE>QUICK</CODE> didn't find an error in the datafile. (In most cases
MySQL should find, under normal usage, any error in the datafile.
If this happens then the table will be marked as 'corrupted',
in which case the table can't be used until it's repaired.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>FAST</CODE> and <CODE>CHANGED</CODE> are mostly intended to be used from a
script (for example to be executed from <CODE>cron</CODE>) if you want to check your
table from time to time. In most cases, <CODE>FAST</CODE> is to be prefered
over <CODE>CHANGED</CODE>.  (The only case when it isn't is when you suspect
that you have found a bug in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> code.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>EXTENDED</CODE> is only to be used after you have run a normal check but
still get strange errors from a table when MySQL tries to
update a row or find a row by key (this is very unlikely if a
normal check has succeeded!).

</P>
<P>
Some things reported by <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> can't be corrected automatically:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>Found row where the auto_increment column has the value 0</CODE>.

This means that you have a row in the table where the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index column contains the value 0.
(It's possible to create a row where the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column is 0 by
explicitly setting the column to 0 with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement.)

This isn't an error in itself, but could cause trouble if you decide to
dump the table and restore it or do an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on the
table. In this case, the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column will change value,
according to the rules of <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns, which could cause
problems such as a duplicate key error.

To get rid of the warning, just execute an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement
to set the column to some other value than 0.

<P>
Note that the statement may produce many rows of information for each repaired
table.
The last one row will be of <CODE>Msg_type status</CODE> and should
normally be <CODE>OK</CODE>.
If you don't get <CODE>OK</CODE>, you should try
repairing the table with <CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover</CODE>, as <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>
does not yet implement all the options of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. In the near
future, we will make it more flexible.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>QUICK</CODE> is given, <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> tries to repair
only the index tree.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>EXTENDED</CODE>, MySQL will create the index row
by row instead of creating one index at a time with sorting; this may be
better than sorting on fixed-length keys if you have long <CODE>CHAR</CODE>
keys that compress very well.  This type of repair is like that done by
<CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As of <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0.2, there is a <CODE>USE_FRM</CODE> mode for <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>.
Use it if the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file is missing or if its header is corrupted.
In this mode MySQL will recreate the table, using information from the
<TT>`.frm'</TT> file. This kind of repair cannot be done with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies during a <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>,
it's essential that you do at once another <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> on the table
before executing any other commands on it. (It's of course always good
to start with a backup).  In the worst case you can have a new clean
index file without information about the datafile and when the next
command you do may overwrite the datafile.  This is not a likely, but
possible scenario.

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.1.1, <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> commands are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1 they are written to the binary
log unless the optional <CODE>NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG</CODE> keyword 
(or its alias <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>) was used.

<H3><A NAME="Table_maintenance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A></H3>

<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
repair tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
To check/repair MyISAM tables (<TT>`.MYI'</TT> and <TT>`.MYD'</TT>) you should
use the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility. To check/repair ISAM tables
(<TT>`.ISM'</TT> and <TT>`.ISD'</TT>) you should use the <CODE>isamchk</CODE>
utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
In the following text we will talk about <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, but everything
also applies to the old <CODE>isamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility to get information about your
database tables, check and repair them, or optimise them.  The following
sections describe how to invoke <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (including a
description of its options), how to set up a table maintenance schedule,
and how to use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to perform its various functions.

</P>
<P>
You can, in most cases, also use the command <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLES</CODE> to
optimise and repair tables, but this is not as fast or reliable (in case
of real fatal errors) as <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  On the other hand,
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is easier to use and you don't have to worry about
flushing tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Even though the repair in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is quite secure, it's always a
good idea to make a backup <EM>before</EM> doing a repair (or anything that could
make a lot of changes to a table)

</P>



<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_syntax" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_syntax">4.4.6.1  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Invocation Syntax</A></H4>

<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk [options] tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>options</CODE> specify what you want <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to do.  They are
described here.  (You can also get a list of options by invoking
<CODE>myisamchk --help</CODE>.)  With no options, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> simply checks your
table.  To get more information or to tell <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to take corrective
action, specify options as described here and in the following sections.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is the database table you want to check/repair.  If you run
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> somewhere other than in the database directory, you must
specify the path to the file, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> has no idea where your
database is located.  Actually, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> doesn't care whether
the files you are working on are located in a database directory; you can
copy the files that correspond to a database table into another location and
perform recovery operations on them there.

</P>
<P>
You can name several tables on the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command-line if you
wish.  You can also specify a name as an index file
name (with the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> suffix), which allows you to specify all
tables in a directory by using the pattern <TT>`*.MYI'</TT>.
For example, if you are in a database directory, you can check all the
tables in the directory like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk *.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the tables there
by specifying the path to the directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a wildcard
with the path to the MySQL data directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
The recommended way to quickly check all tables is:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
isamchk --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to check all tables and repair all tables that are corrupted,
you can use the following line:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state -O key_buffer=64M \
          -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M \
          /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
isamchk --silent --force -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M \
        -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
The above assumes that you have more than 64 M free.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you get an error like:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk: warning: 1 clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you are trying to check a table that has been updated by
another program (like the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server) that hasn't yet closed
the file or that has died without closing the file properly.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running, you must force a sync/close of all
tables with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> and ensure that no one is using the
tables while you are running <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  In MySQL Version 3.23
the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
instead of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check tables.

</TABLE>

<CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE> is used when the keys are repaired by sorting
keys, which is the normal case when you use <CODE>--recover</CODE>.

<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> is used when you are checking the table with
<CODE>--extended-check</CODE> or when the keys are repaired by inserting key
row by row in to the table (like when doing normal inserts). Repairing
through the key buffer is used in the following cases:


<UL>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>--safe-recover</CODE>.
<LI>

If the temporary files needed to sort the keys would be more than twice
as big as when creating the key file directly.  This is often the case
when you have big <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> keys as the
sort needs to store the whole keys during sorting. If you have lots
of temporary space and you can force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to repair by sorting
you can use the <CODE>--sort-recover</CODE> option.
</UL>

Reparing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than using
sorting, but is also much slower.

If you want a faster repair, set the above variables to about 1/4 of your
available memory.  You can set both variables to big values, as only one
of the above buffers will be used at a time.

<DT><CODE>-s or --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur. You can use <CODE>-s</CODE>
twice (<CODE>-ss</CODE>) to make <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> very silent.
<DT><CODE>-v or --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Print more information. This can be used with <CODE>-d</CODE> and
<CODE>-e</CODE>. Use <CODE>-v</CODE> multiple times (<CODE>-vv</CODE>, <CODE>-vvv</CODE>) for more
verbosity!
<DT><CODE>-V or --version</CODE>
<DD>
Print the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> version and exit.
<DT><CODE>-w or, --wait</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of giving an error if the table is locked, wait until the table
is unlocked before continuing.  Note that if you are running <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
on the table with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>, the table can only be locked
by another <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c or --check</CODE>
<DD>
Check table for errors. This is the default operation if you are not
giving <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> any options that override this.

<DT><CODE>-e or --extend-check</CODE>
<DD>
Check the table very thoroughly (which is quite slow if you have many
indexes).  This option should only be used in extreme cases.  Normally,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk --medium-check</CODE> should, in most
cases, be able to find out if there are any errors in the table.

If you are using <CODE>--extended-check</CODE> and have much memory, you should
increase the value of <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> a lot!

<DT><CODE>-F or --fast</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.
<DT><CODE>-C or --check-only-changed</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that have changed since the last check.
<DT><CODE>-f or --force</CODE>
<DD>
Restart <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> with <CODE>-r</CODE> (repair) on the table, if
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> finds any errors in the table.
<DT><CODE>-i or --information</CODE>
<DD>
Print informational statistics about the table that is checked.
<DT><CODE>-m or --medium-check</CODE>
<DD>
Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99% of all errors.
Should, however, be good enough for most cases.
<DT><CODE>-U or --update-state</CODE>
<DD>
Store in the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file when the table was checked and if the table crashed.  This should be used to get full benefit of the
<CODE>--check-only-changed</CODE> option, but you shouldn't use this
option if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is using the table and you are
running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-T or --read-only</CODE>
<DD>
Don't mark table as checked. This is useful if you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
to check a table that is in use by some other application that doesn't
use locking (like <CODE>mysqld --skip-external-locking</CODE>).

The following options are used if you start <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> with
<CODE>-r</CODE> or <CODE>-o</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-B or --backup</CODE>
<DD>
Make a backup of the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file as <TT>`filename-time.BAK'</TT>
<DT><CODE>--correct-checksum</CODE>
<DD>
Correct checksum information for table.
<DT><CODE>-D # or --data-file-length=#</CODE>
<DD>
Max length of datafile (when re-creating datafile when it's 'full').
<DT><CODE>-e or --extend-check</CODE>
<DD>
Try to recover every possible row from the datafile.
Normally this will also find a lot of garbage rows. Don't use this option
if you are not totally desperate.
<DT><CODE>-f or --force</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite old temporary files (<TT>`table_name.TMD'</TT>) instead of aborting.
<DT><CODE>-k # or --keys-used=#</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using <CODE>ISAM</CODE>, tells the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> storage engine to update only the
first <CODE>#</CODE> indexes.  If you are using <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, tells which keys
to use, where each binary bit stands for one key (first key is bit 0).
This can be used to get faster inserts!  Deactivated indexes can be
reactivated by using <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-l or --no-symlinks</CODE>
<DD>
Do not follow symbolic links. Normally <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> repairs the
table a symlink points at.  This option doesn't exist in MySQL 4.0,
as MySQL 4.0 will not remove symlinks during repair.
<DT><CODE>-p or --parallel-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Uses the same technique as <CODE>-r</CODE> and <CODE>-n</CODE>, but creates
all the keys in parallel, in different threads.
This option was added in MySQL 4.0.2.
<STRONG>This is alpha code. Use at your own risk!</STRONG>
<DT><CODE>-r or --recover</CODE>
<DD>
Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique
(which is an extremely unlikely error with <CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables).
If you want to recover a table, this is the option to try first. Only if
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> reports that the table can't be recovered by <CODE>-r</CODE>, you
should then try <CODE>-o</CODE>.  (Note that in the unlikely case that <CODE>-r</CODE>
fails, the datafile is still intact.)
If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
<CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE>!
<DT><CODE>-o or --safe-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Uses an old recovery method (reads through all rows in order and updates
all index trees based on the found rows); this is an order of magnitude
slower than <CODE>-r</CODE>, but can handle a couple of very unlikely cases that
<CODE>-r</CODE> cannot handle.  This recovery method also uses much less disk
space than <CODE>-r</CODE>. Normally one should always first repair with
<CODE>-r</CODE>, and only if this fails use <CODE>-o</CODE>.

If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>!
<DT><CODE>-n or --sort-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to use sorting to resolve the keys even if the
temporary files should be very big.

<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=...</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are stored.
<DT><CODE>--set-character-set=name</CODE>
<DD>
Change the character set used by the index
<DT><CODE>-t or --tmpdir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path for storing temporary files. If this is not set, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will
use the environment variable <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> for this.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> can be set to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion.
<DT><CODE>-q or --quick</CODE>
<DD>
Faster repair by not modifying the datafile. One can give a second
<CODE>-q</CODE> to force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to modify the original datafile in case
of duplicate keys
<DT><CODE>-u or --unpack</CODE>
<DD>
Unpack file packed with myisampack.

<P>
Other actions that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> can do, besides repair and check tables:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a or --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
Analyse the distribution of keys. This improves join performance by
enabling the join optimiser to better choose in which order it should
join the tables and which keys it should use:
<CODE>myisamchk --describe --verbose table_name'</CODE> or using <CODE>SHOW KEYS</CODE> in
MySQL.
<DT><CODE>-d or --description</CODE>
<DD>
Prints some information about table.
<DT><CODE>-A or --set-auto-increment[=value]</CODE>
<DD>
Force <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> to start at this or higher value. If no value is
given, then sets the next <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value to the highest used value
for the auto key + 1.
<DT><CODE>-S or --sort-index</CODE>
<DD>
Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order.
This will optimise seeks and will make table scanning by key faster.
<DT><CODE>-R or --sort-records=#</CODE>
<DD>
Sorts records according to an index.  This makes your data much more localised
and may speed up ranged <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> operations on
this index. (It may be very slow to do a sort the first time!)
To find out a table's index numbers, use <CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE>, which shows a
table's indexes in the same order that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> sees them.  Indexes are
numbered beginning with 1.
</DL>



<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_memory" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_memory">4.4.6.6  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Memory Usage</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX580"></A>

</P>
<P>
Memory allocation is important when you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> uses no more memory than you specify with the <CODE>-O</CODE>
options.  If you are going to use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on very large files,
you should first decide how much memory you want it to use.  The default
is to use only about 3M to fix things.  By using larger values, you can
get <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to operate faster.  For example, if you have more
than 32M RAM, you could use options such as these (in addition to any
other options you might specify):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk -O sort=16M -O key=16M -O read=1M -O write=1M ...
</PRE>

<P>
Using <CODE>-O sort=16M</CODE> should probably be enough for most cases.

</P>
<P>
Be aware that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> uses temporary files in <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>. If
<CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> points to a memory filesystem, you may easily get out of
memory errors. If this happens, set <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> to point at some directory
with more space and restart <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When repairing, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will also need a lot of disk space:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Double the size of the record file (the original one and a copy).  This
space is not needed if one does a repair with <CODE>--quick</CODE>, as in this
case only the index file will be re-created.  This space is needed on the
same disk as the original record file!
<LI>

Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old
index file is truncated at start, so one usually ignore this space.
This space is needed on the same disk as the original index file!
<LI>

When using <CODE>--recover</CODE> or <CODE>--sort-recover</CODE>
(but not when using <CODE>--safe-recover</CODE>), you will need space for a
sort buffer for:
<CODE>(largest_key + row_pointer_length)*number_of_rows * 2</CODE>.
You can check the length of the keys and the row_pointer_length with
<CODE>myisamchk -dv table</CODE>.
This space is allocated on the temporary disk (specified by <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> or
<CODE>--tmpdir=#</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try to use
<CODE>--safe-recover</CODE> instead of <CODE>--recover</CODE>.

If you run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> (which is the
default on some systems, like Linux), you can't reliably use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
to check a table when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is using the same table.  If you
can be sure that no one is accessing the tables through <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
while you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, you only have to do <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE> before you start checking the tables.  If you can't
guarantee the above, then you must take down <CODE>mysqld</CODE> while you
check the tables.  If you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> while <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is updating
the tables, you may get a warning that a table is corrupt even if it
isn't.

</P>
<P>
If you are not using <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>, you can use
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check tables at any time.  While you do this, all clients
that try to update the table will wait until <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is ready before
continuing.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to repair or optimise tables, you
<STRONG>must</STRONG> always ensure that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is not using
the table (this also applies if you are using <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>).
If you don't take down <CODE>mysqld</CODE> you should at least do a
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> before you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
Your tables <STRONG>may be corrupted</STRONG> if the server and <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
access the tables simultaneously.

This chapter describes how to check for and deal with data corruption
in MySQL databases.  If your tables get corrupted frequently you should
try to find the reason for this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</TABLE>

<P>
Each of these three file types is subject to corruption in various ways, but
problems occur most often in datafiles and index files.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> works by creating a copy of the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> (data) file
row by row. It ends the repair stage by removing the old <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file and renaming the new file to the original file name.  If you use
<CODE>--quick</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> does not create a temporary <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file, but instead assumes that the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file is correct and only
generates a new index file without touching the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file. This
is safe, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> automatically detects if the
<TT>`.MYD'</TT> file is corrupt and aborts the repair in this case.  You can
also give two <CODE>--quick</CODE> options to <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  In this case,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> does not abort on some errors (like duplicate key) but
instead tries to resolve them by modifying the <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file. Normally the use of two <CODE>--quick</CODE> options is useful only if
you have too little free disk space to perform a normal repair.  In this
case you should at least make a backup before running <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

To check a MyISAM table, use the following commands:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>myisamchk tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This finds 99.99% of all errors. What it can't find is corruption that
involves <STRONG>only</STRONG> the datafile (which is very unusual). If you want
to check a table, you should normally run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> without options or
with either the <CODE>-s</CODE> or <CODE>--silent</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -m tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This finds 99.999% of all errors. It checks first all index entries for errors and
then it reads through all rows. It calculates a checksum for all keys in
the rows and verifies that they checksum matches the checksum for the keys
in the index tree.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -e tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This does a complete and thorough check of all data (<CODE>-e</CODE> means
``extended check''). It does a check-read of every key for each row to verify
that they indeed point to the correct row.  This may take a long time on a
big table with many keys.  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will normally stop after the first
error it finds. If you want to obtain more information, you can add the
<CODE>--verbose</CODE> (<CODE>-v</CODE>) option.  This causes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to keep
going, up through a maximum of 20 errors.  In normal usage, a simple
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (with no arguments other than the table name) is sufficient.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -e -i tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Like the previous command, but the <CODE>-i</CODE> option tells <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to
print some informational statistics, too.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX586"></A>
<A NAME="IDX587"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the following section we only talk about using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (extensions <TT>`.MYI'</TT> and <TT>`.MYD'</TT>).  If you
are using <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables (extensions <TT>`.ISM'</TT> and <TT>`.ISD'</TT>),
you should use <CODE>isamchk</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.14, you can repair MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The symptoms of a corrupted table include queries that abort unexpectedly
and observable errors such as these:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<TT>`tbl_name.frm'</TT> is locked against change
<LI>

Can't find file <TT>`tbl_name.MYI'</TT> (Errcode: ###)
<LI>

Unexpected end of file
<LI>

Record file is crashed
<LI>

Got error ### from table handler

To get more information about the error you can run <CODE>perror ###</CODE>. Here
is the most common errors that indicates a problem with the table:


<PRE>
shell&#62; perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
126 = Index file is crashed / Wrong file format
127 = Record-file is crashed
132 = Old database file
134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
135 = No more room in record file
136 = No more room in index file
141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired
</PRE>

Note that error 135 (no more room in record file), is not an error that
can be fixed by a simple repair. In this case you have to do:


<PRE>
ALTER TABLE table MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;
</PRE>

You can also use this technique for error 136 (no more room in index file).

</UL>

<P>
In the other cases, you must repair your tables. <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
can usually detect and fix most things that go wrong.

</P>
<P>
The repair process involves up to four stages, described here. Before you
begin, you should <CODE>cd</CODE> to the database directory and check the
permissions of the table files. Make sure they are readable by the Unix user
that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> runs as (and to you, because you need to access the files
you are checking).  If it turns out you need to modify files, they must also
be writable by you.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL Version 3.23.16 and above, you can (and
should) use the <CODE>CHECK</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> commands to check and repair
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The manual section about table maintenance includes the options to
<CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following section is for the cases where the above command fails or
if you want to use the extended features that <CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> provides.

</P>
<P>
If you are going to repair a table from the command-line, you must first
take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server. Note that when you do
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> on a remote server, the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
will still be alive for a while after <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> returns, until
all queries are stopped and all keys have been flushed to disk.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 1: Checking your tables</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Run <CODE>myisamchk *.MYI</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk -e *.MYI</CODE> if you have
more time.  Use the <CODE>-s</CODE> (silent) option to suppress unnecessary
information.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is done you should use the --update option to tell
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to mark the table as 'checked'.

</P>
<P>
You have to repair only those tables for which <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> announces an
error.  For such tables, proceed to Stage 2.

</P>
<P>
If you get weird errors when checking (such as <CODE>out of
memory</CODE> errors), or if <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> crashes, go to Stage 3.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 2: Easy safe repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Note: If you want repairing to go much faster, you should add: <CODE>-O
sort_buffer=# -O key_buffer=#</CODE> (where # is about 1/4 of the available
memory) to all <CODE>isamchk/myisamchk</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
First, try <CODE>myisamchk -r -q tbl_name</CODE> (<CODE>-r -q</CODE> means ``quick
recovery mode''). This will attempt to repair the index file without
touching the datafile.  If the datafile contains everything that it
should and the delete links point at the correct locations within the
datafile, this should work, and the table is fixed. Start repairing the
next table.  Otherwise, use the following procedure:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make a backup of the datafile before continuing.

<LI>

Use <CODE>myisamchk -r tbl_name</CODE> (<CODE>-r</CODE> means ``recovery mode''). This will
remove incorrect records and deleted records from the datafile and
reconstruct the index file.

<LI>

If the preceding step fails, use <CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover tbl_name</CODE>.
Safe recovery mode uses an old recovery method that handles a few cases that
regular recovery mode doesn't (but is slower).
</OL>

<P>
If you get weird errors when repairing (such as <CODE>out of
memory</CODE> errors), or if <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> crashes, go to Stage 3.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 3: Difficult repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
You should only reach this stage if the first 16K block in the index file is
destroyed or contains incorrect information, or if the index file is
missing.  In this case, it's necessary to create a new index file. Do so as
follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Move the datafile to some safe place.

<LI>

Use the table description file to create new (empty) data and index files:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql db_name
mysql&#62; SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;
mysql&#62; TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
mysql&#62; quit
</PRE>

If your SQL version doesn't have <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE>, use <CODE>DELETE FROM
table_name</CODE> instead.

<LI>

Copy the old datafile back onto the newly created datafile.
(Don't just move the old file back onto the new file; you want to retain
a copy in case something goes wrong.)
</OL>

<P>
Go back to Stage 2.  <CODE>myisamchk -r -q</CODE> should work now.  (This shouldn't
be an endless loop.)

</P>
<P>
As of <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0.2 you can also use <CODE>REPAIR ... USE_FRM</CODE>
which performs the whole procedure automatically.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 4: Very difficult repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
You should reach this stage only if the description file has also
crashed. That should never happen, because the description file isn't changed
after the table is created:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Restore the description file from a backup and go back to Stage 3.  You can
also restore the index file and go back to Stage 2.  In the latter case, you
should start with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.

<LI>

If you don't have a backup but know exactly how the table was created, create
a copy of the table in another database.  Remove the new datafile, then move
the description and index files from the other database to your crashed
database.  This gives you new description and index files, but leaves
the datafile alone.  Go back to Stage 2 and attempt to reconstruct
the index file.
</OL>

To coalesce fragmented records and eliminate wasted space resulting from
deleting or updating records, run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> in recovery mode:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk -r tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can optimise a table in the same way using the SQL <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>
statement.  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> does a repair of the table and a key
analysis, and also sorts the index tree to give faster key lookups.
There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility
and the server, because the server does all the work when you use
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> also has a number of other options you can use to improve
the performance of a table:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>-S</CODE>, <CODE>--sort-index</CODE>

<LI><CODE>-R index_num</CODE>, <CODE>--sort-records=index_num</CODE>

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
repair tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to perform table checks on a regular basis rather than
waiting for problems to occur.  For maintenance purposes, you can use
<CODE>myisamchk -s</CODE> to check tables.  The <CODE>-s</CODE> option (short for
<CODE>--silent</CODE>) causes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to run in silent mode, printing
messages only when errors occur.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX592"></A>
It's also a good idea to check tables when the server starts up.
For example, whenever the machine has done a reboot in the middle of an
update, you usually need to check all the tables that could have been
affected. (This is an ``expected crashed table''.) You could add a test to
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> that runs <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check all tables that have
been modified during the last 24 hours if there is an old <TT>`.pid'</TT>
(process ID) file left after a reboot.  (The <TT>`.pid'</TT> file is created by
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> when it starts up and removed when it terminates normally.  The
presence of a <TT>`.pid'</TT> file at system startup time indicates that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> terminated abnormally.)

</P>
<P>
An even better test would be to check any table whose last-modified time
is more recent than that of the <TT>`.pid'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
You should also check your tables regularly during normal system
operation.  At MySQL AB, we run a <CODE>cron</CODE> job to check all
our important tables once a week, using a line like this in a <TT>`crontab'</TT>
file:

</P>

<PRE>
35 0 * * 0 /path/to/myisamchk --fast --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
This prints out information about crashed tables so we can examine and repair
them when needed.

</P>
<P>
As we haven't had any unexpectedly crashed tables (tables that become
corrupted for reasons other than hardware trouble)
for a couple of years now (this is really true), once a week is
more than enough for us.

</P>
<P>
We recommend that to start with, you execute <CODE>myisamchk -s</CODE> each
night on all tables that have been updated during the last 24 hours,
until you come to trust MySQL as much as we do.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX593"></A>
Normally you don't need to maintain MySQL tables that much.  If
you are changing tables with dynamic size rows (tables with <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns) or have tables with many deleted rows
you may want to from time to time (once a month?) defragment/reclaim space
from the tables.

</P>
<P>
You can do this by using <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> on the tables in question or
if you can take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server for a while do:

</P>

<PRE>
isamchk -r --silent --sort-index -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.ISM
myisamchk -r --silent --sort-index  -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI
</PRE>

To get a description of a table or statistics about it, use the commands shown
here. We explain some of the information in more detail later:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>myisamchk -d tbl_name

Runs <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> in ``describe mode'' to produce a description of
your table. If you start the MySQL server using the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> may report an error
for a table that is updated while it runs.  However, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
doesn't change the table in describe mode, there isn't any risk of
destroying data.

<LI>myisamchk -d -v tbl_name

To produce more information about what <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is doing, add <CODE>-v</CODE>
to tell it to run in verbose mode.

<LI>myisamchk -eis tbl_name

Shows only the most important information from a table. It is slow because it
must read the whole table.

<LI>myisamchk -eiv tbl_name

This is like <CODE>-eis</CODE>, but tells you what is being done.

</PRE>

<P>
Explanations for the types of information <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> produces are
given here.  The ``keyfile'' is the index file.  ``Record'' and ``row''
are synonymous:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>ISAM file

Name of the ISAM (index) file.

<LI>Isam-version

Version of ISAM format. Currently always 2.

<LI>Creation time

When the datafile was created.

<LI>Recover time

When the index/datafile was last reconstructed.

<LI>Data records

How many records are in the table.

<LI>Deleted blocks

How many deleted blocks still have reserved space.
You can optimise your table to minimise this space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

<LI>Data file: Parts

For dynamic record format, this indicates how many data blocks there are. For
an optimised table without fragmented records, this is the same as <CODE>Data
records</CODE>.

<LI>Deleted data

How many bytes of non-reclaimed deleted data there are.
You can optimise your table to minimise this space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

<LI>Data file pointer

The size of the datafile pointer, in bytes. It is usually 2, 3, 4, or 5
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this cannot be controlled
from MySQL yet. For fixed tables, this is a record address. For
dynamic tables, this is a byte address.

<LI>Keyfile pointer

The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 1, 2, or 3
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this is calculated
automatically by MySQL. It is always a block address.

<LI>Max datafile length

How long the table's datafile (<TT>`.MYD'</TT> file) can become, in bytes.

<LI>Max keyfile length

How long the table's key file (<TT>`.MYI'</TT> file) can become, in bytes.

<LI>Recordlength

How much space each record takes, in bytes.

<LI>Record format

The format used to store table rows.
The preceding examples use <CODE>Fixed length</CODE>.
Other possible values are <CODE>Compressed</CODE> and <CODE>Packed</CODE>.

<LI>table description

A list of all keys in the table. For each key, some low-level information
is presented:


<UL>
<LI>Key

This key's number.

<LI>Start

Where in the record this index part starts.

<LI>Len

How long this index part is. For packed numbers, this should always be
the full length of the column. For strings, it may be shorter than the full
length of the indexed column, because you can index a prefix of a string
column.

<LI>Index

<CODE>unique</CODE> or <CODE>multip.</CODE> (multiple). Indicates whether one value
can exist multiple times in this index.

<LI>Type

What data-type this index part has. This is an ISAM data-type
with the options <CODE>packed</CODE>, <CODE>stripped</CODE> or <CODE>empty</CODE>.

<LI>Root

Address of the root index block.

<LI>Blocksize

The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but the value may be
changed at compile time.

<LI>Rec/key

This is a statistical value used by the optimiser. It tells how many
records there are per value for this key. A unique key always has a
value of 1. This may be updated after a table is loaded (or greatly
changed) with <CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE>. If this is not updated at all, a default
value of 30 is given.
</UL>

<LI>

In the first example above, the 9th key is a multi-part key with two parts.

<LI>Keyblocks used

What percentage of the keyblocks are used. Because the table used in the
examples had just been reorganised with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, the values are very
high (very near the theoretical maximum).

<LI>Packed

MySQL tries to pack keys with a common suffix. This can only be used
for <CODE>CHAR</CODE>/<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>/<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> keys. For long strings like
names, this can significantly reduce the space used. In the third example
above, the 4th key is 10 characters long and a 60% reduction in space is
achieved.

<LI>Max levels

How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long keys get high
values.

<LI>Records

How many rows are in the table.

<LI>M.recordlength

The average record length. For tables with fixed-length records, this is the
exact record length.

<LI>Packed

MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The <CODE>Packed</CODE>
value indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing this.

<LI>Recordspace used

What percentage of the datafile is used.

<LI>Empty space

What percentage of the datafile is unused.

<LI>Blocks/Record

Average number of blocks per record (that is, how many links a fragmented
record is composed of). This is always 1.0 for fixed-format tables. This
value should stay as close to 1.0 as possible. If it gets too big, you can
reorganise the table with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

<LI>Recordblocks

How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed format, this is the same as the number
of records.

<LI>Deleteblocks

How many blocks (links) are deleted.

<LI>Recorddata

How many bytes in the datafile are used.

<LI>Deleted data

How many bytes in the datafile are deleted (unused).

<LI>Lost space

If a record is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost. This is
the sum of all such losses, in bytes.

<LI>Linkdata

When the dynamic table format is used, record fragments are linked with
pointers (4 to 7 bytes each). <CODE>Linkdata</CODE> is the sum of the amount of
storage used by all such pointers.
</UL>

<P>
If a table has been compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk
-d</CODE> prints additional information about each table column.  See
section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>, for an example of this
information and a description of what it means.

OPTIMIZE [LOCAL | NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG] TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name]...
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> should be used if you have deleted a large part of a
table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows
(tables that have <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns).
Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations reuse old record positions. You can use <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> to
reclaim the unused space and to defragment the datafile.

</P>
<P>
In most setups you don't have to run <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> at all.  Even
if you do a lot of updates to variable length rows it's not likely that
you need to do this more than once a month/week and only on certain
tables.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> works only on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables. For <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is
currently mapped to <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> to work on other table types by starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> or <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>, but in this
case <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is just mapped to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> works the following way:

<UL>
<LI>

If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.
<LI>

If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.
<LI>

If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn't be done
by sorting the index), update them.
</UL>

<P>
Note that the table is locked during the time <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is
running!

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.1.1, <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> commands are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1 they are written to the binary
log unless the optional <CODE>NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG</CODE> keyword 
(or its alias <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>) was used.

ANALYZE [LOCAL | NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG] TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...]
</PRE>

<P>
Analyse and store the key distribution for the table.  During the
analysis, the table is locked with a read lock.  This works on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.

</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to running <CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses the stored key distribution to decide in which order
tables should be joined when one does a join on something else than a
constant.

</P>
<P>
The command returns a table with the following columns:

</P>

</TABLE>

<P>
You can check the stored key distribution with the <CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Show_database_info">4.5.7.1  Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the table hasn't changed since the last <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> command,
the table will not be analysed again.

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.1.1, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> commands are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1 they are written to the binary

<P>
You should use the <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> command if you want to clear some of the

error message <CODE>Host ... is blocked</CODE>.  When more than
<CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> errors occur in a row for a given host while
connection to the MySQL server, MySQL assumes
something is wrong and blocks the host from further connection requests.
Flushing the host tables allows the host to attempt to connect
again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Blocked_host">A.2.5  <CODE>Host '...' is blocked</CODE> Error</A>. You can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O max_connect_errors=999999999</CODE> to avoid this error message.

When doing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> the kill flag is checked before each block of
rows are read from the original table. If the kill flag was set the command
is aborted and the temporary table is deleted.
<LI>

When doing an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, the kill flag
is checked after each block read and after each updated or deleted
row. If the kill flag is set, the statement is aborted.  Note that if you

<P>
Some comments about the above:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If <CODE>Opened_tables</CODE> is big, then your <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
variable is probably too small.
<LI>

If <CODE>Key_reads</CODE> is big, then your <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> variable is
probably too small.  The <STRONG>cache miss rate</STRONG> can be calculated with
<CODE>Key_reads</CODE>/<CODE>Key_read_requests</CODE>.
<LI>

If <CODE>Handler_read_rnd</CODE> is big, then you probably have a lot of
queries that require MySQL to scan whole tables or you have
joins that don't use keys properly.
<LI>

If <CODE>Threads_created</CODE> is big, you may want to increase the
<CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> variable.  The cache hit rate can be calculated
with <CODE>Threads_created</CODE>/<CODE>Connections</CODE>.
<LI>

If <CODE>Created_tmp_disk_tables</CODE> is big, you may want to increase the
<CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> variable to get the temporary tables memory-based
instead of disk based.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> shows the values of some MySQL system variables.
The options <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> and <CODE>SESSION</CODE> are new in MySQL 4.0.3.
With <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> you will get the variables that will be used for new
connections to MySQL. With <CODE>SESSION</CODE> you will get the values that
are in effect for the current connection. If you are not using either
option, <CODE>SESSION</CODE> is used.

</P>
<P>
If the default values are unsuitable, you can set most of these
variables using command-line options when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>. It is also possible to change most variables
with the <CODE>SET</CODE> statement.

<P>
Each option is described here. Values for buffer sizes, lengths, and stack
sizes are given in bytes.  You can specify values with a suffix of <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`M'</SAMP> to indicate kilobytes or megabytes. For example, <CODE>16M</CODE>
indicates 16 megabytes.  The case of suffix letters does not matter;
<CODE>16M</CODE> and <CODE>16m</CODE> are equivalent:

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX631"></A>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>ansi_mode</CODE>.

Is <CODE>ON</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was started with <CODE>--ansi</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<LI><CODE>back_log</CODE>

The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have. This
comes into play when the main MySQL thread gets <STRONG>very</STRONG>
many connection requests in a very short time. It then takes some time
(although very little) for the main thread to check the connection and start
a new thread. The <CODE>back_log</CODE> value indicates how many requests can be
stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily stops
answering new requests. You need to increase this only if you expect a large
number of connections in a short period of time.

In other words, this value is the size of the listen queue for incoming
TCP/IP connections.  Your operating system has its own limit on the size
of this queue.  The manual page for the Unix <CODE>listen(2)</CODE> system
call should have more details.  Check your OS documentation for the
maximum value for this variable.  Attempting to set <CODE>back_log</CODE>
higher than your operating system limit will be ineffective.

<LI><CODE>basedir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>bdb_cache_size</CODE>

The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.  If you don't use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> to not waste memory for this
cache.

<LI><CODE>bdb_log_buffer_size</CODE>

The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.  If you don't use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should set this to 0 or
start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> to not waste memory for this
cache.

<LI><CODE>bdb_home</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--bdb-home</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>bdb_max_lock</CODE>

The maximum number of locks (10,000 by default) you can have active on a
BDB table. You should increase this if you get errors of type <CODE>bdb:
Lock table is out of available locks</CODE> or <CODE>Got error 12 from ...</CODE>
when you have do long transactions or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has to examine
a lot of rows to calculate the query.

<LI><CODE>bdb_logdir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--bdb-logdir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>bdb_shared_data</CODE>

Is <CODE>ON</CODE> if you are using <CODE>--bdb-shared-data</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>bdb_tmpdir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--bdb-tmpdir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE>.  The size of the cache to hold the SQL

statements for the binary log during a transaction.  If you often use
big, multi-statement transactions you can increase this to get more
performance. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE>, <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI><CODE>bulk_insert_buffer_size</CODE> (was <CODE>myisam_bulk_insert_tree_size</CODE>)

MyISAM uses special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts (that is,
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ...</CODE>, and
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>) faster. This variable limits
the size of the cache tree in bytes per thread. Setting it to 0
will disable this optimisation.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: this cache is only used when adding data to non-empty table.
Default value is 8 MB.

<LI><CODE>character_set</CODE>

The default character set.

<LI><CODE>character_sets</CODE>

The supported character sets.

<LI><CODE>concurrent_inserts</CODE>

If <CODE>ON</CODE> (the default), MySQL will allow you to use <CODE>INSERT</CODE> on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables at the same time as you run <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries
on them.  You can turn this option off by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--safe</CODE> or <CODE>--skip-new</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX632"></A>
<LI><CODE>connect_timeout</CODE>

The number of seconds the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is waiting for a connect
packet before responding with <CODE>Bad handshake</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>datadir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--datadir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>delay_key_write</CODE>

Option for MyISAM tables. Can have one of the following values:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>OFF </TD><TD> All <CODE>CREATE TABLE ... DELAYED_KEY_WRITE</CODE> are ignored.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ON </TD><TD> (default)  MySQL will honor the <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> option
for <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ALL </TD><TD> All new opened tables are treated as if they were created with the <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> option.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

If <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> is enabled this means that the key buffer for
tables with this option will not get flushed on every index update, but
only when a table is closed.  This will speed up writes on keys a lot,
but you should add automatic checking of all tables with <CODE>myisamchk
--fast --force</CODE> if you use this.

<LI><CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE>

After inserting <CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE> rows, the <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> handler will check if there are any <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements
pending. If so, it allows these to execute before continuing.

<LI><CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE>

How long a <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> thread should wait for <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements before terminating.

<LI><CODE>delayed_queue_size</CODE>

What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for handling <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE>.  If the queue becomes full, any client that does <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> will wait until there is room in the queue again.

<LI><CODE>flush</CODE>

This is <CODE>ON</CODE> if you have started MySQL with the <CODE>--flush</CODE>
option.

<LI><CODE>flush_time</CODE>

If this is set to a non-zero value, then every <CODE>flush_time</CODE> seconds all
tables will be closed (to free up resources and sync things to disk). We
only recommend this option on Windows 9x/Me, or on systems where you have
very little resources.

<LI><CODE>ft_boolean_syntax</CODE>

List of operators supported by <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST(... IN BOOLEAN MODE)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A>.

<LI><CODE>ft_min_word_len</CODE>

The minimum length of the word to be included in a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index.
<STRONG>Note: <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.</STRONG> (This option is new for MySQL 4.0.)

<LI><CODE>ft_max_word_len</CODE>

The maximum length of the word to be included in a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index.
<STRONG>Note: <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.</STRONG> (This option is new for MySQL 4.0.)

<LI><CODE>ft_max_word_len_for_sort</CODE>

The maximum length of the word in a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index
to be used in fast index recreation method in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>,
<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>,  or <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.  Longer words are inserted the
slow way.  The rule of the thumb is as follows: with
<CODE>ft_max_word_len_for_sort</CODE> increasing, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> will create bigger
temporary files (thus slowing the process down, due to disk I/O), and will put
fewer keys in one sort block (again, decreasing the efficiency).  When
<CODE>ft_max_word_len_for_sort</CODE> is too small, instead, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> will insert a
lot of words into index the slow way, but short words will be inserted very
quickly.

<LI><CODE>ft_stopword_file</CODE>

The file from which to read the list of stopwords for full-text searches.
All the words from the file will be used; comments are <STRONG>not</STRONG> honored.
By default, built-in list of stopwords is used
(as defined in <TT>`myisam/ft_static.c'</TT>).
Setting this parameter to an empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) will disable
stopword filtering.
<STRONG>Note: <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.</STRONG> (This option is new for MySQL 4.0.10)

<LI><CODE>have_innodb</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports InnoDB tables. <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
if <CODE>--skip-innodb</CODE> is used.
<LI><CODE>have_bdb</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports Berkeley DB tables. <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
if <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> is used.
<LI><CODE>have_raid</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports the <CODE>RAID</CODE> option.
<LI><CODE>have_openssl</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports SSL (encryption) on the client/server
protocol.

<LI><CODE>init_file</CODE>

The name of the file specified with the <CODE>--init-file</CODE> option when
you start the server.  This is a file of SQL statements you want the
server to execute when it starts.

<LI><CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE>

The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an interactive
connection before closing it.  An interactive client is defined as a
client that uses the <CODE>CLIENT_INTERACTIVE</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.  See also <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>join_buffer_size</CODE>

The size of the buffer that is used for full joins (joins that do not
use indexes).  The buffer is allocated one time for each full join
between two tables. Increase this value to get a faster full join when
adding indexes is not possible. (Normally the best way to get fast joins
is to add indexes.)

<A NAME="IDX633"></A>
<LI><CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>

Index blocks are buffered and are shared by all threads.
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> is the size of the buffer used for index blocks.

Increase this to get better index handling (for all reads and multiple
writes) to as much as you can afford; 64M on a 256M machine that mainly
runs MySQL is quite common.  If you, however, make this too big
(for instance more than 50% of your total memory) your system may start
to page and become extremely slow. Remember that because MySQL does not
cache data reads, you will have to leave some room for the OS
filesystem cache.

You can check the performance of the key buffer by doing <CODE>SHOW
STATUS</CODE> and examine the variables <CODE>Key_read_requests</CODE>,
<CODE>Key_reads</CODE>, <CODE>Key_write_requests</CODE>, and <CODE>Key_writes</CODE>.  The
<CODE>Key_reads/Key_read_request</CODE> ratio should normally be &#60; 0.01.
The <CODE>Key_write/Key_write_requests</CODE> is usually near 1 if you are
using mostly updates/deletes but may be much smaller if you tend to
do updates that affect many at the same time or if you are
using <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.7  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To get even more speed when writing many rows at the same time, use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOCK_TABLES">6.7.5  <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> and <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI><CODE>language</CODE>

The language used for error messages.

<LI><CODE>large_file_support</CODE>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was compiled with options for big file support.

<LI><CODE>locked_in_memory</CODE>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was locked in memory with <CODE>--memlock</CODE>

<LI><CODE>log</CODE>

If logging of all queries is enabled.

<LI><CODE>log_update</CODE>

If the update log is enabled.

<LI><CODE>log_bin</CODE>

If the binary log is enabled.

<LI><CODE>log_slave_updates</CODE>

If the updates from the slave should be logged.

<LI><CODE>long_query_time</CODE>

If a query takes longer than this (in seconds), the <CODE>Slow_queries</CODE> counter
will be incremented. If you are using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, the query
will be logged to the slow query logfile. This value is measured in real
time, not CPU time, so a query that may be under the threshold on a lightly
loaded system may be above the threshold on a heavily loaded one.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<LI><CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE>

If set to 1 table names are stored in lowercase on disk and table
name comparisons will be case-insensitive.
From version 4.0.2, this option also applies to database names.
From 4.1.1 this option also applies to table alias.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<LI><CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>

The maximum size of one packet. The message buffer is initialised to
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> bytes, but can grow up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>
bytes when needed.  This value by default is small, to catch big (possibly
wrong) packets.  You must increase this value if you are using big
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns. It should be as big as the biggest <CODE>BLOB</CODE> you want
to use.  The protocol limits for <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is 16M in MySQL
3.23 and 1G in MySQL 4.0.

<LI><CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE>

If a multi-statement transaction requires more than this amount of memory,
one will get the error "Multi-statement transaction required more than
'max_binlog_cache_size' bytes of storage".

<LI><CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>

Available after 3.23.33. If a write to the binary (replication) log exceeds
the given value, rotate the logs. You cannot set it to less than 4096
bytes (1024 in MySQL versions older than 4.0.14),
or more than 1 GB. Default is 1 GB. Note if you are using
transactions: a transaction is written in one chunk to the binary log,
hence it is never split between several binary logs. Therefore, if you
have big transactions, you may see binlogs bigger than
<CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>. If <CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE> (available
starting from MySQL 4.0.14) is 0, then <CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE> will
apply to relay logs as well.

<LI><CODE>max_connections</CODE>

The number of simultaneous clients allowed. Increasing this value increases
the number of file descriptors that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> requires.  See below for
comments on file descriptor limits. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Too_many_connections">A.2.6  <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> Error</A>.

<LI><CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE>

If there is more than this number of interrupted connections from a host
this host will be blocked from further connections.  You can unblock a host
with the command <CODE>FLUSH HOSTS</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>max_delayed_threads</CODE>

Don't start more than this number of threads to handle <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
statements.  If you try to insert data into a new table after all <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> threads are in use, the row will be inserted as if the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> attribute wasn't specified. If you set this to 0, MySQL
will never create a max_delayed thread.

<LI><CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE>

Don't allow creation of heap tables bigger than this.

<LI><CODE>max_join_size</CODE>

Joins that are probably going to read more than <CODE>max_join_size</CODE>
records return an error. Set this value if your users tend to perform joins
that lack a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, that take a long time, and that return
millions of rows.

<LI><CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE>

Available starting from 4.0.14. If a write to the relay log (a kind of
log used by replication slaves, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Implementation_Details">4.10.3  Replication Implementation Details</A>) exceeds the given value, rotate the relay log.
This variable enables you to put different size constraints on relay
logs and binary logs.
However, setting the variable to 0 will make MySQL use 
<CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE> for both binary logs and relay logs.
You have to set <CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE> to 0 or more than 4096,
and less than 1 GB. Default is 0.

<LI><CODE>max_seeks_for_key</CODE>

Limit assumed max number of seeks when looking up rows based on a key.
The MySQL optimiser will assume that when searching after matching rows
in a table through scanning a key, we will not cause more than this
number of key seeks independent of the cardinality of the key.  By setting
this to a low value (100 ?) you can force MySQL to prefer keys instead
of table scans.

<LI><CODE>max_sort_length</CODE>

The number of bytes to use when sorting <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>
values (only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes of each value
are used; the rest are ignored).

<LI><CODE>max_user_connections</CODE>

The maximum number of active connections for a single user (0 = no limit).

<LI><CODE>max_tmp_tables</CODE>

(This option doesn't yet do anything.)
Maximum number of temporary tables a client can keep open at the same time.

<LI><CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE>

After this many write locks, allow some read locks to run in between.

<LI><CODE>myisam_recover_options</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>myisam_sort_buffer_size</CODE>

The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when doing a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or when creating indexes with <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> or
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE>.

If the temporary file used for fast index creation would be bigger than
using the key cache by the amount specified here, then prefer the key
cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in large
tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this parameter is given in megabytes before 4.0.3 and
in bytes beginning with this version.

<LI><CODE>myisam_repair_threads</CODE>.

If this value is greater than one, MyISAM table indexes during
<CODE>Repair by sorting</CODE> process will be created in parallel -
each index in its own thread. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> multi-threaded repair
is still <STRONG>alpha</STRONG> quality code.

<LI><CODE>myisam_max_sort_file_size</CODE>

The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use
while recreating the index (during <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.  If the file-size would be bigger than this,
the index will be created through the key cache (which is slower).
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this parameter is given in megabytes before 4.0.3 and
in bytes beginning with this version.

<LI><CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>

The communication buffer is reset to this size between queries. This
should not normally be changed, but if you have very little memory, you
can set it to the expected size of a query.  (That is, the expected length of
SQL statements sent by clients.  If statements exceed this length, the buffer
is automatically enlarged, up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.)

<LI><CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE>

Number of seconds to wait for more data from a connection before aborting
the read.  Note that when we don't expect data from a connection, the timeout
is defined by <CODE>write_timeout</CODE>. See also <CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>net_retry_count</CODE>

If a read on a communication port is interrupted, retry this many times
before giving up.  This value should be quite high on <CODE>FreeBSD</CODE> as
internal interrupts are sent to all threads.

<LI><CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE>

Number of seconds to wait for a block to be written to a connection before
aborting the write.

<LI><CODE>open_files_limit</CODE>

Number of files the system allows mysqld to open.  This is the real
value given for the system and may be different from the value you
gave mysqld as a startup parameter.  This is 0 on systems where MySQL
can't change the number of open files.

<LI><CODE>pid_file</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--pid-file</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>port</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--port</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>protocol_version</CODE>

The protocol version used by the MySQL server.

<LI><CODE>range_alloc_block_size</CODE>

Size of blocks that are allocated when doing range optimization.

<LI><CODE>read_buffer_size</CODE> (was <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>)

Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a buffer of this
size for each table it scans. If you do many sequential scans, you may
want to increase this value.

<LI><CODE>read_rnd_buffer_size</CODE> (was <CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE>)

When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows are read
through this buffer to avoid a disk seeks.  Can improve <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
by a lot if set to a high value.  As this is a thread-specific variable,
one should not set this big globally, but just change this when running
some specific big queries.

<LI><CODE>query_alloc_block_size</CODE>

Size of memory allocation blocks that are allocated for objects
created during query parsing and execution. If you have problem with
memory fragmentation it may help increasing this a bit.

<LI><CODE>query_cache_limit</CODE>

Don't cache results that are bigger than this. (Default 1M).

<LI><CODE>query_cache_size</CODE>

The memory allocated to store results from old queries.
If this is 0, the query cache is disabled (default).

<LI><CODE>query_cache_type</CODE>

This may be set (only numeric) to
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Alias</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Comment</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>0 </TD><TD> OFF </TD><TD> Don't cache or retrieve results.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 </TD><TD> ON </TD><TD> Cache all results except <CODE>SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE ...</CODE> queries.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2 </TD><TD> DEMAND </TD><TD> Cache only <CODE>SELECT SQL_CACHE ...</CODE> queries.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI><CODE>query_prealloc_size</CODE>

Persistent buffer for query parsing and execution.  This one is not
freed between queries.  In theory, by making this ``big enough'',
make MySQL run queries without having to do a single <CODE>malloc()</CODE> call.

<LI><CODE>safe_show_database</CODE>

Don't show databases for which the user doesn't have any database or
table privileges. This can improve security if you're concerned about
people being able to see what databases other users have. See also
<CODE>skip_show_database</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>server_id</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--server-id</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>skip_locking</CODE>

Is OFF if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses external locking.

<LI><CODE>skip_networking</CODE>

Is ON if we only allow local (socket) connections.

<LI><CODE>skip_show_database</CODE>

This prevents people from doing <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> if they don't have
the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege. This can improve security if you're
concerned about people being able to see what databases other users
have. See also <CODE>safe_show_database</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE>

Number of seconds to wait for more data from a master/slave connection
before aborting the read.

<LI><CODE>slow_launch_time</CODE>

If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in seconds), the
<CODE>Slow_launch_threads</CODE> counter will be incremented.

<LI><CODE>socket</CODE>

The Unix socket used by the server.

<LI><CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE>

Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this
size. Increase this value for faster <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
operations.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A>.

<LI><CODE>table_cache</CODE>

The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
increases the number of file descriptors that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> requires.
You can check if you need to increase the table cache by checking the
<CODE>Opened_tables</CODE> variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.7.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.
If this variable
is big and you don't do <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> a lot (which just forces all
tables to be closed and reopenend), then you should increase the value of this
variable.

For more information about the table cache, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.7  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.

<LI><CODE>table_type</CODE>

The default table type.

<LI><CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE>

How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse.  When a
client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there
aren't more than <CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> threads from before.  All new
threads are first taken from the cache, and only when the cache is empty
is a new thread created.  This variable can be increased to improve
performance if you have a lot of new connections. (Normally this doesn't
give a notable performance improvement if you have a good
thread implementation.)  By examing the difference between
the <CODE>Connections</CODE> and <CODE>Threads_created</CODE> status variables 
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.7.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A> for details) you can see how efficient  
thread cache is.

<LI><CODE>thread_concurrency</CODE>

On Solaris, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will call <CODE>thr_setconcurrency()</CODE> with
this value.  <CODE>thr_setconcurrency()</CODE> permits the application to give
the threads system a hint for the desired number of threads that should
be run at the same time.

<LI><CODE>thread_stack</CODE>

The stack size for each thread.  Many of the limits detected by the
<CODE>crash-me</CODE> test are dependent on this value. The default is
large enough for normal operation.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<LI><CODE>timezone</CODE>

The timezone for the server.

<LI><CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>

If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, MySQL
will automatically convert it to an on-disk <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
Increase the value of <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> if you do many advanced
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries and you have lots of memory.

<LI><CODE>tmpdir</CODE>

The directory used for temporary files and temporary tables.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, it can be set to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion. This feature can be used to
spread load between several physical disks.
It is possible to set <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to point to a memory-based filesystem,
except if the MySQL server is a slave. If it is a slave, it needs some
of its temporary files (for replication of temporary tables or of
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>) to survive a machine's reboot, so a
memory-based <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> which is cleared when the machine reboots is not
suitable; a disk-based <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> is necessary.

<LI><CODE>transaction_alloc_block_size</CODE>

Size of memory allocation blocks that are allocated for storing queries
that are part of a transaction that are to be stored in the binary log
when doing a commit.

<LI><CODE>transaction_prealloc_block_size</CODE>

Persistent buffer for <CODE>transaction_alloc_blocks</CODE>. that are not
freed between queries. By making this ``big enough'' to fit all queries in
a common transaction you can avoid a lot of <CODE>malloc()</CODE> calls.

<LI><CODE>version</CODE>

The version number for the server.

<LI><CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>

The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a not interactive
connection before closing it.

On thread startup <CODE>SESSION.WAIT_TIMEOUT</CODE> is initialised from
<CODE>GLOBAL.WAIT_TIMEOUT</CODE> or <CODE>GLOBAL.INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT</CODE> depending
on the type of client (as defined by the <CODE>CLIENT_INTERACTIVE</CODE> connect
option). See also <CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE>.

<UL>
<LI><CODE>Checking table</CODE>

The thread is performing [automatic] checking of the table.
<LI><CODE>Closing tables</CODE>

Means that the thread is flushing the changed table data to disk and
closing the used tables. This should be a fast operation.  If not, then
you should check that you don't have a full disk or that the disk is not
in very heavy use.
<LI><CODE>Connect Out</CODE>

Slave connecting to master.
<LI><CODE>Copying to tmp table on disk</CODE>

The temporary result set was larger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> and the
thread is now changing the in memory-based temporary table to a disk
based one to save memory.
<LI><CODE>Creating tmp table</CODE>

The thread is creating a temporary table to hold a part of the result for
the query.
<LI><CODE>deleting from main table</CODE>

When executing the first part of a multi-table delete and we are only
deleting from the first table.
<LI><CODE>deleting from reference tables</CODE>

When executing the second part of a multi-table delete and we are deleting
the matched rows from the other tables.
<LI><CODE>Flushing tables</CODE>

The thread is executing <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> and is waiting for all
threads to close their tables.
<LI><CODE>Killed</CODE>

Someone has sent a kill to the thread and it should abort next time it
checks the kill flag.  The flag is checked in each major loop in MySQL,
but in some cases it may still take a short time for the thread to die.
If the thread is locked by some other thread, the kill will take effect
as soon as the other thread releases its lock.
<LI><CODE>Sending data</CODE>

The thread is processing rows for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement and is
also sending data to the client.
<LI><CODE>Sorting for group</CODE>

The thread is doing a sort to satisfy a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Sorting for order</CODE>

The thread is doing a sort to satisfy a <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Opening tables</CODE>

This simply means that the thread is trying to open a table. This is
should be very fast procedure, unless something prevents opening. For
example an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or a <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> can prevent opening
a table until the command is finished.
<LI><CODE>Removing duplicates</CODE>

The query was using <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> in such a way that MySQL
couldn't optimise that distinct away at an early stage. Because of this
MySQL has to do an extra stage to remove all duplicated rows before
sending the result to the client.
<LI><CODE>Reopen table</CODE>

The thread got a lock for the table, but noticed after getting the lock
that the underlying table structure changed. It has freed the lock,
closed the table and is now trying to reopen it.
<LI><CODE>Repair by sorting</CODE>

The repair code is using sorting to create indexes.
<LI><CODE>Repair with keycache</CODE>

The repair code is using creating keys one by one through the key cache.
This is much slower than <CODE>Repair by sorting</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Searching rows for update</CODE>

The thread is doing a first phase to find all matching rows before
updating them.  This has to be done if the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> is changing
the index that is used to find the involved rows.
<LI><CODE>Sleeping</CODE>

The thread is wating for the client to send a new command to it.
<LI><CODE>System lock</CODE>

The thread is waiting for getting to get a external system lock for the
table. If you are not using multiple mysqld servers that are accessing
the same tables, you can disable system locks with the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option.
<LI><CODE>Upgrading lock</CODE>

The <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> handler is trying to get a lock for the table
to insert rows.
<LI><CODE>Updating</CODE>

The thread is searching for rows to update and updating them.
<LI><CODE>User Lock</CODE>

The thread is waiting on a <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Waiting for tables</CODE>

The thread got a notification that the underlying structure for a table
has changed and it needs to reopen the table to get the new structure.
To be able to reopen the table it must however wait until all other
threads have closed the table in question.

This notification happens if another thread has used <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>
or one of the following commands on the table in question: <CODE>FLUSH
TABLES table_name</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>waiting for handler insert</CODE>

The <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> handler has processed all inserts and are
waiting to get new ones.

<P>
It shows the errors, warnings and notes that one got for the last command.
The errors/warnings are reset for each new command that uses a table.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server sends back the total number of warnings and errors you
got for the last commend; This can be retrieved by calling
<CODE>mysql_warning_count()</CODE>.

<P>
Maximum number of warnings can be specified using the server variable
<CODE>'max_error_count'</CODE>, <CODE>SET max_error_count=[count]</CODE>; By default
it is 64. In case to disable warnings, simply reset this variable to
'0'. In case if <CODE>max_error_count</CODE> is 0, then still the warning
count represents how many warnings have occurred, but none of the messages
are stored.

</P>
<P>
For example, consider the following <CODE>ALTER</CODE> table statement for the
above example, which returns only one warning message even though total
warnings occurred is 3 when you set max_error_count=1.

<H3><A NAME="Character_sets" HREF="manual_toc.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX646"></A>
<A NAME="IDX647"></A>
<A NAME="IDX648"></A>

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set
with sorting according to Swedish/Finnish. This is the character set suitable
in the USA and western Europe.

</P>
<P>
All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
<CODE>--with-extra-charsets=complex</CODE>.  This will add code to all
standard programs to be able to handle <CODE>latin1</CODE> and all multi-byte
character sets within the binary. Other character sets will be
loaded from a character-set definition file when needed.

</P>
<P>
The character set determines what characters are allowed in names and how
things are sorted by the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clauses of
the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
You can change the character set with the <CODE>--default-character-set</CODE>
option when you start the server.  The character sets available depend
on the <CODE>--with-charset=charset</CODE> and <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=
list-of-charset | complex | all | none</CODE> options to <CODE>configure</CODE>, and the
character set configuration files listed in
<TT>`SHAREDIR/charsets/Index'</TT>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you change the character set when running MySQL (which may
also change the sort order), you must run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q
--set-character-set=charset</CODE> on all
tables. Otherwise, your indexes may not be ordered correctly.

</P>
<P>
When a client connects to a MySQL server, the server sends the
default character set in use to the client.  The client will switch to
use this character set for this connection.

</P>
<P>
One should use <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> when escaping strings
for an SQL query.  <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> is identical to the
old <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> function, except that it takes the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
connection handle as the first parameter.

</P>
<P>
If the client is compiled with different paths than where the server is
installed and the user who configured MySQL didn't include all
character sets in the MySQL binary, one must specify for
the client where it can find the additional character sets it will need
if the server runs with a different character set than the client.

</P>
<P>
One can specify this by putting in a MySQL option file:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
character-sets-dir=/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets
</PRE>

<P>
where the path points to the directory in which the dynamic MySQL character
sets are stored.

</P>
<P>
One can force the client to use specific character set by specifying:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
default-character-set=character-set-name
</PRE>

<P>
but normally this is never needed.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="German_character_set" HREF="manual_toc.html#German_character_set">4.6.1.1  German character set</A></H4>

<P>
To get German sorting order, you should start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--default-character-set=latin1_de</CODE>.  This will give you the following
characteristics.

</P>
<P>
When sorting and comparing strings, the following mapping is done on the
strings before doing the comparison:

</P>

<PRE>
@"a  -&#62;  ae
@"o  -&#62;  oe
@"u  -&#62;  ue
@ss{}  -&#62;  ss
</PRE>

<P>
All accented characters, are converted to their un-accented uppercase
counterpart.  All letters are converted to uppercase.

</P>
<P>
When comparing strings with <CODE>LIKE</CODE> the one -&#62; two character mapping
is not done. All letters are converted to uppercase. Accent are removed
from all letters except: <CODE>@"U</CODE>, <CODE>@"u</CODE>, <CODE>@"O</CODE>, <CODE>@"o</CODE>,
<CODE>@"A</CODE> and <CODE>@"a</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX650"></A>
<A NAME="IDX651"></A>
<A NAME="IDX652"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> can issue error messages in the following languages:
Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (the default), Estonian, French, German, Greek,
Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Norwegian-ny, Polish,
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish.

</P>
<P>
To start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a particular language, use either the
<CODE>--language=lang</CODE> or <CODE>-L lang</CODE> options. For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --language=swedish
</PRE>

<P>
or:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --language=/usr/local/share/swedish
</PRE>

<P>
Note that all language names are specified in lowercase.

</P>
<P>
The language files are located (by default) in
<TT>`<VAR>mysql_base_dir</VAR>/share/<VAR>LANGUAGE</VAR>/'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
To update the error message file, you should edit the <TT>`errmsg.txt'</TT> file
and execute the following command to generate the <TT>`errmsg.sys'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; comp_err errmsg.txt errmsg.sys
</PRE>

<P>
If you upgrade to a newer version of MySQL, remember to repeat
your changes with the new <TT>`errmsg.txt'</TT> file.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Adding_character_set" HREF="manual_toc.html#Adding_character_set">4.6.3  Adding a New Character Set</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX653"></A>
<A NAME="IDX654"></A>

</P>
<P>
To add another character set to MySQL, use the following procedure.

</P>
<P>
Decide if the set is simple or complex.  If the character set
does not need to use special string collating routines for
sorting and does not need multi-byte character support, it is
simple.  If it needs either of those features, it is complex.

</P>
<P>
For example, <CODE>latin1</CODE> and <CODE>danish</CODE> are simple charactersets while
<CODE>big5</CODE> or <CODE>czech</CODE> are complex character sets.

</P>
<P>
In the following section, we have assumed that you name your character
set <CODE>MYSET</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For a simple character set do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Add MYSET to the end of the <TT>`sql/share/charsets/Index'</TT> file
Assign a unique number to it.

<LI>

Create the file <TT>`sql/share/charsets/MYSET.conf'</TT>.
(You can use <TT>`sql/share/charsets/latin1.conf'</TT> as a base for this.)

The syntax for the file is very simple:


<UL>
<LI>

Comments start with a '#' character and proceed to the end of the line.
<LI>

Words are separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.
<LI>

When defining the character set, every word must be a number in hexadecimal
format
<LI>

The <CODE>ctype</CODE> array takes up the first 257 words. The
<CODE>to_lower[]</CODE>, <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> and <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> arrays take up
256 words each after that.
</UL>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The Character Definition Arrays</A>.

<LI>

Add the character set name to the <CODE>CHARSETS_AVAILABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>COMPILED_CHARSETS</CODE> lists in <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.

<LI>

Reconfigure, recompile, and test.

</OL>

<P>
For a complex character set do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Create the file <TT>`strings/ctype-MYSET.c'</TT> in the MySQL source
distribution.

<LI>

Add MYSET to the end of the <TT>`sql/share/charsets/Index'</TT> file.
Assign a unique number to it.

<LI>

Look at one of the existing <TT>`ctype-*.c'</TT> files to see what needs to
be defined, for example <TT>`strings/ctype-big5.c'</TT>. Note that the
arrays in your file must have names like <CODE>ctype_MYSET</CODE>,
<CODE>to_lower_MYSET</CODE>, and so on.  This corresponds to the arrays
in the simple character set. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The Character Definition Arrays</A>.

<LI>

Near the top of the file, place a special comment like this:


<PRE>
/*
 * This comment is parsed by configure to create ctype.c,
 * so don't change it unless you know what you are doing.
 *
 * .configure. number_MYSET=MYNUMBER
 * .configure. strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N
 * .configure. mbmaxlen_MYSET=N
 */
</PRE>

The <CODE>configure</CODE> program uses this comment to include
the character set into the MySQL library automatically.

The strxfrm_multiply and mbmaxlen lines will be explained in
the following sections.  Only include these if you need the string
collating functions or the multi-byte character set functions,
respectively.

<LI>

You should then create some of the following functions:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>my_strncoll_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_strcoll_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_strxfrm_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_like_range_MYSET()</CODE>

</UL>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_collating">4.6.5  String Collating Support</A>.

<LI>

Add the character set name to the <CODE>CHARSETS_AVAILABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>COMPILED_CHARSETS</CODE> lists in <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.

<LI>

Reconfigure, recompile, and test.
</OL>

<P>
The file <TT>`sql/share/charsets/README'</TT> includes some more instructions.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have the character set included in the MySQL
distribution, mail a patch to the MySQL internals mailing list.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Character_arrays" HREF="manual_toc.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The Character Definition Arrays</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>to_lower[]</CODE> and <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> are simple arrays that hold the
lowercase and uppercase characters corresponding to each member of the
character set.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
to_lower['A'] should contain 'a'
to_upper['a'] should contain 'A'
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> is a map indicating how characters should be ordered for
comparison and sorting purposes. Quite often (but not for all character sets)
this is the same as <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> (which means sorting will be
case-insensitive). MySQL will sort characters based on the value of
<CODE>sort_order[character]</CODE>.  For more complicated sorting rules, see
the discussion of string collating below. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_collating">4.6.5  String Collating Support</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ctype[]</CODE> is an array of bit values, with one element for one character.
(Note that <CODE>to_lower[]</CODE>, <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE>, and <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE>
are indexed by character value, but <CODE>ctype[]</CODE> is indexed by character
value + 1.  This is an old legacy to be able to handle <CODE>EOF</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
You can find the following bitmask definitions in <TT>`m_ctype.h'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
#define _U      01      /* Uppercase */
#define _L      02      /* Lowercase */
#define _N      04      /* Numeral (digit) */
#define _S      010     /* Spacing character */
#define _P      020     /* Punctuation */
#define _C      040     /* Control character */
#define _B      0100    /* Blank */
#define _X      0200    /* heXadecimal digit */
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>ctype[]</CODE> entry for each character should be the union of the
applicable bitmask values that describe the character.  For example,
<CODE>'A'</CODE> is an uppercase character (<CODE>_U</CODE>) as well as a
hexadecimal digit (<CODE>_X</CODE>), so <CODE>ctype['A'+1]</CODE> should contain the
value:

</P>

<PRE>
_U + _X = 01 + 0200 = 0201

<P>
If the sorting rules for your language are too complex to be handled
with the simple <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> table, you need to use the string
collating functions.

</P>
<P>

<CODE>sjis</CODE>, and <CODE>tis160</CODE> character sets for examples.

</P>
<P>
You must specify the <CODE>strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N</CODE> value in the
special comment at the top of the file.  <CODE>N</CODE> should be set to
the maximum ratio the strings may grow during <CODE>my_strxfrm_MYSET</CODE> (it
must be a positive integer).

<H3><A NAME="Problems_with_character_sets" HREF="manual_toc.html#Problems_with_character_sets">4.6.7  Problems With Character Sets</A></H3>

<P>
If you try to use a character set that is not compiled into your binary,
you can run into a couple of different problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Your program has a wrong path to where the character sets are stored.
(Default <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets'</TT>).
This can be fixed by using the <CODE>--character-sets-dir</CODE>
option to the program in question.
<LI>

The character set is a multi-byte character set that can't be loaded
dynamically.  In this case you have to recompile the program with the
support for the character set.
<LI>

The character set is a dynamic character set, but you don't have a
configure file for it.  In this case you should install the configure
file for the character set from a new MySQL distribution.
<LI>

Your <TT>`Index'</TT> file doesn't contain the name for the character set.


<PRE>
ERROR 1105: File '/usr/local/share/mysql/charsets/?.conf' not found
(Errcode: 2)
</PRE>

In this case you should either get a new <CODE>Index</CODE> file or add
by hand the name of any missing character sets.
</UL>

<P>
For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, you can check the character set name and number for a
table with <CODE>myisamchk -dvv table_name</CODE>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
 
Utility to describe, check, optimise, and repair MySQL tables.
Because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> has many functions, it is described in its own
chapter. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<A NAME="IDX662"></A>
<DT><CODE>make_binary_distribution</CODE>
<DD>
Makes a binary release of a compiled MySQL. This could be sent
by FTP to <TT>`/pub/mysql/Incoming'</TT> on <CODE>support.mysql.com</CODE> for the
convenience of other MySQL users.

<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>
<DD>
The MySQL bug report script.  This script should always be used when
filing a bug report to the MySQL list.

<A NAME="IDX664"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<DD>
The SQL daemon. This should always be running.

<A NAME="IDX665"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
<DD>
Creates the MySQL grant tables with default privileges. This is
usually executed only once, when first installing MySQL
on a system.

<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> is the recommended way to start a <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
daemon on Unix.  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> adds some safety features such as
restarting the server when an error occurs and logging run-time
information to a log file.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG>
Before MySQL 4.0, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> is named <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
To preserve backward compatibility, MySQL binary distributions for
some time will include <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as a symbolic link to
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you don't use <CODE>--mysqld=#</CODE> or <CODE>--mysqld-version=#</CODE>
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will use an executable named <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> if it
exists. If not, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will start <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
This makes it very easy to test to use <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> instead of
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>; just copy <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> to where you have
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> and it will be used.

</P>
<P>
Normally one should never edit the <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script, but
instead put the options to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> in the
<CODE>[mysqld_safe]</CODE> section in the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file. <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> reads all options from the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE>,
<CODE>[server]</CODE> and <CODE>[mysqld_safe]</CODE> sections from the option files.
(For backward compatibility, it also reads the
<CODE>[safe_mysqld]</CODE> sections.)
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that all options on the command-line to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> are passed
to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  If you wants to use any options in <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't support, you must specify these in the option file.

</P>
<P>
Most of the options to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> are the same as the options to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--basedir=path</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--core-file-size=#</CODE>
<DD>
Size of the core file <CODE>mysqld</CODE> should be able to create. Passed to <CODE>ulimit -c</CODE>.

<DD>
Write the error log to the above file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.
<DT><CODE>--ledir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<DT><CODE>--log=path</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--mysqld=mysqld-version</CODE>
<DD>
Name of the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version in the <CODE>ledir</CODE> directory you want to start.
<DT><CODE>--mysqld-version=version</CODE>
<DD>
Similar to <CODE>--mysqld=</CODE> but here you only give the suffix for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
For example if you use <CODE>--mysqld-version=max</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will
start the <CODE>ledir/mysqld-max</CODE> version.  If the argument to
<CODE>--mysqld-version</CODE> is empty, <CODE>ledir/mysqld</CODE> will be used.
<DT><CODE>--nice=# (added in MySQL 4.0.14)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--no-defaults</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE>

</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script is written so that it normally is able to start
a server that was installed from either a source or a binary version of
MySQL, even if these install the server in slightly different
locations.  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> expects one of these conditions to be true:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The server and databases can be found relative to the directory from which
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> is invoked.  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> looks under its working
directory for <TT>`bin'</TT> and <TT>`data'</TT> directories (for binary
distributions) or for <TT>`libexec'</TT> and <TT>`var'</TT> directories (for source
distributions).  This condition should be met if you execute
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> from your MySQL installation directory (for
example, <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> for a binary distribution).

<LI>

If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the working directory,
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> attempts to locate them by absolute pathnames.  Typical
locations are <TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT> and <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>.
The actual locations are determined when the distribution was built from which
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> comes.  They should be correct if
MySQL was installed in a standard location.
</UL>

<P>
Because <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will try to find the server and databases relative
to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of
MySQL anywhere, as long as you start <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> from the
MySQL installation directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; bin/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> fails, even when invoked from the MySQL
installation directory, you can modify it to use the path to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
and the pathname options that are correct for your system.  Note that if you
upgrade MySQL in the future, your modified version of
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will be overwritten, so you should make a copy of your
edited version that you can reinstall.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="mysqld_multi" HREF="manual_toc.html#mysqld_multi">4.7.3  <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>, A Program for Managing Multiple MySQL Servers</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX672"></A>
<A NAME="IDX673"></A>
<A NAME="IDX674"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> is meant for managing several <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
processes that listen for connections on different Unix sockets and
TCP/IP ports.

</P>
<P>
The program will search for group(s) named <CODE>[mysqld#]</CODE> from
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> (or the file named by the <CODE>--config-file=...</CODE> option),
where <CODE>#</CODE> can be any positive number starting from 1.  This number
is referred to in the following discussion as the option group number,
or GNR.  Group numbers distinquish option groups from one another and are
used as arguments to <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> to specify which servers you want
to start, stop, or obtain status for.  Options listed in these groups
should be the same as you would use in the usual <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE>
group used for starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  (See, for example, section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.)  However, for <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>, be sure that each group
includes options for values such as the port, socket, etc., to be used
for each individual <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> is invoked using the following syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
Usage: mysqld_multi [OPTIONS] {start|stop|report} [GNR,GNR,GNR...]
or     mysqld_multi [OPTIONS] {start|stop|report} [GNR-GNR,GNR,GNR-GNR,...]
</PRE>

<P>
Each
GNR represents an option group number. You can start, stop or report
any GNR, or several of them at the same time. For an example of how you
might set up an option file, use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_multi --example
</PRE>

<P>
The GNR values in the list can be comma-separated or combined with a dash;
in the latter case, all the GNRs between GNR1-GNR2 will be affected. With
no GNR argument, all groups listed in the option file will be either
started, stopped, or reported. Note that you must not have any white
spaces in the GNR list. Anything after a white space is ignored.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--config-file=...</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX675"></A>
 
Alternative config file. Note: This will not affect this program's own
options (group <CODE>[mysqld_multi]</CODE>), but only groups
<CODE>[mysqld#]</CODE>. Without this option, everything will be searched from the
ordinary <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file.
<A NAME="IDX676"></A>
<DT><CODE>--example</CODE>
<DD>
Display an example option file.
<A NAME="IDX677"></A>
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Print this help and exit.
<A NAME="IDX678"></A>
<DT><CODE>--log=...</CODE>
<DD>
Log file. Full path to and the name for the log file. Note: If the file
exists, everything will be appended.
<A NAME="IDX679"></A>
<DT><CODE>--mysqladmin=...</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> binary to be used for a server shutdown.
<A NAME="IDX680"></A>
<DT><CODE>--mysqld=...</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary to be used. Note that you can give
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> to this option also. The options are passed to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. Just make sure you have <CODE>mysqld</CODE> in your environment
variable <CODE>PATH</CODE> or fix <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX681"></A>
<DT><CODE>--no-log</CODE>
<DD>
Print to stdout instead of the log file. By default the log file is
turned on.
<A NAME="IDX682"></A>
<DT><CODE>--password=...</CODE>
<DD>
Password for user for <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX683"></A>
<DT><CODE>--tcp-ip</CODE>
<DD>
Connect to the MySQL server(s) via the TCP/IP port instead of
the Unix socket. This affects stopping and reporting.  If a socket file
is missing, the server may still be running, but can be accessed only
via the TCP/IP port.  By default, connections are made using the Unix socket.
<A NAME="IDX684"></A>
<DT><CODE>--user=...</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL user for <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX685"></A>
<DT><CODE>--version</CODE>
<DD>
Print the version number and exit.
</DL>

<P>
Some notes about <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make sure that the MySQL user, who is stopping the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> services (e.g using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> program) have the same
password and username for all the data directories accessed (to the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database) And make sure that the user has the <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE>
privilege! If you have many data directories and many different <CODE>mysql</CODE>
databases with different passwords for the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user,
you may want to create a common <CODE>multi_admin</CODE> user for each using the
same password (see below). Example how to do it:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -proot_password -e
"GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* TO multi_admin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'multipass'"
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges">4.2.6  How the Privilege System Works</A>.
You will have to do the above for each <CODE>mysqld</CODE> running in each
data directory, that you have (just change the socket, <CODE>-S=...</CODE>).
<LI>

<CODE>pid-file</CODE> is very important, if you are using <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>
to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> (for example, <CODE>--mysqld=mysqld_safe</CODE>) Every
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> should have its own <CODE>pid-file</CODE>. The advantage
using <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> instead of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly here is,
that <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> ``guards'' every <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process and will
restart it, if a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process terminates due to a signal
sent using <CODE>kill -9</CODE>, or for other reasons such as a segmentation
fault (which MySQL should never do, of course;). Please note that the
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script may require that you start it from a certain
place. This means that you may have to <CODE>cd</CODE> to a certain directory,
before you start the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>. If you have problems starting,
please see the <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script. Check especially the lines:


<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY_PWD=`pwd` Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary
release) if test -d /data/mysql -a -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys
-a -x ./bin/mysqld
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.
The above test should be successful, or you may encounter problems.
<LI>

Beware of the dangers starting multiple <CODE>mysqld</CODE>s in the same data
directory.  Use separate data directories, unless you <STRONG>know</STRONG> what
you are doing!
<LI>

The socket file and the TCP/IP port must be different for every <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

The first and fifth <CODE>mysqld</CODE> group were intentionally left out from
the example.  You may have 'gaps' in the config file. This gives you
more flexibility.  The order in which the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE> are started or
stopped depends on the order in which they appear in the config file.
<LI>

When you want to refer to a certain group using GNR with this program,
just use the number in the end of the group name.
For example, the GNR for a group named <CODE>[mysqld17]</CODE> is 17.
<LI>

You may want to use option <CODE>--user</CODE> for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, but in order to
do this you need to run the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> script as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE>
user. Having the option in the config file doesn't matter; you will
just get a warning, if you are not the superuser and the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE>
are started under <STRONG>your</STRONG> Unix account. <STRONG>Important</STRONG>: Make
sure that the <CODE>pid-file</CODE> and the data directory are
read+write(+execute for the latter one) accessible for <STRONG>that</STRONG>
Unix user, who the specific <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process is started
as. <STRONG>Do not</STRONG> use the Unix root account for this, unless you
<STRONG>know</STRONG> what you are doing!
<LI>

<STRONG>Most important</STRONG>: Make sure that you understand the meanings of
the options that are passed to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>s and <STRONG>why one
would want</STRONG> to have separate <CODE>mysqld</CODE> processes. Starting multiple
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>s in one data directory <STRONG>will not</STRONG> give you extra
performance in a threaded system!

<A NAME="IDX688"></A>
<A NAME="IDX689"></A>
<A NAME="IDX690"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> is used to compress MyISAM tables, and <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>
is used to compress ISAM tables. Because ISAM tables are deprecated, we
will only discuss <CODE>myisampack</CODE> here, but everything said about
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> should also be true for <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> works by compressing each column in the table separately.
The information needed to decompress columns is read into memory when the
table is opened. This results in much better performance when accessing
individual records, because you only have to uncompress exactly one record, not
a much larger disk block as when using Stacker on MS-DOS.
Usually, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> packs the datafile 40%-70%.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses memory mapping (<CODE>mmap()</CODE>) on compressed tables and
falls back to normal read/write file usage if <CODE>mmap()</CODE> doesn't work.

</P>
<P>
Please note the following:

<UL>
<LI>

After packing, the table is read-only. This is generally intended
(such as when accessing packed tables on a CD). Also allowing writes
to a packed table is on our TODO list but with low priority.
<LI>

<CODE>myisampack</CODE> can also pack <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
The older <CODE>pack_isam</CODE> (for <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables) can not do this.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisampack [options] filename ...
</PRE>

<P>
Each filename should be the name of an index (<TT>`.MYI'</TT>) file.  If you
are not in the database directory, you should specify the pathname to the
file.  It is permissible to omit the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> extension.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b, --backup</CODE>
<DD>
Make a backup of the table as <CODE>tbl_name.OLD</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-#, --debug=debug_options</CODE>
<DD>
Output debug log. The <CODE>debug_options</CODE> string often is
<CODE>'d:t:o,filename'</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Force packing of the table even if it becomes bigger or if the temporary file
exists.  <CODE>myisampack</CODE> creates a temporary file named <TT>`tbl_name.TMD'</TT>
while it compresses the table.  If you kill <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, the <TT>`.TMD'</TT>
file may not be deleted.  Normally, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> exits with an error if
it finds that <TT>`tbl_name.TMD'</TT> exists.  With <CODE>--force</CODE>,
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> packs the table anyway.

<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DT><CODE>-j big_tbl_name, --join=big_tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Join all tables named on the command-line into a single table
<CODE>big_tbl_name</CODE>.  All tables that are to be combined
<STRONG>must</STRONG> be identical (same column names and types, same indexes, etc.).

<DT><CODE>-p #, --packlength=#</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the record length storage size, in bytes.  The value should be 1, 2,
or 3.  (<CODE>myisampack</CODE> stores all rows with length pointers of 1, 2, or 3
bytes.  In most normal cases, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> can determine the right length
value before it begins packing the file, but it may notice during the packing
process that it could have used a shorter length. In this case,
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> will print a note that the next time you pack the same file,
you could use a shorter record length.)

<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

<DT><CODE>-t, --test</CODE>
<DD>
Don't actually pack table, just test packing it.

<DT><CODE>-T dir_name, --tmp_dir=dir_name</CODE>
<DD>
Use the named directory as the location in which to write the temporary table.

<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Write information about progress and packing result.

<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Display version information and exit.

<DT><CODE>-w, --wait</CODE>
<DD>
Wait and retry if table is in use.  If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server was
invoked with the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option, it is not a good idea
to invoke <CODE>myisampack</CODE> if the table might be updated during the
packing process.

values that are only binary 0's; these will occupy 1 bit.

<DT><CODE>empty-fill</CODE>
<DD>
The number of integer columns that don't occupy the full byte range of their
type; these are changed to a smaller type (for example, an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>
column may be changed to <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>).

<DT><CODE>pre-space</CODE>
<DD>
The number of decimal columns that are stored with leading spaces. In this
case, each value will contain a count for the number of leading spaces.

<DT><CODE>end-space</CODE>
<DD>
The number of columns that have a lot of trailing spaces.  In this case, each
value will contain a count for the number of trailing spaces.

<DT><CODE>table-lookup</CODE>
<DD>
The column had only a small number of different values, which were
converted to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> before Huffman compression.

<DT><CODE>zero</CODE>
<DD>
The number of columns for which all values are zero.

<DT><CODE>Original trees</CODE>
<DD>
The initial number of Huffman trees.

<DT><CODE>After join</CODE>
<DD>
The number of distinct Huffman trees left after joining
trees to save some header space.
</DL>

<P>
After a table has been compressed, <CODE>myisamchk -dvv</CODE> prints additional
information about each field:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Type</CODE>
<DD>
The field type may contain the following descriptors:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>constant</CODE>
<DD>
All rows have the same value.

<DT><CODE>no endspace</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store endspace.

<DT><CODE>no endspace, not_always</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store endspace and don't do end space compression for all values.

<DT><CODE>no endspace, no empty</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store endspace. Don't store empty values.

<DT><CODE>table-lookup</CODE>
<DD>
The column was converted to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>zerofill(n)</CODE>
<DD>
The most significant <CODE>n</CODE> bytes in the value are always 0 and are not
stored.

<DT><CODE>no zeros</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store zeros.

<DT><CODE>always zero</CODE>
<DD>
0 values are stored in 1 bit.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>Huff tree</CODE>
<DD>
The Huffman tree associated with the field.

<DT><CODE>Bits</CODE>
<DD>
The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.
</DL>

<P>
After you have run <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>/<CODE>myisampack</CODE> you must run
<CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to re-create the index.  At this time you
can also sort the index blocks and create statistics needed for
the MySQL optimiser to work more efficiently:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.MYI
isamchk   -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
After you have installed the packed table into the MySQL database
directory you should do <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> to force <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
to start using the new table.

</P>
<P>
If you want to unpack a packed table, you can do this with the
<CODE>--unpack</CODE> option to <CODE>isamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

<P>
The option for enabling InnoDB support is needed only in MySQL 3.23. In MySQL

</P>
<P>
You can find the MySQL-Max binaries at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-max-4.0.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-max-4.0.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
The Windows MySQL binary distributions includes both the
standard <CODE>mysqld.exe</CODE> binary and the <CODE>mysqld-max.exe</CODE> binary.
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html</a>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_installation">2.1.1  Installing MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that as BerkeleyDB (BDB) is not available for all platforms,
so some of the <CODE>Max</CODE> binaries may not have support for it.
You can check which table types are supported by doing the following
query:

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>:  To be able to create InnoDB tables in MySQL version 3.23
you <STRONG>must</STRONG> edit
your startup options to include at least the <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>
option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_in_MySQL_3.23">7.5.2  InnoDB in MySQL Version 3.23</A>.

</P>

To get better performance for BDB tables, you should add some configuration
options for these, too. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB_start">7.6.3  <CODE>BDB</CODE> startup options</A>.

<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> automatically tries to start any <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary
with the <CODE>-max</CODE> suffix. This makes it very easy to test out
another <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary in an existing installation.  Just
run <CODE>configure</CODE> with the options you want and then install the
new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary as <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> in the same directory
where your old <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary is. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_safe">4.7.2  <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

<P>
On Linux, the <CODE>MySQL-Max</CODE> RPM uses the above mentioned <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>
feature. (It just installs the <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> executable, so
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> automatically uses this executable when
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> is restarted.)

The following table shows which table types our MySQL-Max
binaries include:

On Unix,
the <TT>`mysql'</TT> client uses the file named in the <CODE>MYSQL_HISTFILE</CODE>
environment variable to save the command-line history. The default value for
the history file is <TT>`$HOME/.mysql_history'</TT>, where <CODE>$HOME</CODE> is the

The following list briefly describes the client-side MySQL programs:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX710"></A>
 
A shell script that converts <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs to MySQL. It doesn't
handle all cases, but it gives a good start when converting.

<A NAME="IDX711"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysql</CODE>
<DD>
The command-line tool for interactively entering queries or executing
queries from a file in batch mode.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql">4.8.2  <CODE>mysql</CODE>, The Command-line Tool</A>.

<A NAME="IDX712"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>
<DD>
A script that checks the access privileges for a host, user, and database
combination.

<A NAME="IDX713"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
<DD>
Utility for performing administrative operations, such as creating or
dropping databases, reloading the grant tables, flushing tables to disk, and
reopening log files.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can also be used to retrieve version,
process, and status information from the server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqladmin">4.8.3  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, Administrating a MySQL Server</A>.

<A NAME="IDX714"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>
<DD>
Utility for reading queries from a binary log. Can be used to recover
from a crash with an old backup.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlbinlog">4.8.4  <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>, Executing the queries from a binary log</A>.

<A NAME="IDX715"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqldump</CODE>
<DD>
Dumps a MySQL database into a file as SQL statements or
as tab-separated text files. Enhanced freeware originally by Igor Romanenko.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.6  <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.

<A NAME="IDX716"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>
<DD>
Imports text files into their respective tables using <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlimport">4.8.8  <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>, Importing Data from Text Files</A>.

<DT><CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>
<DD>
Displays information about databases, tables, columns, and indexes.

<A NAME="IDX718"></A>
<DT><CODE>replace</CODE>
<DD>
A utility program that is used by <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>, but that has more
general applicability as well.  <CODE>replace</CODE> changes strings in place in
files or on the standard input. Uses a finite state machine to match longer
strings first. Can be used to swap strings. For example, this command
swaps <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE> in the given files:


<PRE>
shell&#62; replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

<CODE>mysql</CODE> is a simple SQL shell (with GNU <CODE>readline</CODE> capabilities).
It supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used interactively,
query results are presented in an ASCII-table format. When used
non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in
tab-separated format.  (The output format can be changed using command-line
options.)  You can run scripts simply like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; script.sql &#62; output.tab
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems due to insufficient memory in the client, use the
<CODE>--quick</CODE> option!  This forces <CODE>mysql</CODE> to use
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> rather than <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> to
retrieve the result set.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>mysql</CODE> is very easy. Just start it as follows:
<CODE>mysql database</CODE> or <CODE>mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password
database</CODE>. Type an SQL statement, end it with <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\g'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`\G'</SAMP>
and press Enter.

If the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client loses connection to the server while
sending it a query, it will immediately and automatically try to
reconnect once to the server and send the query again.
Note that even if it succeeds in reconnecting, as your first
connection has ended, all your previous session objects are lost: temporary
tables, user and session variables. Therefore, the above behaviour may
be dangerous for you, as in this example where the server was shut
down and restarted without you knowing it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; set @a=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>@a</CODE> user variable has been lost with the connection, and
after the reconnection it is undefined.
To protect from this risk, you can start the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client
with the <CODE>--disable-reconnect</CODE> option.

<P>
If you type 'help' on the command-line, <CODE>mysql</CODE> will print out the

mysql&#62; help

MySQL commands:
help      (\h)    Display this text.
?         (\h)    Synonym for `help'.
clear     (\c)    Clear command.
connect   (\r)    Reconnect to the server.
                  Optional arguments are db and host.
delimiter (\d)    Set query delimiter.

The <CODE>edit</CODE>, <CODE>nopager</CODE>, <CODE>pager</CODE>, and <CODE>system</CODE> commands
work only in Unix.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX777"></A>
The <CODE>status</CODE> command gives you some information about the
connection and the server you are using. If you are running in the
<CODE>--safe-updates</CODE> mode, <CODE>status</CODE> will also print the values for
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> variables that affect your queries.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX778"></A>
A useful startup option for beginners (introduced in MySQL
Version 3.23.11) is <CODE>--safe-updates</CODE> (or <CODE>--i-am-a-dummy</CODE> for
users that once may have done a <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> but forgot
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause).  When using this option, <CODE>mysql</CODE> sends
the following command to the MySQL server when opening the connection:

</P>

<PRE>
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1,SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=#select_limit#,
    SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=#max_join_size#"
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>#select_limit#</CODE> and <CODE>#max_join_size#</CODE> are variables that
can be set from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The effect of the above is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are not allowed to do an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement
if you don't have a key constraint in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part. One can,
however, force an <CODE>UPDATE/DELETE</CODE> by using <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>:

<PRE>
UPDATE table_name SET not_key_column=# WHERE not_key_column=# LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

<LI>

All big results are automatically limited to <CODE>#select_limit#</CODE> rows.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s that will probably need to examine more than
<CODE>#max_join_size</CODE> row combinations will be aborted.
</UL>

<P>
Some useful hints about the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client:

</P>
<P>
Some data is much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of
the usual horizontal box type output. For example longer text, which
includes new lines, is often much easier to be read with vertical
output.

Yes, please do that.

<P>
For logging, you can use the <CODE>tee</CODE> option. The <CODE>tee</CODE> can be
started with option <CODE>--tee=...</CODE>, or from the command-line
interactively with command <CODE>tee</CODE>. All the data displayed on the
screen will also be appended into a given file. This can be very useful
for debugging purposes also. The <CODE>tee</CODE> can be disabled from the
command-line with command <CODE>notee</CODE>. Executing <CODE>tee</CODE> again
starts logging again. Without a parameter the previous file will be
used. Note that <CODE>tee</CODE> will flush the results into the file after
each command, just before the command-line appears again waiting for the
next command.

</P>
<P>
Browsing, or searching the results in the interactive mode in Unix less,
more, or any other similar program, is now possible with option
<CODE>--pager[=...]</CODE>. Without argument, <CODE>mysql</CODE> client will look
for the <CODE>PAGER</CODE> environment variable and set <CODE>pager</CODE> to that.
<CODE>pager</CODE> can be started from the interactive command-line with
command <CODE>pager</CODE> and disabled with command <CODE>nopager</CODE>.  The
command takes an argument optionally and the <CODE>pager</CODE> will be set to
that. Command <CODE>pager</CODE> can be called without an argument, but this
requires that the option <CODE>--pager</CODE> was used, or the <CODE>pager</CODE>
will default to stdout. <CODE>pager</CODE> works only in Unix, since it uses
the <CODE>popen()</CODE> function, which doesn't exist in Windows. In Windows, the
<CODE>tee</CODE> option can be used instead, although it may not be as handy
as <CODE>pager</CODE> can be in some situations.

</P>
<P>
A few tips about <CODE>pager</CODE>:

<UL>
<LI>

You can use it to write to a file:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager cat &#62; /tmp/log.txt
</PRE>

and the results will only go to a file. You can also pass any options
for the programs that you want to use with the <CODE>pager</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager less -n -i -S
</PRE>

<LI>

From the above do note the option <CODE>-S</CODE>. You may find it very useful when
browsing the results; try the option with horizontal output (end
commands with <CODE>\g</CODE>, or <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) and with vertical output (end commands with
<CODE>\G</CODE>). Sometimes a very wide result set is hard to be read from the screen,
with option <CODE>-S</CODE> to <CODE>less</CODE> you can browse the results within the interactive
<CODE>less</CODE> from left to right, preventing lines longer than your screen from
being continued to the next line. This can make the result set much more
readable. You can switch the mode between on and off within the interactive
<CODE>less</CODE> with <CODE>-S</CODE>. See the 'h' for more help about <CODE>less</CODE>.

<LI>

You can combine very complex ways to handle the results, for example the
following would send the results to two files in two different
directories, on two different hard-disks mounted on /dr1 and /dr2, yet
let the results still be seen on the screen via less:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt | \
tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
You can also combine the two functions above; have the <CODE>tee</CODE>
enabled, <CODE>pager</CODE> set to 'less' and you will be able to browse the
results in Unix 'less' and still have everything appended into a file
the same time. The difference between Unix <CODE>tee</CODE> used with the
<CODE>pager</CODE> and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client in-built <CODE>tee</CODE>, is that
the in-built <CODE>tee</CODE> works even if you don't have the Unix <CODE>tee</CODE>
available. The in-built <CODE>tee</CODE> also logs everything that is printed
on the screen, where the Unix <CODE>tee</CODE> used with <CODE>pager</CODE> doesn't
log quite that much. Last, but not least, the interactive <CODE>tee</CODE> is
more handy to switch on and off, when you want to log something into a
file, but want to be able to turn the feature off sometimes.

</P>
<P>
You can examine the binary log file (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>) with the
<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> utility.

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.001
</PRE>

<P>
will print all queries contained in binlog <TT>`hostname-bin.001'</TT>,
together with information (time the query took, ID of the thread which
issued it, timestamp when it was issued etc).

</P>
<P>
You can pipe the output of <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> into a <CODE>mysql</CODE>
client; this is used to recover from a crash when you have an old
backup (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.001 | mysql
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.[0-9]* | mysql
</PRE>

<P>
You can also redirect the output of <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> to a text file
instead, modify this text file (to cut queries you don't want to
execute for some reason), then execute the queries from the text file
into <CODE>mysql</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> has the <CODE>position=#</CODE> options which will print
only queries whose offset in the binlog is greater or equal to <CODE>#</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you have more than one binary log to execute on the MySQL server,
the safe method is to do it in one unique MySQL connection. Here is
what may be UNsafe:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.001 | mysql # DANGER!!
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.002 | mysql # DANGER!!
</PRE>

<P>
It will cause problems if the first binlog contains a <CODE>CREATE
TEMPORARY TABLE</CODE> and the second one contains a query which uses this
temporary table: when the first <CODE>mysql</CODE> terminates, it will drop
the temporary table, so the second <CODE>mysql</CODE> will report ``unknown
table''. This is why you should run all binlogs you want in one unique
connection, especially if you use temporary tables. Here are two
possible ways:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.001 hostname-bin.002 | mysql
</PRE>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.001 &#62;  /tmp/queries.sql
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.002 &#62;&#62; /tmp/queries.sql
shell&#62; mysql -e "source /tmp/queries.sql"
</PRE>

<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.14, <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> can prepare suitable input 
for <CODE>mysql</CODE> to
execute a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> from a binlog. As the binlog
contains the data to load (this is true for MySQL 4.0; MySQL 3.23 did
not write the loaded data into the binlog, so the original
file was needed when one wanted to execute the content of
the binlog), <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> will copy this data to a
temporary file and print a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command for
<CODE>mysql</CODE> to load
this temporary file. The location where the temporary file is
created is by default the temporary directory; it can be changed with
the <CODE>local-load</CODE> option of <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.1, <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> could not prepare suitable output
for <CODE>mysql</CODE> when the binary log contained queries from different
threads using temporary tables of the same name, if these queries were
interlaced. This is solved in MySQL 4.1.

</P>
<P>
You can also use <CODE>mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server</CODE> to read
the binary log directly from a remote MySQL server.  However, this is
something that is deprecated as we instead want to make it easy to to
apply binary logs to a running MySQL server.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlbinlog --help</CODE> will give you more information.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Using_mysqlcheck" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_mysqlcheck">4.8.5  Using <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A></H3>

<P>
Since MySQL version 3.23.38 you will be able to use a new
checking and repairing tool for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. The difference to
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is that <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> should be used when the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is running, whereas <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> should be used
when it is not. The benefit is that you no longer have to take down the
server for checking or repairing your tables.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> uses MySQL server commands <CODE>CHECK</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> and <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> in a convenient way
for the user.

</P>
<P>
There are three alternative ways to invoke <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] database [tables]
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --all-databases
</PRE>

<P>
So it can be used in a similar way as <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> when it
comes to what databases and tables you want to choose.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> does have a special feature compared to the other
clients; the default behaviour, checking tables (-c), can be changed by
renaming the binary. So if you want to have a tool that repairs tables
by default, you should just copy <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> to your harddrive
with a new name, <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE>, or alternatively make a symbolic
link to <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE> and name the symbolic link as
<CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE>. If you invoke <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE> now, it will repair
tables by default.

</P>
<P>
The names that you can use to change <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> default behaviour
are here:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqlrepair:   The default option will be -r
mysqlanalyze:  The default option will be -a
mysqloptimize: The default option will be -o
</PRE>

<P>
The options available for <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> are listed here, please
check what your version supports with <CODE>mysqlcheck --help</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A, --all-databases</CODE>
<DD>
Check all the databases. This will be same as --databases with all
databases selected
<DT><CODE>-1, --all-in-1</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of making one query for each table, execute all queries in 1
query separately for each database. Table names will be in a comma
separated list.
<DT><CODE>-a, --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
Analyse given tables.
<DT><CODE>--auto-repair</CODE>
<DD>
If a checked table is corrupted, automatically fix it. Repairing will be
done after all tables have been checked, if corrupted ones were found.
<DT><CODE>-#, --debug=...</CODE>
<DD>
Output debug log. Often this is 'd:t:o,filename'
<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=...</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are
<DT><CODE>-c, --check</CODE>
<DD>
Check table for errors
<DT><CODE>-C, --check-only-changed</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that have changed since last check or haven't been
closed properly.
<DT><CODE>--compress</CODE>
<DD>
Use compression in server/client protocol.
<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display this help message and exit.
<DT><CODE>-B, --databases</CODE>
<DD>
To check several databases. Note the difference in usage; in this case
no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as database names.
<DT><CODE>--default-character-set=...</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default character set
<DT><CODE>-F, --fast</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that hasn't been closed properly
<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Continue even if we get an sql-error.
<DT><CODE>-e, --extended</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it will ensure that the
table is 100 percent consistent, but will take a long time.

If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will run an extended
repair on the table, which may not only take a long time to execute, but
may produce a lot of garbage rows also!
<DT><CODE>-h, --host=...</CODE>
<DD>
Connect to host.
<DT><CODE>-m, --medium-check</CODE>
<DD>
Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99 percent of all
errors. Should be good enough for most cases.
<DT><CODE>-o, --optimize</CODE>
<DD>
Optimise table
<DT><CODE>-p, --password[=...]</CODE>
<DD>
Password to use when connecting to server. If password is not given
it's solicited on the tty.
<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to use for TCP/IP connections.
<DT><CODE><CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
To specify the connect protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.
<DT><CODE>-q, --quick</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it prevents the check
from scanning the rows to check for wrong links. This is the fastest
check.

If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will try to repair
only the index tree. This is the fastest repair method for a table.
<DT><CODE>-r, --repair</CODE>
<DD>
Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique.
<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Print only error messages.
<DT><CODE>-S, --socket=...</CODE>
<DD>
Socket file to use for connection.
<DT><CODE>--tables</CODE>
<DD>
Overrides option --databases (-B).
<DT><CODE>-u, --user=#</CODE>
<DD>
User for login if not current user.
<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Print information about the various stages.
<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Output version information and exit.

<DD>
Dump all the databases. This will be same as <CODE>--databases</CODE> with all
databases selected.
<DT><CODE>-a, --all</CODE>
<DD>
Include all MySQL-specific create options.
<DT><CODE>--allow-keywords</CODE>
<DD>
Allow creation of column names that are keywords.  This works by
prefixing each column name with the table name.
<DT><CODE>-c, --complete-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Use complete insert statements (with column names).
<DT><CODE>-C, --compress</CODE>
<DD>
Compress all information between the client and the server if both support
compression.
<DT><CODE>-B, --databases</CODE>
<DD>
To dump several databases. Note the difference in usage. In this case
no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as database names.
<CODE>USE db_name;</CODE> will be included in the output before each new database.
<DT><CODE>--delayed</CODE>
<DD>
Insert rows with the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> command.
<DT><CODE>-e, --extended-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Use the new multiline <CODE>INSERT</CODE> syntax. (Gives more compact and
faster inserts statements.)
<DT><CODE>-#, --debug[=option_string]</CODE>
<DD>
Trace usage of the program (for debugging).
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.
<DT><CODE>--fields-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-escaped-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--lines-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
These options are used with the <CODE>-T</CODE> option and have the same
meaning as the corresponding clauses for <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<DT><CODE>-F, --flush-logs</CODE>
<DD>
Flush log file in the MySQL server before starting the dump.
<DT><CODE>-f, --force,</CODE>
<DD>
Continue even if we get an SQL error during a table dump.
<DT><CODE>-h, --host=..</CODE>
<DD>
Dump data from the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-l, --lock-tables.</CODE>
<DD>
Lock all tables before starting the dump.  The tables are locked with
<CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> to allow concurrent inserts in the case of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.

Please note that when dumping multiple databases, <CODE>--lock-tables</CODE>
will lock tables for each database separately. So using this option will
not guarantee your tables will be logically consistent between databases.
Tables in different databases may be dumped in completely different
states.
<DT><CODE>-K, --disable-keys</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tb_name DISABLE KEYS */;</CODE> and
<CODE>/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tb_name ENABLE KEYS */;</CODE>
will be put in the output.  This will make loading the data into a MySQL
4.0 server faster as the indexes are created after all data are inserted.
<DT><CODE>-n, --no-create-db</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ db_name;</CODE> will not be put in the
output. The above line will be added otherwise, if a <CODE>--databases</CODE> or
<CODE>--all-databases</CODE> option was given.
<DT><CODE>-t, --no-create-info</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write table creation information (the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement).
<DT><CODE>-d, --no-data</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write any row information for the table.  This is very useful if you
just want to get a dump of the structure for a table!
<DT><CODE>--opt</CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>--quick --add-drop-table --add-locks --extended-insert
--lock-tables</CODE>.  Should give you the fastest possible dump for reading
into a MySQL server.
<DT><CODE>-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]</CODE>
<DD>
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
no <SAMP>`=your_pass'</SAMP> part,
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> you will be prompted for a password.
<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to use for TCP/IP connections.
<DT><CODE><CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
To specify the connect protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.
<DT><CODE>-q, --quick</CODE>
<DD>
Don't buffer query, dump directly to stdout. Uses <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
to do this.
<DT><CODE>-Q, --quote-names</CODE>
<DD>
Quote table and column names within <SAMP>``'</SAMP> characters.
<DT><CODE>-r, --result-file=...</CODE>
<DD>
Direct output to a given file. This option should be used in MSDOS,
because it prevents new line <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> from being converted to <SAMP>`\n\r'</SAMP>
(new line + carriage return).
<DT><CODE>--single-transaction</CODE>
<DD>
This option issues a <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> SQL command before dumping data from
server. It is mostly useful with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables and
<CODE>READ_COMMITTED</CODE> transaction isolation level, as in this mode it
will dump the consistent state of the database at the time then
<CODE>BEGIN</CODE> was issued without blocking any applications.

When using this option you should keep in mind that only transactional
tables will be dumped in a consistent state, for example, any <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables dumped while using this option may still change
state.

The <CODE>--single-transaction</CODE> option was added in version 4.0.2.
This option is mutually exclusive with the <CODE>--lock-tables</CODE> option
as <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> already commits a previous transaction internally.
<DT><CODE>-S /path/to/socket, --socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
The socket file to use when connecting to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the
default host).
<DT><CODE>--tables</CODE>
<DD>
Overrides option --databases (-B).
<DT><CODE>-T, --tab=path-to-some-directory</CODE>
<DD>
Creates a <CODE>table_name.sql</CODE> file, that contains the SQL CREATE commands,
and a <CODE>table_name.txt</CODE> file, that contains the data, for each give table.
The format of the <TT>`.txt'</TT> file is made according to the
<CODE>--fields-xxx</CODE> and <CODE>--lines--xxx</CODE> options.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: This option only works if <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> is run on the same
machine as the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon. You must use a MySQL account that has the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege, and the login user/group that <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
is running as (normally user <CODE>mysql</CODE>, group <CODE>mysql</CODE>) must have
permission to create/write a file at the location you specify.
<DT><CODE>-u user_name, --user=user_name</CODE>
<DD>
The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
default value is your Unix login name.
<DT><CODE>-O var=option, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value of a variable.  The possible variables are listed below.
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE>
is deprecated since MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--var=option</CODE> on its own.
<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Print out more information on what the program does.
<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Print version information and exit.
<DT><CODE>-w, --where='where-condition'</CODE>
<DD>
Dump only selected records. Note that quotes are mandatory:

<PRE>
"--where=user='jimf'" "-wuserid&#62;1" "-wuserid&#60;1"
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>-X, --xml</CODE>
<DD>
Dumps a database as well formed XML
<DT><CODE>-x, --first-slave</CODE>
<DD>
Locks all tables across all databases.
<DT><CODE>--master-data</CODE>
<DD>
Like <CODE>--first-slave</CODE>, but also prints some <CODE>CHANGE MASTER
TO</CODE> commands which will later make your slave start from the right position
in the master's binlogs, if you have set up your slave using this SQL
dump of the master.
<DT><CODE>-O net_buffer_length=#, where # &#60; 16M</CODE>
<DD>
When creating multi-row-insert statements (as with option
<CODE>--extended-insert</CODE> or <CODE>--opt</CODE>), <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will create
rows up to <CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> length. If you increase this
variable, you should also ensure that the <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>
variable in the MySQL server is bigger than the
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
The most normal use of <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> is probably for making a backup of
whole databases. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --opt database &#62; backup-file.sql
</PRE>

<P>
You can read this back into MySQL with:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql database &#60; backup-file.sql
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -e "source /patch-to-backup/backup-file.sql" database
</PRE>

<P>
However, it's also very useful to populate another MySQL server with
information from a database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --opt database | mysql --host=remote-host -C database
</PRE>

<P>
It is possible to dump several databases with one command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --databases database1 [database2 ...] &#62; my_databases.sql
</PRE>

<P>
If all the databases are wanted, one can use:

<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> provides a command-line interface to the <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE> SQL statement.  Most options to <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> correspond
directly to the same options to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlimport [options] database textfile1 [textfile2 ...]
</PRE>

<P>
For each text file named on the command-line,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> strips any extension from the filename and uses the result
to determine which table to import the file's contents into.  For example,
files named <TT>`patient.txt'</TT>, <TT>`patient.text'</TT>, and <TT>`patient'</TT> would
all be imported into a table named <CODE>patient</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c, --columns=...</CODE>
<DD>
This option takes a comma-separated list of field names as an argument.
The field list is used to create a proper <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command,
which is then passed to MySQL. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-C, --compress</CODE>
<DD>
Compress all information between the client and the server if both support
compression.

<DT><CODE>-#, --debug[=option_string]</CODE>
<DD>
Trace usage of the program (for debugging).

<DT><CODE>-d, --delete</CODE>
<DD>
Empty the table before importing the text file.

<DT><CODE>--fields-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-escaped-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--lines-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
These options have the same meaning as the corresponding clauses for
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore errors.  For example, if a table for a text file doesn't exist,
continue processing any remaining files.  Without <CODE>--force</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> exits if a table doesn't exist.

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DT><CODE>-h host_name, --host=host_name</CODE>
<DD>
Import data to the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-i, --ignore</CODE>
<DD>
See the description for the <CODE>--replace</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>--ignore-lines=n</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore first <CODE>n</CODE> lines of the datafile.

<DT><CODE>-l, --lock-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Lock <STRONG>all</STRONG> tables for writing before processing any text files. This
ensures that all tables are synchronised on the server.

<DT><CODE>-L, --local</CODE>
<DD>
Read input files from the client.  By default, text files are assumed to be on
the server if you connect to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the default host).

<DT><CODE>-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]</CODE>
<DD>
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
no <SAMP>`=your_pass'</SAMP> part,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> you will be prompted for a password.

<DT><CODE>-P port_num, --port=port_num</CODE>
<DD>
TCP/IP port number to use for connection.

<A NAME="IDX809"></A>
<DT><CODE><CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
To specify the connect protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

<DT><CODE>-r, --replace</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>--replace</CODE> and <CODE>--ignore</CODE> options control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
<CODE>--replace</CODE>, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify <CODE>--ignore</CODE>, input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option, an
error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text
file is ignored.

If the last argument contains a shell or SQL wildcard (<CODE>*</CODE>,
<CODE>?</CODE>, <CODE>%</CODE> or <CODE>_</CODE>) then only what's matched by the wildcard

with backslash (some Unix shells will require two), in order to get
tables / columns properly. '*' are converted into SQL '%' wildcard and
'?' into SQL '_' wildcard.  This may cause some confusion when you try
to display the columns for a table with a <CODE>_</CODE> as in this case
<CODE>mysqlshow</CODE> only shows you the table names that match the pattern.

<H3><A NAME="Batch_Commands" HREF="manual_toc.html#Batch_Commands">4.8.12  How to Run SQL Commands from a Text File</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>mysql</CODE> client typically is used interactively, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database
</PRE>

<P>
However, it's also possible to put your SQL commands in a file and tell
<CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its input from that file.  To do so, create a text
file <TT>`text_file'</TT> that contains the commands you wish to execute.
Then invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE> as shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; text_file
</PRE>

<P>
You can also start your text file with a <CODE>USE db_name</CODE> statement.  In
this case, it is unnecessary to specify the database name on the command
line:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; text_file
</PRE>

<P>
If you are already running <CODE>mysql</CODE>, you can execute an SQL
script file using the <CODE>source</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; source filename;
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL has several different log files that can help you find
out what's going on inside <CODE>mysqld</CODE>:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Log file</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>The error log </TD><TD> Problems encountering starting, running or stopping <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

<TR><TD>The update log </TD><TD> Deprecated: Stores all statements that changes data
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>The binary log </TD><TD> Stores all statements that changes something. Used also for replication
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>The slow log </TD><TD> Stores all queries that took more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds to execute or didn't use indexes.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
All logs can be found in the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> data directory.  You can
force <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to reopen the log files (or in some cases
switch to a new log) by executing <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Error_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A></H3>

<P>
The error log file contains information indicating when <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
was started and stopped and also any critical errors found when running.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies unexpectedly and <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> needs to
restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will write a <CODE>restarted
mysqld</CODE> row in this file.  This log also holds a warning if
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> notices a table that needs to be automatically checked or
repaired.

</P>
<P>
On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace
for where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died. This can be used to find out where
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> died.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_stack_trace">E.1.4  Using a Stack Trace</A>.

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10 you can specify where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> stores the
error log file with the option <CODE>--log-error[=filename]</CODE>. If no file
name is given <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will use <CODE>mysql-data-dir/'hostname'.err</CODE> on
Unix and <TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> on Windows.
If you execute <CODE>flush logs</CODE> the old file will be prefixed with
<CODE>--old</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will create a new empty log file.

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions the error log handling was done by
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> which redirected the error file to
<CODE>'hostname'.err</CODE>.  One could change this file name with the option
<CODE>--err-log=filename</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify <CODE>--log-error</CODE> or if you use the <CODE>--console</CODE>
option the errors will be written to stderr (the terminal).

</P>
<P>
On Windows, the output is always written to the <CODE>.err</CODE> file if
<CODE>--console</CODE> is not given.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Query_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX820"></A>
<A NAME="IDX821"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you want to know what happens within <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you should start
it with <CODE>--log[=file]</CODE>.  This will log all connections and queries
to the log file (by default named <TT>`'hostname'.log'</TT>).  This log can
be very useful when you suspect an error in a client and want to know
exactly what <CODE>mysqld</CODE> thought the client sent to it.

</P>
<P>
Older versions of the <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script (from MySQL 3.23.4 to 3.23.8)
pass <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> a <CODE>--log</CODE> option (enable general query log).
If you need better performance when you start using MySQL in a production
environment, you can remove the <CODE>--log</CODE> option from <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>
or change it to <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
The entries in this log are written as <CODE>mysqld</CODE> receives the questions.
This may be different from the order in which the statements are executed.
This is in contrast to the update log and the binary log which are written
after the query is executed, but before any locks are released.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Update_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX822"></A>
<A NAME="IDX823"></A>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: the update log is replaced by the binary
log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.  With this you can do anything that you can do
with the update log. <STRONG>The update log will be removed in MySQL 5.0</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-update[=file_name]</CODE> option,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update
data. If no filename is given, it defaults to the name of the host
machine. If a filename is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the file
is written in the data directory. If <TT>`file_name'</TT> doesn't have an
extension, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will create log file names like so:
<TT>`file_name.###'</TT>, where <CODE>###</CODE> is a number that is incremented each
time you execute <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>, execute <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-logs</CODE>, execute the <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> statement, or restart the server.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: for the above scheme to work, you must not create
your own files with the same filename as the update log + some extensions
that may be regarded as a number, in the directory used by the update log!

</P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>--log</CODE> or <CODE>-l</CODE> options, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a
general log with a filename of <TT>`hostname.log'</TT>, and restarts and
refreshes do not cause a new log file to be generated (although it is closed
and reopened). In this case you can copy it (on Unix) by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
mv hostname.log hostname-old.log
mysqladmin flush-logs
cp hostname-old.log to-backup-directory
rm hostname-old.log
</PRE>

<P>
Update logging is smart because it logs only statements that really update
data. So an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> that finds no
rows is not written to the log. It even skips <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that
set a column to the value it already has.

</P>
<P>
The update logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

</P>
<P>
If you want to update a database from update log files, you could do the
following (assuming your update logs have names of the form
<TT>`file_name.###'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ls -1 -t -r file_name.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>ls</CODE> is used to get all the log files in the right order.

</P>
<P>
This can be useful if you have to revert to backup files after a crash
and you want to redo the updates that occurred between the time of the backup
and the crash.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Binary_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX824"></A>
<A NAME="IDX825"></A>

</P>
<P>
The intention is that the binary log should replace the update log, so
we recommend you to switch to this log format as soon as possible! The
update log will be removed in MySQL 5.0.

</P>
<P>
The binary log contains all information that is available in the update
log in a more efficient format. It also contains information about how long
each query took that updated the database.  It doesn't contain queries that
don't modify any data.  If you want to log all queries (for example to
find a problem query) you should use the general query log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
The binary log is also used when you are replicating a slave from a master.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-bin[=file_name]</CODE> option, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update data. If no
file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine followed
by <CODE>-bin</CODE>. If file name is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the
file is written in the data directory.

</P>
<P>
If you supply an extension to <CODE>--log-bin=filename.extension</CODE>, the
extension will be silenty removed.

</P>
<P>
To the binary log filename <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will append an extension that
is a number that is incremented each time you execute <CODE>mysqladmin
refresh</CODE>, execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE>, execute the <CODE>FLUSH
LOGS</CODE> statement or restart the server. A new binary log will also
automatically be created when the current one's size reaches 
<CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>. Note if you are using
transactions: a transaction is written in one chunk to the binary log,
hence it is never split between several binary logs. Therefore, if you
have big transactions, you may see binlogs bigger than <CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can delete all binary log files with the <CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>
command (see section <A HREF="manual.html#RESET">4.5.4  <CODE>RESET</CODE> Syntax</A>), or only some of them with
<CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Master_SQL">4.10.7  SQL Statements for Controlling Master Servers</A>).

</P>
<P>
You can use the following options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to affect what is logged
to the binary log (please make sure to read the notes which follow
this table):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that it should log updates to the binary log if the
current database
(that is, the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
database is 'database_name'. All others
databases which are not explicitly mentioned are ignored.
Note that if you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in
the current database.
(Example: <CODE>binlog-do-db=some_database</CODE>)

Example of what does not work as you could expect it: if the server is
started with <CODE>binlog-do-db=sales</CODE>, and you do
<CODE>USE prices; UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</CODE>,
this query will not be written into the binary log.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that updates where the current database
(that is, the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>) is
'database_name' should not be stored in the binary log.  Note that if
you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in the current
database.
(Example: <CODE>binlog-ignore-db=some_database</CODE>)

Example of what does not work as you could expect it: if the server is
started with <CODE>binlog-ignore-db=sales</CODE>, and you do
<CODE>USE prices; UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</CODE>,
this query will be written into the binary log.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The rules are evaluated in the following order, to decide if the query
should be written to the binary log or not:

<OL>
<LI>

Are there <CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE> or <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE> rules?

<UL>
<LI>No:

write the query to the binlog and exit.
<LI>Yes:

go to step below.
</UL>

<LI>

So there are some rules (<CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE> or
<CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE> or both). Is there a current database (has any
database been selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>?)?

<UL>
<LI>No:

do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> write the query, and exit.
<LI>Yes:

go to step below.
</UL>

<LI>

There is a current database. Are there some <CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE> rules?

<UL>
<LI>Yes:

Does the current database match any of the <CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE>
rules?

<UL>
<LI>Yes:

write the query and exit.
<LI>No:

do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> write the query, and exit.
</UL>

<LI>No:

go to step below.
</UL>

<LI>

There are some <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE> rules.
Does the current database match any of the <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE>
rules?

<UL>
<LI>Yes:

do not write the query, and exit.
<LI>No:

write the query and exit.
</UL>

</OL>

<P>
So for example, a slave running with only <CODE>binlog-do-db=sales</CODE>
will not write to the binlog any query whose current database is
different from <CODE>sales</CODE> (in other words, <CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE> can
sometimes mean ``ignore other databases'').

</P>
<P>
To be able to know which different binary log files have been used,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will also create a binary log index file that
contains the name of all used binary log files. By default this has the
same name as the binary log file, with the extension <CODE>'.index'</CODE>.
You can change the name of the binary log index file with the
<CODE>--log-bin-index=[filename]</CODE> option.
You should not manually edit this file while <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running;
doing this would confuse <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log
files until you are sure that no slave will ever need to use them.
One way to do this is to do <CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE> once a day and then
remove any logs that are more than 3 days old. You can remove them
manually, or preferably using <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Master_SQL">4.10.7  SQL Statements for Controlling Master Servers</A>) which will also safely update the binary 
log index file for you  (and which can take a date argument since
MySQL 4.1)

</P>
<P>
A connection with the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege can disable the binary
logging of its queries using <CODE>SET
SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Master_SQL">4.10.7  SQL Statements for Controlling Master Servers</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can examine the binary log file with the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> utility.
For example, you can update a MySQL server from the binary log
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog log-file | mysql -h server_name
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlbinlog">4.8.4  <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>, Executing the queries from a binary log</A> for more information on the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>
utility and how to use it.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>BEGIN [WORK]</CODE> or <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE>, you must
use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the old update log,
which will be removed in MySQL 5.0.

</P>
<P>
The binary logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

</P>
<P>
Updates to non-transactional tables are stored in the binary log
immediately after execution.  For transactional tables such as <CODE>BDB</CODE>
or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, all updates (<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
or <CODE>INSERT</CODE>) that change tables are cached until a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>
command is sent to the server. At this point <CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes the whole
transaction to the binary log before the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> is executed.
Every thread will, on start, allocate a buffer of <CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE>
to buffer queries.  If a query is bigger than this, the thread will open
a temporary file to store the transaction.  The temporary file will
be deleted when the thread ends.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE> (default 4G) can be used to restrict the
total size used to cache a multi-query transaction.  If a transaction is
bigger than this it will fail and roll back.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the update or binary log, concurrent inserts will
be converted to normal inserts when using <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE> or
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE>.
This is to ensure that you can recreate an exact copy of your tables by
applying the log on a backup.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Slow_query_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX826"></A>
<A NAME="IDX827"></A>

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-slow-queries[=file_name]</CODE> option,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a log file containing all SQL commands that took
more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds to execute. The time to get the initial
table locks are not counted as execution time.

</P>
<P>
The slow query log is logged after the query is executed and after all
locks has been released. This may be different from the order in which
the statements are executed.

</P>
<P>
If no file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine
suffixed with <CODE>-slow.log</CODE>. If a filename is given, but doesn't
contain a path, the file is written in the data directory.

</P>
<P>
The slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to
execute and are thus candidates for optimisation. With a large log, that
can become a difficult task. You can pipe the slow query log through the
<CODE>mysqldumpslow</CODE> command to get a summary of the queries which
appear in the log.

</P>
<P>
You are using <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> then also queries that are not
using indexes are printed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX828"></A>
<A NAME="IDX829"></A>
<A NAME="IDX830"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL Server can create a number of different log files, which make
it easy to see what is going on. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Log_Files">4.9  The MySQL Log Files</A>. However, you must
clean up these files regularly, to ensure that the logs don't take up
too much disk space.

</P>
<P>
When using MySQL with log files, you will
want to remove/backup old log files from time to time and tell MySQL to start
logging to new files.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>
<P>
On a Linux (<CODE>Red Hat</CODE>) installation, you can use the
<CODE>mysql-log-rotate</CODE> script for this. If you installed MySQL
from an RPM distribution, the script should have been installed
automatically.  Note that you should be careful with this script if you are
using the binary log for replication!

</P>
<P>
On other systems you must install a short script yourself that you
start from <CODE>cron</CODE> to handle log files.

</P>
<P>
You can force MySQL to start using new log files by using
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE> or by using the SQL command <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>.
If you are using MySQL Version 3.21, you must use <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The above command does the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If standard logging (<CODE>--log</CODE>) or slow query logging
(<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>) is used, closes and reopens the log file
(<TT>`mysql.log'</TT> and <TT>``hostname`-slow.log'</TT> as default).
<LI>

If update logging (<CODE>--log-update</CODE>) is used, closes the update log and
opens a new log file with a higher sequence number.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using only an update log, you only have to flush the logs and then
move away the old update log files to a backup.
If you are using the normal logging, you can do something like:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql-data-directory
shell&#62; mv mysql.log mysql.old
shell&#62; mysqladmin flush-logs
</PRE>

<P>
and then take a backup and remove <TT>`mysql.old'</TT>.

Replication capabilities allowing the databases on one MySQL server to be
duplicated on another were introduced in MySQL version 3.23.15.
This section describes the various replication features in MySQL.
It serves as a reference to the options available with replication.
You will be introduced to replication and learn how to implement it.
Toward that end, there are some frequently asked questions, descriptions
of problems, and how to solve them.

</P>
<P>
We suggest that you visit our website at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>
often and read updates to this section. Replication is constantly being
improved, and we update the manual frequently with the most current
information.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Replication_Intro" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Intro">4.10.1  Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
Starting in Version 3.23.15, MySQL supports one-way replication
internally. One server acts as the master, while one or more other servers
act as slaves.  The master server keeps a binary log of updates
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>).
It also maintains an index file of the binary logs to keep track of
log rotation.  Each slave, upon connecting, informs the master where it
left off since the last successfully propagated update, catches up any updates
that have occurred since then, and then blocks and waits for the master to
notify it of new updates.

</P>
<P>
A slave can also serve as a master if you set up chained replication servers.

</P>
<P>
Note that when you are using replication, all updates to the
tables that are replicated
should be performed on the master server. Otherwise, you must always be
careful to avoid conflicts between updates that users make to tables on the
master and updates that they make to tables on the slave.

</P>
<P>
One-way replication has benefits for robustness, speed, and system
administration:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Robustness is increased with a master/slave setup.
In the event of problems with the master, you can switch to the slave as a
backup.

<LI>

The extra speed is achieved by splitting the load for processing client
queries between the master and slave servers, resulting in better client
response time.
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries may be sent to the slave to reduce query processing
load of the master. Queries that modify data should still be sent to the
master so that the master and slave to not get out of sync.  This
load-balancing strategy if effective if non-updating queries dominate,
but that is the normal case.

<LI>

Another benefit of using replication is that one can get
non-disturbing backups of the system by doing a backup on a slave
instead of doing it on the master. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Implementation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Implementation">4.10.2  Replication Implementation Overview</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX835"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL replication is based on the master server keeping track of all
changes to your database (updates, deletes, etc) in the binary
log (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>).
Each slave server receives from the master the saved queries that the master
has recorded in its binary log, so that the slave can
execute the same queries on its copy of the data.

</P>
<P>
It is <STRONG>very important</STRONG> to realise that the binary log is simply a
record starting from a fixed point in time (the moment you enable binary
logging). Any slaves that you set up will need copies of the databases on
your master as they existed at the moment you enabled binary
logging on the master. If you start your slaves with data that is not the same
as what was on the master <STRONG>when the binary log was
started</STRONG>, your slaves may fail.

</P>
<P>
The following table indicates master/slave replication compatibility between
different versions of MySQL.

<P>
As a general rule, it's always recommended to use recent MySQL versions,
because replication capabilities are continually being improved.
With regard to version 4.0, we recommend using same version for both
the master and the slave, with the exception that MySQL 4.0.2 is not
recommended for replication.

</P>
<P>
Note that when you upgrade a master from MySQL 3.23 to MySQL 4.0 (or
4.1) you should not restart replication using old 3.23 binary
logs, because this will unfortunately confuse the 4.0 slave. The upgrade
can safely be done this way, assuming you have a 3.23 master to upgrade
and you have 4.0 slaves:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Block all updates on the master (<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>).
<LI>

Wait until all the slaves have caught up all changes from the master
(use <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> on the master, and <CODE>SELECT
MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE> on the slaves). Then run <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE> on 
the slaves.
<LI>

Shut down MySQL on the master and upgrade the master to MySQL 4.0.
<LI>

Restart MySQL on the master. Record the name <TT>`&#60;name&#62;'</TT> of the master's
newly created binary log. You can obtain the name of the file by issuing
<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> on the master. Then issue these commands on each
slave:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='&#60;name&#62;', MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
mysql&#62; START SLAVE;
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
If you also must upgrade your slaves from 3.23 to 4.0, you should first upgrade
your slaves: Shut down each one, upgrade it, and restart it.
Then upgrade the master as just described.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 4.0.0, you can use <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> to set up
a slave. Be aware that <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> currently works only
if all the tables on the master are <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> type. Also, this statement
acquires a
global read lock, so no writes are possible while the tables are being
transferred from the master. When we implement lock-free hot table
backup (in MySQL 5.0), this global read lock will no longer be necessary.

</P>
<P>
Due to these limitations, we recommend that at this point  you use
<CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> only if the dataset on the master is relatively
small, or if a prolonged read lock on the master is acceptable. While the
actual speed of <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> may vary from system to system,
a good rule of thumb for how long it is going to take is 1 second
per 1 MB of the datafile. You will get close to the estimate if both master
and slave are equivalent to 700 MHz Pentium and are connected through a
100 MBit/s network.  Of course, this is only a rough estimate.

</P>
<P>
Once a slave is properly configured and running, it will simply connect
to the master and wait for updates to process. If the master goes away
or the slave loses connectivity with your master, it will keep trying to
connect periodically until it is able to reconnect and resume listening
for updates. The retry interval is controlled by the
<CODE>--master-connect-retry</CODE> option. The default is 60 seconds.

</P>
<P>
Each slave keeps track of where it left off. The master server has no
knowledge of how many slaves there are or which ones are up-to-date at
any given time.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Replication_Implementation_Details" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Implementation_Details">4.10.3  Replication Implementation Details</A></H3>

<P>
Three threads are involved in replication: one on the master and
two on the slave.  When <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> is issued, the I/O thread
is created on the slave. It connects to the master and asks it to
send the queries recorded in its binlogs. Then one thread is created
on the master to send these binlogs.  This thread is identified by
<CODE>Binlog Dump</CODE> in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> output on the master.
The I/O thread reads what the master <CODE>Binlog Dump</CODE> thread
sends and simply copies it to some local files in the slave's data
directory called relay logs.  The last thread, the SQL thread, is
created on the slave; it reads the relay logs and executes the
queries it contains.

</P>
<P>
Note that the master has one thread for each currently connected slave server.

</P>
<P>
With <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> you can know what is happening on the
master and on the slave as regards replication.

</P>
<P>
The following example illustrates how the three threads show up in
<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>.  The output format is that used by <CODE>SHOW
PROCESSLIST</CODE> as of MySQL version 4.0.15, when the content of the
<CODE>State</CODE> column was changed to be more meaningful compared to
earlier versions.

</P>
<P>
On the master server, the output looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     Id: 2
   User: root
   Host: localhost:32931

  State: Has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to be updated
   Info: NULL
</PRE>

<P>
On the slave server, the output looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************

   Info: NULL
</PRE>

<P>
Here thread 2 is on the master. Thread 10 is the I/O thread on the
slave. 
Thread 11 is the SQL thread on the slave; note that the value in the
<CODE>Time</CODE> column can tell how late the slave is compared to the
master (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.9  Replication FAQ</A>).

</P>
<P>
The following list shows
the most common states you will see in the <CODE>State</CODE>
column for the master's <CODE>Binlog Dump</CODE> thread. If you don't see this
thread on a master server, replication is not running.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Sending binlog event to slave</CODE>
<DD>
Binlogs consist of events, where an event is usually a query plus some other
information. The thread has read an event from the binlog and is
sending it to the slave.

<DT><CODE>Finished reading one binlog; switching to next binlog</CODE>
<DD>
The thread has finished reading a binlog file and is opening
the next one to send to the slave.

<DT><CODE>Has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to be updated</CODE>
<DD>
The thread has read all binary log files and is idle. It is waiting for
new events to appear in the binary log as a result of new update queries being
executed on the master.

<DT><CODE>Waiting to finalize termination</CODE>
<DD>
A very brief state that happens as the thread is stopping.

</DL>

<P>
Here are the most common states you will see in the <CODE>State</CODE>
column for the I/O thread of a slave server. Beginning with MySQL 4.1.1, this
state also appears in the <CODE>Slave_IO_State</CODE> column of <CODE>SHOW
SLAVE STATUS</CODE> output. This means that you can get a good view of what is
happening by using only <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Connecting to master</CODE>
<DD>
The thread is attempting to connect to the master.

<DT><CODE>Checking master version</CODE>
<DD>
A very brief state that happens just after the connection to the master is established.

<DT><CODE>Registering slave on master</CODE>
<DD>
A very brief state that happens just after the connection to the master is established.

<DT><CODE>Requesting binlog dump</CODE>
<DD>
A very brief state that happens just after the connection to the master is
established.
The thread sends to the master a request for the contents of its
binlogs, starting from the requested binlog filename and position.

<DT><CODE>Waiting to reconnect after a failed binlog dump request</CODE>
<DD>
If the binlog dump request failed (due to disconnection), the thread goes into
this state while it sleeps. The
thread sleeps for <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> seconds before retrying.

<DT><CODE>Reconnecting after a failed binlog dump request</CODE>
<DD>
Then the thread tries to reconnect to the master.

<DT><CODE>Waiting for master to send event</CODE>
<DD>
The thread has connected and is waiting for binlog events 
to arrive. This can last for a long time if the master is idle. If the
wait lasts for <CODE>slave_read_timeout</CODE> seconds, a timeout will occur.
At that point, the thread will consider the
connection to be broken and make an attempt to reconnect.

<DT><CODE>Queueing master event to the relay log</CODE>
<DD>
The thread has read an event and is copying it to the relay log so the SQL
thread can process it.

<DT><CODE>Waiting to reconnect after a failed master event read</CODE>
<DD>
An error occurred while reading (due to disconnection). The thread is sleeping
for <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> seconds before attempting to reconnect.

<DT><CODE>Reconnecting after a failed master event read</CODE>
<DD>
Then the thread tries to reconnect. When connection is established
again, the state will become <CODE>Waiting for master to send event</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>Waiting for the SQL slave thread to free enough relay log space</CODE>
<DD>
You are using a non-zero <CODE>relay_log_space_limit</CODE> value, and the relay
logs have grown so much that their combined size exceeds this value.
The I/O thread is waiting until the SQL
thread frees enough space by processing relay log contents so that it can
delete some relay log files.

<DT><CODE>Waiting for slave mutex on exit</CODE>
<DD>
A very brief state that happens as the thread is stopping.

</DL>

<P>
Here are the most common states you will see in the <CODE>State</CODE>
column for the SQL thread of a slave server:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Reading event from the relay log</CODE>
<DD>
The thread has read an event from the relay log so that it can process it.

<DT><CODE>Has read all relay log; waiting for the I/O slave thread to update it</CODE>
<DD>
The thread has processed all events in the relay log files and is waiting for
the I/O thread to write new events to the relay log.

<DT><CODE>Waiting for slave mutex on exit</CODE>
<DD>
A very brief state that happens as the thread is stopping.

</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>State</CODE> column for the I/O thread may also show a query string.
This indicates that the thread has read an event from the relay log,
extracted the query from it and is executing the query.

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.0.2, the slave I/O and SQL threads were combined as a single
thread, and no relay log files were used.
The advantage of using two threads is that it separates query reading and
query execution into two independent tasks, so the task of reading queries is
not slowed down if query execution is slow.
For example, if the slave server has not been running for a while, its I/O
thread can quickly fetch all the binlog contents from the master when the
slave starts,
even if the SQL thread lags far behind and may take hours to catch up.
If the slave stops before the SQL thread has executed all the fetched queries,
the I/O thread has at least fetched everything so that
a safe copy of the queries is locally stored in the slave's relay logs for
execution when next the slave starts. This allows the
binlogs to be purged on the master, because it no longer need wait for the
slave to fetch their contents.

</P>
<P>
By default, relay logs are named using filenames of the form
<TT>`host_name-relay-bin.nnn'</TT>, where <CODE>host_name</CODE> is the name of the
slave server host, and <CODE>nnn</CODE> is a sequence number.
Successive relay log files are created using successive sequence numbers,
beginning with <CODE>001</CODE>.
The slave keeps track of relay logs currently in use in an index file.
The default relay log index filename is
<TT>`host_name-relay-bin.index'</TT>.
By default these files are created in the slave's data directory.
The default filenames may be overridden with the <CODE>--relay-log</CODE> and
<CODE>--relay-log-index</CODE> server options.

</P>
<P>
Relay logs have the same format as binary logs, so they can be read
with <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>.
A relay log is automatically deleted by the SQL thread as soon as it
no longer needs it (that is, as soon as it has executed all its
events). There is no command to delete relay logs, because
the SQL thread takes care of doing so. However, from MySQL 4.0.14,
<CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> rotates relay logs, which will influence when
the SQL thread deletes them.

</P>
<P>
A new relay log is created under the following conditions:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The first time the I/O thread starts after the slave server starts.
(In MySQL 5.0, a new relay log will be created each time the I/O thread
starts, not just the first time.)

<LI>

A <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> statement is issued (4.0.14 and up only).

<LI>

The size of the current relay log file becomes too big. The meaning of
``too big'' is determined as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE>, if <CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE> &#62; 0
<LI>

<CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>, if <CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE> = 0
or MySQL is older than 4.0.14
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
A slave replication server
creates additional two small files in the data directory.
These files are named <TT>`master.info'</TT> and <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT> by default.
They contain information like that shown in the output of the <CODE>SHOW SLAVE
STATUS</CODE> statement (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Slave_SQL">4.10.8  SQL Statements for Controlling Slave Servers</A> for a description of this command).
As disk files they survive slave's shutdown. The next time the slave starts
up, it can read these files to know how far it has proceeded in
reading binlogs from the master and in processing its own relay logs.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`master.info'</TT> file is updated by the I/O thread.
The correspondance between the lines in the file and the
columns displayed by <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> is as follows:

</P>

<P>
When you back up your slave's data, you should back up these 2 small files
as well, along with the relay log files. because they are needed to resume
replication after you restore the slave's data.  If you lose the relay logs
but still have the <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT> file, you can check it to determine
how far the SQL thread has executed in the master binlogs. Then you can use
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> with the <CODE>MASTER_RELAY_LOG</CODE> and
<CODE>MASTER_RELAY_POS</CODE> options to tell the slave to re-read the binlogs from
that point.  This requires that the binlogs still exist on the master server,
of course.

</P>
<P>
If your slave is subject to replicating <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> statements, you should also backup the <TT>`SQL-LOAD*'</TT> files
that may exist in the directory that the slave uses for this purpose.
The slave needs these files to resume
replication of any interrupted <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statements. 
(The directory location is specified using the <TT>`--slave-load-tmpdir'</TT>
option.  Its default value if not specified is the value of the <CODE>tmpdir</CODE>
variable.)

<H3><A NAME="Replication_HOWTO" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_HOWTO">4.10.4  How to Set Up Replication</A></H3>

<P>
Here is a quick description of how to set up complete replication on
your current MySQL server. It assumes you want to replicate all
your databases and have not configured replication before. You will need
to shut down your master server briefly to complete the steps outlined
here.

</P>
<P>
The procedure is written in terms of setting up a single slave, but you can
use it to set up multiple slaves.

</P>
<P>
While this method is the most straightforward way to set up a slave,
it is not the only one. For example, if you already have a snapshot
of the master's data, and
the master already has its server ID set and binary logging enabled, you can
set up a slave without shutting down the master or even blocking updates to it.
For more details, please see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.9  Replication FAQ</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you want to administer a MySQL replication setup, we
suggest that you
read this entire chapter through and try all commands
mentioned in section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Master_SQL">4.10.7  SQL Statements for Controlling Master Servers</A> ans section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Slave_SQL">4.10.8  SQL Statements for Controlling Slave Servers</A>.
You should also familiarise yourself
with replication startup options in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Options">4.10.6  Replication Startup Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that this procedure and some of the replication SQL statements
in later sections refer to the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege. Prior to MySQL
4.0.2, use the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege instead.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make sure you have a recent version of MySQL installed on the master
and slave(s), and that these versions are compatible according to the table
shown in section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Implementation">4.10.2  Replication Implementation Overview</A>.

Please do not report bugs until you have verified that the problem is present
in the latest release.

<LI>

Set up an account on the master server that the slave server can use to
connnect. This account must be given the <CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE> privilege.
(If MySQL versions older than 4.0.2, give the account the <CODE>FILE</CODE>
privilege instead.)
If the account is only for replication
(which is recommended), you don't need to grant any additional privileges.

The hostname in the account name should be such that each of the slave servers
can use the account to connect to the master.
For example, to create a user named <CODE>repl</CODE> which can access your
master from any host, you might use this command:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO repl@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '&#60;password&#62;';
</PRE>

For MySQL versions older than 4.0.2, use this command instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT FILE ON *.* TO repl@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '&#60;password&#62;';
</PRE>

If you plan to use the <CODE>LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER</CODE> or <CODE>LOAD DATA
FROM MASTER</CODE> statements from the slave host, you will need to grant this
account additional privileges:


<UL>

<LI>

Grant to the account the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> and <CODE>RELOAD</CODE> global privileges.

<LI>

Grant the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege for all tables that
you want to load. Any master tables from which the account cannot
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> will be ignored by <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI>

If you are using MyISAM tables, flush all the tables and block write queries
by executing <CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE> command.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
</PRE>

and then take a snapshot of the data on your master server.

The easiest way to create a snapshot is to simply use an archiving program
(<CODE>tar</CODE> on Unix, <CODE>PowerArchiver</CODE>, <CODE>WinRAR</CODE>,
<CODE>WinZIP</CODE> or any similar software on Windows) to
produce an archive of the databases in your master's data directory. 
For example, to use <CODE>tar</CODE> to create an archive that includes all
databases, change location into the master server's data directory, then
execute this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar .
</PRE>

If you want the archive to include only a database called <CODE>this_db</CODE>, use
this command instead:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar ./this_db
</PRE>

Then copy the archive file to the <TT>`/tmp'</TT> directory on the slave server
host. On that machine, change location into the slave's data directory, and
unpack the archive file using this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tar -xvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar
</PRE>

You may not want to replicate the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database. If not, you can
exclude it from the archive. You also need not include any log files in the
archive, or the <TT>`master.info'</TT> or <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT> files.

While the read lock placed by <CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE> is in effect,
read the value of the current binary log name and offset on the master:


<PRE>
mysql &#62; SHOW MASTER STATUS;
+---------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File          | Position | Binlog_do_db | Binlog_ignore_db |
+---------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| mysql-bin.003 | 73       | test,bar     | foo,manual,mysql |
+---------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
</PRE>

The <CODE>File</CODE> column shows the name of the log,  while <CODE>Position</CODE> shows
the offset. In the above example, the binary log value is
<CODE>mysql-bin.003</CODE> and the offset is 73. Record the values. You will need
to use them later when you are setting up the slave.

Once you have taken the snapshot and recorded the log name and offset, you can
re-enable write activity on the master:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

If you are using InnoDB tables, ideally you should use the InnoDB Hot Backup
tool that is available to those who purchase MySQL commercial licenses,
support, or the backup tool itself. It takes a consistent snapshot
without acquiring any locks on the master server, and records the log name and
offset corresponding to the snapshot to be later used on the slave. More
information about the tool is avalaible at
<a HREF="http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html">http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html</a>.

Without the Hot Backup tool, the quickest way to take a snapshot of  InnoDB
tables is to shut down the master server and copy the InnoDB datafiles
and logs,
and the table definition files (<CODE>.frm</CODE>). To record the current log file
name and offset, you should do the following before you shut down the server:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql&#62; SHOW MASTER STATUS;
</PRE>

And then record the log name and the offset from the output of
<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> as was shown earlier. Once you have recorded the
log name and the offset, shut down the server without unlocking the tables to
make sure it goes down with the snapshot corresponding to the current log file
and offset:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -uroot shutdown
</PRE>

An alternative for both MyISAM and InnoDB tables
is to take an SQL dump of the master instead of a binary
copy like above; for this you can use <CODE>mysqldump --master-data</CODE>
on your master and later run this SQL dump into your slave. However, this is
slower than doing a binary copy.

If the master has been previously running without <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> enabled,
the log name and position values displayed by <CODE>SHOW MASTER
STATUS</CODE> or <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will be empty. In that case, record empty 
string ('') for the log name, and 4 for the offset.

<LI>

Make sure the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section of the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file on the
master host includes a <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option. The section should also have a
<CODE>server-id=master_id</CODE> option, where <CODE>master_id</CODE> must be an integer
value from 1 to 2^32 - 1. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
log-bin
server-id=1
</PRE>

If those options are not present, add them and restart the server.

<LI>

Stop the server that is to be used as a slave server and add the following to
its <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
server-id=slave_id
</PRE>

The <CODE>slave_id</CODE> value, like the <CODE>master_id</CODE> value, must
be an integer value from 1 to 2^32 - 1. In addition, it is very
important that the ID of the slave be different than the ID of the
master. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
server-id=2
</PRE>

If you are setting up multiple slaves, each one must have
a <CODE>server-id</CODE> value that differs from that of the master and
from each of the other slaves.  Think of <CODE>server-id</CODE> values
as something similar to IP addresses: These IDs uniquely identify
each server instance in the community of replication partners.

If you don't specify a <CODE>server-id</CODE> value, it will be set to 1 if
you have not defined <CODE>master-host</CODE>, else it will be set to 2. Note
that in the case of <CODE>server-id</CODE> omission, a master will refuse
connections from all slaves, and a slave will refuse to connect to a
master. Thus, omitting <CODE>server-id</CODE> is only good for backup with a
binary log.

<LI>

If you made a binary backup of the master server's data, copy it to the slave
server's data directory before starting the slave.
Make sure that the privileges on
the files and directories are correct. The user which MySQL runs
as needs to be able to read from and write to them, just as on the
master.

If you made a backup using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, start the slave first (see next
step).

<LI>

Start the slave server. If it has been replicating previously,
start the slave server with the <CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> option.
You also may want to start the slave server with the
<CODE>--log-warnings</CODE> option. That way, you will get more messages about
problems (for example, network or connection problems).

<LI>

If you made a backup of the master server's data using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, load
the dump file into the slave server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root -p &#60; dump_file.sql
</PRE>

<LI>

Execute the following command on the slave, replacing the values within
<CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE> with the actual values relevant to your system:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CHANGE MASTER TO
    -&#62;     MASTER_HOST='&#60;master host name&#62;',
    -&#62;     MASTER_USER='&#60;replication user name&#62;',
    -&#62;     MASTER_PASSWORD='&#60;replication password&#62;',
    -&#62;     MASTER_LOG_FILE='&#60;recorded log file name&#62;',
    -&#62;     MASTER_LOG_POS=&#60;recorded log offset&#62;;
</PRE>

The following table lists the maximum string length for these variables:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>MASTER_HOST</CODE> </TD><TD> 60
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MASTER_USER</CODE> </TD><TD> 16

<LI>

Start the slave threads:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; START SLAVE; 
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
After you have performed this procedure, the slave should connect to the master
and catch up on any updates that have occurred since the snapshot was taken.

</P>
<P>
If you have forgotten to set <CODE>server-id</CODE> for the master, slaves will
not be able to connect to it.

</P>
<P>
If you have forgotten to set <CODE>server-id</CODE> for the slave, you will get
the following error in its error log:

</P>

<PRE>
Warning: one should set server_id to a non-0 value if master_host is set.
The server will not act as a slave.
</PRE>

<P>
You will also find error messages in the slave's error log if it
is not able to replicate for any other reason.

</P>
<P>
Once a slave is replicating, you will find in its data directory one file called
<TT>`master.info'</TT> and another called <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT>.
The slave uses these two files to keep track of how much
of the master's binary log it has processed. <STRONG>Do not</STRONG> remove or
edit these files, unless you really know what you are doing and understand
the implications. Even in that case,
it is preferred that you use <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command.

Once you have a snapshot, you can use it to set up other slaves by
following the slave portion of the procedure just described. You do not need to
take another snapshot of the master.

<A NAME="IDX838"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is an explanation of what is supported and what is not:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Replication will be done correctly with <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values.
<LI>

The <CODE>USER()</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD_FILE()</CODE> functions
are replicated without changes and will thus not work reliably on the
slave. This is also true for <CODE>CONNECTION_ID()</CODE> in slave versions
older than 4.1.1.
The <STRONG>new</STRONG> <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function in MySQL 4.1, is well
replicated since 4.1.1 masters; your slaves must be 4.1.0 or above
to replicate it. If you have older slaves and need to replicate
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> from your 4.1.x master, you must start your master
with option <CODE>--old-password</CODE>.
<LI>

The <CODE>sql_mode</CODE>, <CODE>FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS</CODE>, and <CODE>table_type</CODE>
variables are not replicated.
<LI>

You must use the same character set (<CODE>--default-character-set</CODE>)
on the master and the slave. Otherwise, you may get duplicate key errors on
the slave, because a key that is regarded as unique in the master character
set may not be unique in the slave character set.
<LI>

If you are using transactional tables on the master and non-transactional
tables (for the same tables) on the slave, you will get problems if
the slave is stopped in the middle of a <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT</CODE> block, as
the slave will later start at the beginning of the <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> block.
This issue is on our TODO and will be fixed in the near future.
<LI>

Update queries that use user variables are badly replicated in
3.23 and 4.0. This is fixed in 4.1. Note that user variable names
are case insensitive starting from version 5.0, so you should take
this into account when setting up replication between 5.0 and a
previous version.
<LI>

The slave can connect to the master using SSL, if the master and slave
are both 4.1.1 or newer.

<LI>

Though we have never heard of it actually occurring, it is theoretically
possible for the data on the master and slave to become different if a
query is designed in such a way that the data modification is
non-deterministic, that is, left to the will of the query optimiser (which
generally is not a good practice, even outside of replication!).
For a detailed explanation, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Open_bugs">1.7.6.2  Open Bugs / Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Before MySQL 4.1.1,
<CODE>FLUSH</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> commands
are not stored in the binary log and thus are
not replicated to the slaves. This is not normally a problem as
these commands don't change anything. However, it does mean that if you
update the MySQL privilege tables directly without using the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement and you replicate the <CODE>mysql</CODE> privilege
database, you must do a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> on your slaves to put
the new privileges into effect. Also if you use
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> when renaming a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table involved in a
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you will have to issue <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>
manually on the slave.
Since MySQL 4.1.1, these commands are written to the binary log
(except <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>, <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>, <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE>,
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>) unless you specify
<CODE>NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG</CODE> (or its alias <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>).
For a syntax example, see section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

MySQL only supports one master and many slaves. Later we will
add a voting algorithm to automatically change master if something goes
wrong with the current master. We will also introduce ``agent'' processes
to help do load balancing by sending <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries to different
slaves.
<LI>

Temporary tables are replicated with the exception of the case
that you shut down slave server (not just slave thread) and you have some
replicated temporary tables that are used in update statements that
have not yet been executed on the slave.  (If you shut down the slave, the
temporary tables needed by those updates no longer are available when the
slave starts again.)
To avoid this problem, do not shut down the slave while it has temporary
tables open. Instead, use this procedure:


<OL>

<LI>

Issue a <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

Use <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE> to check the value of the <CODE>Slave_open_temp_tables</CODE>
variable.

<LI>

If the value is 0, issue a <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> command to
shut down the slave.

<LI>

If the value is not 0, restart the slave threads with <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>.

<LI>

Repeat the procedure later to see if you have better luck next time.

</OL>

We have plans to fix this problem in the near future.

<LI>

It is safe to connect servers in a circular
master/slave relationship with <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> enabled.
Note, however, that many queries will not work correctly in this kind of
setup unless your client code is written to take care of the potential
problems that can happen from updates that occur in different sequence
on different servers.

This means that you can do a setup like the following:


<PRE>
A -&#62; B -&#62; C -&#62; A
</PRE>

Server IDs are encoded in the binary log events.  A will know when
an event it reads had originally been created by A, so A will not
execute it and there will be no infinite loop.  But this circular
setup will work only if you only if you perform no conflicting
updates between the tables.  In other words, if you insert data in
A and C, you should never insert a row in A that may have a
conflicting key with a row insert in C.  You should also not update
the same rows on two servers if the order in which the updates are
applied matters.
<LI>

If a query on the slave gets an error, the slave SQL thread will
terminate, and a message will appear in the slave error log. You should
then connect to the slave manually, fix the cause of the error (for
example, non-existent table), and then run <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>.
<LI>

If the connection to the master is lost, the slave will try to reconnect
immediately. If that fails, the slave will retry
every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> seconds (default
60). Because of this, it is safe to shut down the master, and
then restart it after a while. The slave will also be able to deal with
network connectivity outages. However, the slave will notice the
network outage only after receiving no data from the master for
<CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE> seconds. So if your outages are short, you may want
to decrease <CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

Shutting down the slave (cleanly) is also safe, as it keeps track of
where it left off.  Unclean shutdowns might produce problems, especially
if disk cache was not synced before the system died. Your system fault
tolerance will be greatly increased if you have a good UPS.
<LI>

Due to the non-transactional nature of MyISAM tables, it is possible to have
a query that will only partially update a table and return an error code. This
can happen, for example, on a multi-row insert that has one row violating a
key constraint, or if a long update query is killed after updating some of the
rows. If that happens on the master, the slave thread will exit and wait for
the DBA to decide what to do about it unless the error code is legitimate and
the query execution results in the same error code. If this error code
validation behaviour is not desirable, some (or all) errors can be masked
out (ignored) with the <CODE>--slave-skip-errors</CODE> option.
This option is available starting with MySQL Version 3.23.47.
<LI>

If you update transactional tables from non-transactional tables inside a
<CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT</CODE> segment, updates to the binary log may be out of sync
if some thread changes the non-transactional table before the
transaction commits.  This is because the transaction is written to the
binary log only when it's commited.
<LI>

Before version 4.0.15, any update to a non-transactional table is
written to the binary log at once when the update is made while
transactional updates are written on <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> or not written at
all if you use <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>; you have to take this into account
when updating both transactional tables and non-transactional tables
in the same transaction if you are using binary logging for backups or
replication. In version 4.0.15, we changed the logging behaviour
for transactions that mix updates to transactional and
non-transactional tables, which solves the problems (order of queries
is good in binlog, and all needed queries are written to the binlog
even in case of <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>). The problem which remains is when a
second connection updates the non-transactional table while the first
connection's transaction is not finished yet (wrong order can still
occur, because the second connection's update will be written
immediately after it is done).
</UL>

<P>
The following table lists problems in MySQL 3.23 that are fixed in MySQL 4.0:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is handled properly, as long as the data file
still resides on the master server at the time of update
propagation.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD LOCAL DATA INFILE</CODE> will be skipped.
<LI>

In 3.23 <CODE>RAND()</CODE> in updates does not replicate properly.
Use <CODE>RAND(some_non_rand_expr)</CODE> if you are replicating updates with
<CODE>RAND()</CODE>. You can, for example, use <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> for the
argument to <CODE>RAND()</CODE>. This is fixed in 4.0.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Options" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Options">4.10.6  Replication Startup Options</A></H3>

<P>
On both the master and the slave you need to use the <CODE>server-id</CODE> option
to establish a unique replication ID for each server. You should pick a unique
integer in the
range from 1 to 2^32 - 1 for each master and slave.
Example: <CODE>server-id=3</CODE>

</P>
<P>
The options that you can use on the master server for controlling binary
logging are all described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following table describes the options you can use on slave servers.
You can specify them on the command line or in an option file.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Replication handles the following options in a special way:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>--master-host</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-user</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-password</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-port</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-connect-retry</CODE>

</UL>

<P>
If no <TT>`master.info'</TT> file exists when the slave server starts,
it uses values for those options that are specified in option files
or on the command line.  This will occur when you start the server
as a replication slave for the very first time, or you have run
<CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE> and shut down and restarted the slave server.

</P>
<P>
However, if the <TT>`master.info'</TT> file exists when the slave server
starts, it uses the values in the file and <STRONG>IGNORES</STRONG> any
values specified for those options in option files or on the command
line.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you specify this option in your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
master-host=this_host
</PRE>

<P>
The first time you start the server as a replication slave, it will
read and use that option from the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file.  The server
will then record that value in the <TT>`master.info'</TT> file.  The
next time you start the server, it will read the master host value
from the <TT>`master.info'</TT> file only.  If you modify the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file to specify a different master host, it will have no effect.
You must use <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.1.1, the following options also are handled specially:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>--master-ssl</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-ssl-ca</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-ssl-capath</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-ssl-cert</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-ssl-cipher</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--master-ssl-key</CODE>

</UL>

<P>
The <TT>`master.info'</TT> file includes the values corresponding to those
options. In addition, the 4.1.1 file format includes as its first line
the number of lines in the file. If you upgrade an older server to 4.1.1,
the <TT>`master.info'</TT> will be upgraded to the new format automatically when
the new server starts. (If you downgrade a 4.1.1 or newer server to a version
older than 4.1.1, you should manually remove the first line before starting
the older server for the first time.)

</P>
<P>
Because the server gives an existing <TT>`master.info'</TT> file precedence
over the startup options just described, you might prefer not to use startup
options for these values at all, and instead specify them by using the
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> statement.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHANGE_MASTER_TO">4.10.8.1  <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
This example shows a more extensive use of startup options to configure a
slave server:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
server-id=2
master-host=db-master.mycompany.com
master-port=3306
master-user=pertinax
master-password=freitag
master-connect-retry=60
report-host=db-slave.mycompany.com
</PRE>

<P>
The following list describes startup options for controlling replication:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave to log the updates performed by its SQL thread to the
slave's own binary log. Off by default.
Of course, for this option to have any effect, the slave must be started with
binary logging enabled (<CODE>--log-bin</CODE> option).
<CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE> is used when you want to chain replication servers.
For example, you might want a setup like this:


<PRE>
A -&#62; B -&#62; C
</PRE>

That is, A serves as the master for the slave B, and B serves as the master
for the slave C. For this to work, where B is both a master and a slave,
you must start B with the <CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE> option.
A and B must both be started with binary logging enabled.

<DT><CODE>--log-warnings</CODE>
<DD>
Makes the slave print more messages about what it is doing. For
example, it will warn you that it succeeded in reconnecting after a
network/connection failure, and warn you about how each slave thread started.

This option is not limited to replication use only. It produces warnings
across a spectrum of server activities.

<DT><CODE>--master-host=host</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the hostname or IP address of the master replication server.
If this option is not given, the slave
thread will not be started.  The value in <TT>`master.info'</TT>
takes precedence if it can be read.
Probably a better name for this options would have been something like
<CODE>--bootstrap-master-host</CODE>, but it is too late to change now.

<DT><CODE>--master-user=username</CODE>
<DD>
The username of the account that the slave thread uses for authentication when
connecting to the master. The account must have the
<CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE> privilege (prior to MySQL 4.0.2, it must have the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege instead). If the master user
is not set, user <CODE>test</CODE> is assumed. The value in <TT>`master.info'</TT>
takes precedence if it can be read.

<DT><CODE>--master-password=password</CODE>
<DD>
The password of the account that the slave thread uses for authentication when
connecting to the master.
If not set, an empty password is assumed. The value in
<TT>`master.info'</TT> takes precedence if it can be read.

<DT><CODE>--master-port=port_number</CODE>
<DD>
The port the master is listening on. If not set, the compiled setting of
<CODE>MYSQL_PORT</CODE> is assumed. If you have not tinkered with
<CODE>configure</CODE> options, this should be 3306. The value in
<TT>`master.info'</TT> takes precedence if it can be read.

<DT><CODE>--master-connect-retry=seconds</CODE>
<DD>
The number of seconds the slave thread sleeps before retrying to
connect to the master in case the master goes down or the connection is
lost.  Default is 60. The value in <TT>`master.info'</TT>
takes precedence if it can be read.

<DT><CODE>--master-info-file=filename</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the name to use for the file in which the slave records
information about the master.
The default name is <TT>`mysql.info'</TT> in the data directory.

<DT><CODE>--master-ssl</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--master-ssl-ca=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--master-ssl-capath=directory_name</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--master-ssl-cert=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--master-ssl-cipher=cipher_list</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--master-ssl-key=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
These options are used for setting up a secure replication connection to
the master server using SSL.
Their meanings are the same as the corresponding
<CODE>--ssl</CODE>,
<CODE>--ssl-ca</CODE>,
<CODE>--ssl-capath</CODE>,
<CODE>--ssl-cert</CODE>,
<CODE>--ssl-cipher</CODE>,
<CODE>--ssl-key</CODE>
options described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#SSL_options">4.3.10.5  SSL Command-line Options</A>.

These options are operational as of MySQL 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>--max-relay-log-size=#</CODE>
<DD>
To rotate the relay log automatically.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>--relay-log=filename</CODE>
<DD>
To specify the location and name that should be used for relay logs.
You can use this to have hostname-independant relay log names, or if
your relay logs tend to be big (and you don't want to decrease
<CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE>) and you need to put them on some area
different from the data directory, or if you want to increase speed by
balancing load between disks.

<DT><CODE>--relay-log-index=filename</CODE>
<DD>
To specify the location and name that should be used for the relay
logs index file.

<DT><CODE>--relay-log-info-file=filename</CODE>
<DD>
To give <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT> another name and/or to put it in another
directory than the data directory.

<DT><CODE>--relay-log-purge=0|1</CODE>
<DD>
Disables/enables automatic purging of relay logs as soon as they are
not needed any more. This is a global variable that can be dynamically
changed with <CODE>SET GLOBAL RELAY_LOG_PURGE=0|1</CODE>. The default value
is 1.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>--relay-log-space-limit=#</CODE>
<DD>
To put an upper limit on the total size of all relay logs on the
slave (a value of 0 means ``unlimited''). This is useful
if you have a small hard disk on your slave machine. When the limit is
reached, the I/O thread pauses (does not read the master's binlog)
until the SQL thread has caught up and deleted some now unused relay
logs. Note that this limit is not absolute: there are cases where the
SQL thread needs more events to be able to delete; in that case the I/O
thread will overgo the limit until deletion becomes possible. Not
doing so would cause a deadlock (which happens before MySQL 4.0.13).
Users should not set <CODE>--relay-log-space-limit</CODE> to less than twice
the value of <CODE>--max-relay-log-size</CODE> (or <CODE>--max-binlog-size</CODE> if
<CODE>--max-relay-log-size</CODE> is 0) because in that case there are
chances that when the I/O thread waits for free space because
<CODE>--relay-log-space-limit</CODE> is exceeded, the SQL thread has no relay
log to purge and so cannot satisfy the I/O thread, forcing the I/O
thread to temporarily ignore <CODE>--relay-log-space-limit</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--replicate-do-table=db_name.table_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the specified table.
To specify more than one table, use the directive multiple times, once
for each table.  This will work for cross-database updates, in
contrast to <CODE>--replicate-do-db</CODE>. 
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

<DT><CODE>--replicate-ignore-table=db_name.table_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate any command that updates the
specified table (even if any other tables may be update by the same
command). To specify more than one table to ignore, use the directive
multiple times, once for each table. This will work for cross-database
updates, in contrast to <CODE>--replicate-ignore-db</CODE>.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

<DT><CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.table_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to queries where any of
the updated tables match the specified wildcard pattern.  To specify
more than one table, use the directive multiple times, once for each
table.  This will work for cross-database updates.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

Example: <CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%</CODE> will replicate only
updates that uses a table in any databases that start with <CODE>foo</CODE>
and whose table names start with <CODE>bar</CODE>.

Note that if you do <CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.%</CODE> then the rule
will be propagated to <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>,
that is, these two statements will be replicated if the database name
matches the database pattern (<CODE>foo%</CODE> here) (this magic is triggered by
<CODE>%</CODE> being the table pattern).

<DT><CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.table_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate a query where any table matches the
given wildcard pattern. To specify more than one table to ignore, use
the directive multiple times, once for each table. This will work for
cross-database updates.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

Example: <CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%</CODE> will not do updates
to tables in databases that start with <CODE>foo</CODE> and whose table names start
with <CODE>bar</CODE>.

Note that if you do <CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.%</CODE> then the
rule will be propagated to <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP
DATABASE</CODE>, that is, these two statements will not be replicated if the
database name matches the database pattern (<CODE>foo%</CODE> here) (this magic is
triggered by <CODE>%</CODE> being the table pattern).

<DT><CODE>--replicate-do-db=database_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave to restrict replication to commands where
the current database (that is, the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
is <CODE>database_name</CODE>.
To specify more than one database, use the directive multiple
times, once for each database. Note that this will not replicate
cross-database queries such as <CODE>UPDATE some_db.some_table
SET foo='bar'</CODE> while having selected a different or no database. If you
need cross database updates to work, make sure you have 3.23.28 or
later, and use <CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%</CODE>.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

Example of what does not work as you could expect it: if the slave is
started with <CODE>--replicate-do-db=sales</CODE>, and you do
<CODE>USE prices; UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</CODE>,
this query will not be replicated.

If you need cross database updates to work, 
use <CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%</CODE> instead.

The main reason for this ``just-check-the-current-database''
behaviour is that it's hard from the command
alone to know if a query should be replicated or not; for example if you
are using multi-table-delete or multi-table-update commands
that go across multiple databases.  It's also very fast to just check
the current database.

<DT><CODE>--replicate-ignore-db=database_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave to not replicate any command where the current
database (that is, the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
is <CODE>database_name</CODE>. To specify more than one database to
ignore, use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
You should not use this directive if you are using cross table updates
and you don't want these update to be replicated.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

Example of what does not work as you could expect it: if the slave is
started with <CODE>--replicate-ignore-db=sales</CODE>, and you do
<CODE>USE prices; UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</CODE>,
this query will be replicated.

If you need cross database updates to work, 
use <CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%</CODE> instead.

<DT><CODE>--replicate-rewrite-db=from_name-&#62;to_name</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave to translate the current database
(that is, the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
to <CODE>to_name</CODE> if it was <CODE>from_name</CODE> on the master.
Only statements involving tables may be affected
(<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE>, <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> won't),
and only if <CODE>from_name</CODE> was the current database on the master.
This will not work for cross-database updates.
Note that the translation is done before <CODE>--replicate-*</CODE>
rules are tested.

Example: <CODE>replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name-&#62;slave_db_name</CODE>

<DT><CODE>--report-host=host</CODE>
<DD>
The hostname or IP number of the slave to be reported to
the master during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE HOSTS</CODE>. Leave unset if you do not want the slave to
register itself with the master. Note that it is not sufficient for the
master to simply read the IP number of the slave from the TCP/IP socket once the slave
connects. Due to <CODE>NAT</CODE> and other routing issues, that IP may not be
valid for connecting to the slave from the master or other hosts.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.0.0.

<DT><CODE>--report-port=port_number</CODE>
<DD>
Port for connecting to slave reported to the
master during slave registration.  Set it only if the slave is listening
on a non-default port or if you have a special tunnel from the master or
other clients to the slave. If not sure, leave this option unset.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.0.0.

<DT><CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave server not to start the slave threads on server startup. The user
can start them later with <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--slave_compressed_protocol=#</CODE>
<DD>
If 1, then use compression on the slave/client protocol if both
slave and master support this.

<DT><CODE>--slave-load-tmpdir=filename</CODE>
<DD>
This option is by default equal to the value of the <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> variable.
When the slave SQL thread replicates a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command, it
extracts the to-be-loaded file from the relay log into temporary files,
then loads these into the table. If the file loaded on the master was
huge, the temporary files on the slave will be huge, too; therefore you
may wish/have to tell the slave to put the temporary files on some
large disk different from <CODE>tmpdir</CODE>, using this option. In
that case, you may also use the <CODE>--relay-log</CODE> option,
as relay logs will be huge, too.
<CODE>--slave-load-tmpdir</CODE> should point to a disk-based filesystem; not a
memory-based one. Because the slave needs the
temporary files used to replicate <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>) to survive a
machine's reboot.

<DT><CODE>--slave-net-timeout=#</CODE>
<DD>
Number of seconds to wait for more data from the master before aborting
the read, considering the connection broken and retrying to connect. The first
retry occurs immediately after timeout. The interval between retries is
controlled by the <CODE>--master-connect-retry</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>--slave-skip-errors= [err_code1,err_code2,... | all]</CODE>
<DD>
Tells the slave SQL thread to continue
replication when a query returns an error from the provided
list. Normally, replication will discontinue when an error is
encountered, giving the user a chance to resolve the inconsistency in the
data manually. Do not use this option unless you fully understand why
you are getting the errors.  If there are no bugs in your
replication setup and client programs, and no bugs in MySQL itself, you
should never get an abort with error. Indiscriminate use of this option
will result in slaves being hopelessly out of sync with the master and
you having no idea how the problem happened.

For error codes, you should use the numbers provided by the error message in
your slave error log and in the output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. A full list
of error messages can be found in the source distribution in
<TT>`Docs/mysqld_error.txt'</TT>.
The server error codes also are listed at section <A HREF="manual.html#Error-returns">12.1  Error Returns</A>.

You can (but should not) also use a very non-recommended value of <CODE>all</CODE>
which will ignore all error messages and keep barging along regardless.
Needless to say, if you use it, we make no promises regarding your data
integrity. Please do not complain if your data on the slave is not anywhere
close to what it is on the master in this case -- you have been warned.

Examples:


<PRE>
--slave-skip-errors=1062,1053
--slave-skip-errors=all
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
Some of these options, like all <CODE>--replicate-*</CODE> options, can only
be set at the slave server's startup, not on-the-fly. We plan to fix this.

</P>
<P>
Here is the order of evaluation of the <CODE>r--eplicate-*</CODE> rules, to
decide if the query is going to be executed by the slave or ignored by
it:

<OL>
<LI>

Are there some <CODE>--replicate-do-db</CODE> or <CODE>--replicate-ignore-db</CODE>

<UL>
<LI>ignore the query:

<LI>execute the query:

don't execute it immediately, defer the decision, go to step below.

</UL>

<LI>

Are there some <CODE>--replicate-*-table</CODE> rules?

<UL>

updated (multi-table statement),
the first matching table (matching ``do'' or ``ignore'') wins
(that is, the first table is compared to rules, then if no decision could
be taken the second table is compared to rules, etc).

</PRE>

<P>
Deletes all the binary logs listed in the log
index that are strictly prior to the specified log or date.
The logs also are removed from this list recorded in the log index file,

<P>
If you have an active slave that is currently reading one of the logs you
are trying to delete, this command does nothing and fails with an error.
However, if you have a dormant slave, and happen to purge one of
the logs it wants to read, the slave will be unable to replicate once it
comes up.  The command is safe to run while slaves are replicating. You
do not need to stop them.

</P>

<P>
You must first check all the slaves with <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> to
see which log they are reading, then do a listing of the logs on the
master with <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>, find the earliest log among all
the slaves (if all the slaves are up to date, this will be the
last log on the list), backup all the logs you are about to delete
(optional) and purge up to the target log.

For example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CHANGE MASTER TO

    -&#62;     RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;
</PRE>

<P>
You need to specify only the values that you want to change. The values that
you omit will stay the same, with the exception that if you specify
the master host or port,
the slave will assume that the master server is different than
before. (This is true even if you specify a host or port value value that is
the same as the current value.) In this case, the
old values of master binlog name and position are considered no longer
applicable, so if you do not specify <CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE</CODE> and
<CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE> in the command, <CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE=''</CODE> and
<CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS=4</CODE> are silently appended to it.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE</CODE> and <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE> are the coordinates
at which the slave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the
next time the thread starts. Because <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> deletes
relay logs (see below), these are also the coordinates from which the
slave SQL thread will begin executing the next time it starts.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> <STRONG>deletes all relay logs</STRONG> (and starts
a new one), unless you specified <CODE>RELAY_LOG_FILE</CODE> or
<CODE>RELAY_LOG_POS</CODE> (in that case relay logs will be kept;
since MySQL 4.1.1 the <CODE>RELAY_LOG_PURGE</CODE> global variable
will silently be set to 0).
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> updates <TT>`master.info'</TT> and
<TT>`relay-log.info'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG>
If the slave SQL thread is late by one or more queries compared to the
I/O thread just before you issue <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE>
(a very common case when replication is running in high-load environments),
then as <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> deletes relay logs containing these
non-executed queries, and so replication then restarts <STRONG>from the
coordinates of the I/O thread</STRONG>, <STRONG>the SQL thread
will have ``leapt'' over the non-executed queries</STRONG>.
Therefore, unless these queries were not important, you should do one of the
following before
issuing <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Ensure that the slave SQL thread has read all existing relay logs.
You can achieve this by stopping only the slave I/O thread (<CODE>STOP SLAVE
IO_THREAD</CODE>), then monitoring the progress of the running slave SQL
thread with <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT
MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE>, until it has caught up. This way there will be no
leap for the slave SQL thread.

<LI>

Run <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>, check where the slave SQL thread is in the
master's binlog (using <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>, columns 
<CODE>Relay_Master_Log_File</CODE> and <CODE>Exec_master_log_pos</CODE>), and 
add a specification of these coordinates
to the <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> command (<CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE=...,
MASTER_LOG_POS=...</CODE>).
This way, you will instruct the
slave I/O thread to start replication from the former coordinates of
the slave SQL thread, so there will be no leap for the slave SQL thread.
</UL>

<P>
If you don't take care of this issue, even a simple <CODE>STOP SLAVE; CHANGE
MASTER TO MASTER_USER='repl'; START SLAVE;</CODE> run in the middle of a highly-loaded
replication could break this replication and spoil the slave's data.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> is useful for setting up a slave when you have the snapshot of
the master and have recorded the log and the offset on the master that the
snapshot corresponds to. You can run
 <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',
 MASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master</CODE> on the slave after restoring the
snapshot.

</P>
<P>
The first example above 
(<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com' etc</CODE>)
changes the master and master's binlog
coordinates. This is when you want the slave to replicate the master.
The second example, less frequently used, is when the slave has relay logs which, for some
reason, you want the slave to execute again; to do this the master
needn't be reachable, you just have to do <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE>
and start the SQL thread (<CODE>START SLAVE SQL_THREAD</CODE>). 
You can even use this out of a replication setup, on a standalone,
slave-of-nobody server, to recover after a crash.
Suppose your server has crashed and you have restored a backup. 
You want to replay the server's own binlogs (not relay logs, but regular binary
logs), supposedly named <TT>`myhost-bin.*'</TT>. First make a backup copy of
these binlogs in some safe place, in case you don't exactly follow the
procedure below and accidentally have the server purge the binlogs.
If using MySQL 4.1.1 or newer, do <CODE>SET GLOBAL RELAY_LOG_PURGE=0</CODE> for additional safety.
Then start the server without <CODE>log-bin</CODE>, with a new
(different from before) server ID, with <CODE>relay-log=myhost-bin</CODE>
(to make the server believe that these regular binlogs are relay
logs) and <CODE>skip-slave-start</CODE>,
then issue these statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CHANGE MASTER TO
    -&#62;     RELAY_LOG_FILE='myhost-bin.153',
    -&#62;     RELAY_LOG_POS=410,
    -&#62;     MASTER_HOST='some_dummy_string';
mysql&#62; START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;
</PRE>

<P>
Then the server will read and execute its own binlogs, thus achieving
crash recovery.
Once the recovery is finished, run <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>, shutdown the
server, delete <TT>`master.info'</TT> and <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT>,
and restart the server with its original options.
For the moment, specifying <CODE>MASTER_HOST</CODE> (even with a dummy value) is compulsory
to make the server think it is a slave, and giving the server a new,
different from before, server ID is also compulsory otherwise the
server will see events with its ID and think it is in a circular
replication setup and skip the events, which is unwanted. In the
future we plan to add options to get rid of these small constraints.

master's tables on which the user has no <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege will
be ignored by <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE>; this is because the
master will hide them to the user: <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> calls
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> to know the master databases to load, but
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> returns only databases on which the user has
some privilege.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Show_database_info">4.5.7.1  Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes</A>.
On the slave's side, the user which issues <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> should
have grants to drop and create the involved databases and tables.

<P>
Depending on your version of MySQL, you may not see all the fields just
shown. In particular, several fields are present only as of MySQL 4.1.1.

</P>
<P>
The fields displayed by <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> have the following meanings:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Slave_IO_State</CODE>
<DD>
A copy of the <CODE>State</CODE> column of
the output of <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> for the slave I/O thread; will
tell you if this thread is trying to connect to the master, waiting
for events from the master, reconnecting to the master, etc. Possible
states are listed in section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Implementation">4.10.2  Replication Implementation Overview</A>. Looking at
this column is necessary because, for example, the thread can be running
but unsuccessfully trying to connect to the master: only this column
will make you aware of the connection problem.
On the opposite, the state of the SQL thread is not copied, because
things are simpler for this thread: if it's running, there is no
problem; if it's not, you will find the error in the
<CODE>Last_error</CODE> column (described below). 

This field is present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>Master_Host</CODE>
<DD>
The current master host.

<DT><CODE>Master_User</CODE>
<DD>
The current user used to connect to the master.

<DT><CODE>Master_Port</CODE>
<DD>
The current master port.

<DT><CODE>Connect_Retry</CODE>
<DD>
The current value of <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>Master_Log_File</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the master's binlog file from which the I/O thread is
currently reading.

<DT><CODE>Read_Master_Log_Pos</CODE>
<DD>
The position which the I/O thread has read up to in this master's binlog.

<DT><CODE>Relay_Log_File</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the relay log file from which the SQL thread is currently
reading and executing.

<DT><CODE>Relay_Log_Pos</CODE>
<DD>
The position which the SQL thread has read and executed up to in this relay log.

<DT><CODE>Relay_Master_Log_File</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the master's binlog file that contains the
last event executed by the SQL thread.

<DT><CODE>Slave_IO_Running</CODE>
<DD>
Tells whether or not the I/O thread is started.

<DT><CODE>Slave_SQL_Running</CODE>
<DD>
Tells whether or not the SQL thread is started.

<DT><CODE>Replicate_do_db, Replicate_ignore_db</CODE>
<DD>
The lists of the databases that were specified with the
<CODE>--replicate-do-db</CODE> and <CODE>--replicate-ignore-db</CODE> options, if any

<DT><CODE>Replicate_do_table, Replicate_ignore_table, Replicate_wild_do_table, Replicate_wild_ignore_table</CODE>
<DD>
The lists of tables that were specified with the
<CODE>--replicate-do-table</CODE>,
<CODE>--replicate-ignore-table</CODE>,
<CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table</CODE>,
and
<CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore_table</CODE>
options, if any

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>Last_errno</CODE>
<DD>
The error number returned by the most recently executed query.
A value of 0 means ``no error''.

<DT><CODE>Last_error</CODE>
<DD>
The error message returned by the most recently executed query.
For example:


<PRE>
Last_errno: 1051
Last_error: error 'Unknown table 'z'' on query 'drop table z'
</PRE>

The message indicates that
the table <CODE>z</CODE> existed on the master and was dropped there, but it
did not exist on the slave, so <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> failed on the slave.
(This might occur if you forgot to copy the table to the
slave when setting up replication.)

The empty string means ``no error''.
If the <CODE>Last_error</CODE> value is not empty, it will also appear as a
message in the slave's error log.

<DT><CODE>Skip_counter</CODE>
<DD>
The last used value for <CODE>SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>Exec_master_log_pos</CODE>
<DD>
The position in the master's binlog (<CODE>Relay_Master_Log_File</CODE>)
of the last event executed by the SQL thread.
((<CODE>Relay_Master_Log_File</CODE>,<CODE>Exec_master_log_pos</CODE>) in the
master's binlog corresponds to
(<CODE>Relay_Log_File</CODE>,<CODE>Relay_Log_Pos</CODE>)
in the relay log).

<DT><CODE>Relay_log_space</CODE>
<DD>
The total combined size of all existing relay logs.

<DT><CODE>Until_condition, Until_Log_File, Until_Log_pos</CODE>
<DD>
The values specified in the <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause of the <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>
statement.

<CODE>Until_condition</CODE> has these values:


<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>None</CODE> if no <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause was specified
<LI>

<CODE>Master</CODE> if the slave is reading until a given position in the master's
binlogs
<LI>

<CODE>Relay</CODE> if the slave is reading until a given position in its relay logs
</UL>

<CODE>Until_Log_File</CODE> and <CODE>Until_Log_pos</CODE> indicate the log filename and
position values that define the point at which the SQL thread will stop
executing.

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>Master_SSL_Allowed, Master_SSL_CA_File, Master_SSL_CA_Path, Master_SSL_Cert, Master_SSL_Cipher, Master_SSL_Key</CODE>
<DD>
These fields show the
The SSL parameters used by the slave to connect to the master, if any.

<CODE>Master_SSL_Allowed</CODE> has these values:


<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>Yes</CODE> if an SSL connection to the master is allowed
<LI>

<CODE>No</CODE> if an SSL connection to the master is not allowed
<LI>

<CODE>Ignored</CODE> if an SSL connection is allowed by the slave server does not
have SSL support enabled
</UL>

The values of the other fields correspond to the values of the
<CODE>--master-ca</CODE>,
<CODE>--master-capath</CODE>,
<CODE>--master-cert</CODE>,
<CODE>--master-cipher</CODE>,
and
<CODE>--master-key</CODE>
options.

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

<DT><CODE>Seconds_behind_master</CODE>
<DD>
The number of seconds that have elapsed since the timestamp of the last
master's event executed by the slave SQL thread. Will be <CODE>NULL</CODE>
when no event has been executed yet, or after <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> and
<CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>. This column can be used to know how ``late'' your slave
is. It will work even though your master and slave don't have identical
clocks.

This field is present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

<H4><A NAME="START_SLAVE" HREF="manual_toc.html#START_SLAVE">4.10.8.8  <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX859"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
START SLAVE [thread_name [, thread_name] ... ]
START SLAVE [SQL_THREAD] UNTIL
    MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = log_pos
START SLAVE [SQL_THREAD] UNTIL
    RELAY_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', RELAY_LOG_POS = log_pos

thread_name = IO_THREAD | SQL_THREAD
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> with no options starts both of the slave threads.
The I/O thread reads queries from the master server and stores them in the
relay log.  The SQL thread reads the relay log and executes the
queries.
Note that if <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> succeeds in starting the slave threads it
will return without any error. But even in that case it might be that slave
threads start and then later stop (because they don't manage to
connect to the master or read his binlogs or any other
problem). <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> will not warn you about this. You must
check your slave's error log for error messages generated by
the slave threads, or check that these are running fine with <CODE>SHOW
SLAVE STATUS</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can add <CODE>IO_THREAD</CODE> or <CODE>SQL_THREAD</CODE>
options to the statement to name which of the threads to start.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.1.1, an <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause may be added to specify that
the slave should start until the SQL thread reaches a given point in
the master binlogs or in the slave relay longs. When the SQL thread reaches
that point, it stops.  If the <CODE>SQL_THREAD</CODE> option is specified in the
statement, it starts only the SQL thread.  Otherwise, it starts both slave
threads.  If the SQL thread is already running, the <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause is
ignored and a warning is issued.

</P>
<P>
With an <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause, you must specify both a log filename and
position. Do not mix master and relay log options.

</P>
<P>
Any <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> condition is reset by a subsequent <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>
statement, or a <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> statement that includes no <CODE>UNTIL</CODE>
clause, or a server restart.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause can be useful for debugging replication, or to
cause replication to proceed until just before the point where you want
to avoid having the slave replicated a statement. For example, if an unwise
<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> statement was executed on the master, you can use
<CODE>UNTIL</CODE> to tell the slave to execute up to that point but no farther.
To find what the event is, use <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> with the master logs or
relay logs, or by using a <CODE>SHOW BINLOG EVENTS</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> to have the slave process replicated queries in
sections, it is recommended that you start the slave with the
<CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> option to prevent the SQL thread from running
when the slave starts.  It's probably best to use this option in an option
file rather than on the command line, so that an unexpected server restart does
not cause it to be forgotten.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> statement includes output fields that display
the current values of the <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> condition.

</P>
<P>
This command is called <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> before MySQL 4.0.5.
For the moment, <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> is still accepted for backward
compatibility, but is deprecated.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX860"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
STOP SLAVE [thread_name [, thread_name] ... ]

thread_name = IO_THREAD | SQL_THREAD
</PRE>

<P>
Stops the slave threads.
Like <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>, this statement
may be used with the <CODE>IO_THREAD</CODE> and <CODE>SQL_THREAD</CODE> options to name
the thread or threads to stop.

</P>
<P>
This command is called <CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE> before MySQL 4.0.5.
For the moment, <CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE> is still accepted for backward
compatibility, but is deprecated.

<H3><A NAME="Replication_FAQ" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.9  Replication FAQ</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I configure a slave if the master is already running
and I do not want to stop it?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: There are several options. If you have taken a backup of the
master at some point and recorded the binlog name and offset ( from the
output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> ) corresponding to the snapshot, do
the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make sure the slave is assigned a unique server ID.
<LI>

Execute the following statement on the slave, filling in appropriate values for each
parameter:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CHANGE MASTER TO
    -&#62;     MASTER_HOST='master_host-name',
    -&#62;     MASTER_USER='master_user_name',
    -&#62;     MASTER_PASSWORD='master_pass',
    -&#62;     MASTER_LOG_FILE='recorded_log_name',
    -&#62;     MASTER_LOG_POS=recorded_log_pos;
</PRE>

<LI>

Execute <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> on the slave.
</OL>

<P>
If you do not have a backup of the master already, here is a quick way to
do it consistently:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>gtar zcf /tmp/backup.tar.gz /var/lib/mysql</CODE> (or a variation of this)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> - make sure to record the output - you will need it
later
<LI>

<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE>
</OL>

<P>
An alternative is taking an SQL dump of the master instead of a binary
copy like above; for this you can use <CODE>mysqldump --master-data</CODE>
on your master and later run this SQL dump into your slave. However, this is
slower than makeing a binary copy.

</P>
<P>
No matter which of the two methods you use, afterwards follow the
instructions for the case when you have a snapshot and 
have recorded the log name and offset. You can use the same snapshot to set up
several slaves. As long as the binary logs of the master are left intact, you
can wait as long as several days or in some cases maybe a month to set up a
slave once you have the snapshot of the master. In theory the waiting gap can
be infinite. The two practical limitations is the diskspace of the master
getting filled with old logs, and the amount of time it will take the slave to
catch up.

</P>
<P>
You can also use <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM
MASTER</CODE>.  This is a convenient command that takes a snapshot,
restores it to the slave, and adjusts the log name and offset on the slave
all at once. In the future, <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> will be the
recommended way to set up a slave.  Be warned, howerver, that the read
lock may be held for a long time if you use this command. It is not yet
implemented as efficiently as we would like to have it. If you have
large tables, the preferred method at this time is still with a local
<CODE>tar</CODE> snapshot after executing <CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Does the slave need to be connected to the master all the time?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: No, it does not. The slave can go down or stay
disconnected for hours or even days, then reconnect and catch up on the
updates.
For example, you can set up a master/slave relationship over a dial-up link
where the link is up only sporadically and
for short periods of time. The implication of this is that at any
given time the slave is not guaranteed to be in sync with the master
unless you take some special measures. In the future, we will have the
option to block the master until at least one slave is in sync.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I know how late a slave is compared to the
master? In other words, how do I know the date of the last query
replicated by the slave?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: 
If the slave is 4.1.1 or newer, read the <CODE>Seconds_behind_master</CODE>
column in <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. For older versions, the following
applies.
This is possible only if the slave SQL thread exists
(that is, if it shows up in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Implementation_Details">4.10.3  Replication Implementation Details</A>) 
(in MySQL 3.23: if the slave thread exists, that is, shows up in
<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>),
and if it has executed at least one event
from the master. Indeed, when the slave SQL thread executes an event
read from the master, this thread modifies its own time to the event's
timestamp (this is why <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is well replicated). So in the
<CODE>Time</CODE> column in the output of <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>, the
number of seconds displayed for the slave SQL thread is the number of
seconds between the timestamp of the last replicated event and the
real time of the slave machine. You can use this to determine the date
of the last replicated event. Note that if your slave has been
disconnected from the master for one hour, then reconnects,
you may immediately see <CODE>Time</CODE> values like 3600 for the slave SQL
thread in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>... This would be because the slave
is executing queries that are one hour old.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I force the master to block updates until the slave catches
up?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: Use the following procedure:

</P>

<OL>

<LI>

On the master, execute these commands:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql&#62; SHOW MASTER STATUS;
</PRE>

Record the log name and the offset from the output of the <CODE>SHOW</CODE>
statement.

<LI>

On the slave, issue this command, where the replication coordinates that are
the arguments to the <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE> function are the values recorded
in the previous step:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT MASTER_POS_WAIT('log_name', log_offset);
</PRE>

The <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement will block until the slave reaches the specified
log file and offset. At that point, the slave will be in sync with the master
and the statement will return.

<LI>

On the master, issue the following statement to allow the master to begin
processing updates again:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What issues should I be aware of when setting up two-way
replication?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: MySQL replication currently does not support any
locking protocol between master and slave to guarantee the atomicity of
a distributed (cross-server) update. In other words, it is possible
for client A to make an update to  co-master 1, and in the meantime,
before it propagates to co-master 2, client B could make an update to
co-master 2 that will make the update of client A work differently than
it did on co-master 1. Thus, when the update of client A will make it
to co-master 2, it will produce  tables that are different than
what you have on co-master 1, even after all the updates from co-master
2 have also propagated. So you should not co-chain two servers in a
two-way replication relationship, unless you are sure that your updates
can safely happen in any order, or unless you take care of mis-ordered
updates somehow in the client code.

</P>
<P>
You must also realise that two-way replication actually does not improve
performance very much (if at all), as far as updates are concerned. Both
servers need to do the same amount of updates each, as you would have
one server do. The only difference is that there will be a little less
lock contention, because the updates originating on another server will
be serialised in one slave thread. Even so, this benefit might be
offset by network delays.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX861"></A>
<A NAME="IDX862"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How can I use replication to improve performance of my system?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: You should set up one server as the master and direct all
writes to it. Then configure as many slaves as you have the money and
rackspace for, and distribute the reads among the master and the slaves.
You can also start the slaves with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE>,
<CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE> and <CODE>--delay-key-write=ALL</CODE>
to get speed improvements for the slave.  In this case the slave will
use non-transactional <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables instead of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables
to get more speed.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What should I do to prepare client code in my own applications
to use performance-enhancing replication?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:
If the part of your code that is responsible for database access has
been properly abstracted/modularised, converting it to run with a
replicated setup should be very smooth and easy. Just change the
implementation of your database access to send all writes the the master,
and to send reads to either the master or a slave.
If your code does not have this level of abstraction,
setting up a replicated system will give you the opportunity and motivation
to it clean up.
You should start by creating a wrapper library or module with the following
functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_writer_connect()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_reader_connect()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_reader_query()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_writer_query()</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>safe_</CODE> in each function name means that the function will take care
of handling all the error conditions.
You can, of course, use different names for the
functions. The important thing is to have a unified interface for connecting
for reads, connecting for writes, doing a read, and doing a write.

</P>
<P>
You should then convert your client code to use the wrapper library.
This may be a painful and scary process at first, but it will pay off in
the long run. All applications that use the approach just described will be
able to take advantage of a master/slave configuration, even one involving
multiple slaves.  The
code will be a lot easier to maintain, and adding troubleshooting
options will be trivial. You will just need to modify one or two
functions, for example, to log how long each query took, or which
query, among your many thousands, gave you an error.

</P>
<P>
If you have
written a lot of code already, you may want to automate the conversion
task by using the <CODE>replace</CODE> utility that comes with the
standard distribution of MySQL, or just write your own Perl script.
Hopefully, your code follows some recognisable pattern. If not, then
you are probably better off rewriting it anyway, or at least going
through and manually beating it into a pattern.

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: When and how much can MySQL replication improve the performance
of my system?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: MySQL replication is most beneficial for a system
with frequent reads and infrequent writes. In theory, by using a
single-master/multiple-slave setup, you can scale the system by adding more
slaves until you either run out of network bandwidth, or your update
load grows to the point that the master cannot handle it.

</P>
<P>
In order to determine how many slaves you can get before the added
benefits begin to level out, and how much you can improve performance
of your site, you need to know your query patterns, and empirically
 (by benchmarking) determine the relationship between the throughput
on reads (reads per second, or <CODE>max_reads</CODE>) and on writes
(<CODE>max_writes</CODE>) on a typical master and a typical slave. The
example here will show you a rather simplified calculation of what you
can get with replication for a hypothetical system.

</P>
<P>
Let's say that system load consists of 10% writes and 90% reads, and we
have determined <CODE>max_reads</CODE> to be 1200 - 2 * <CODE>max_writes</CODE>.
In other words, the system can do 1200 reads per second with no
writes, the average write is twice as slow as average read,
and the relationship is
linear. Let us suppose that the master and each slave have the same
capacity, and that we have 1 master and N slaves. Then we have for each
server (master or slave):

</P>
<P>
<CODE>reads = 1200 - 2 * writes</CODE> (from benchmarks)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>reads = 9* writes / (N + 1) </CODE> (reads split, but writes go
to all servers)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>9*writes/(N+1) + 2 * writes = 1200</CODE>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>writes = 1200/(2 + 9/(N+1)</CODE>

</P>
<P>
This analysis yields the following conclusions:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

If N = 0 (which means we have no replication), our system can handle
1200/11, about 109 writes per second (which means we will have 9 times
as many reads due to the nature of our application).

<LI>

If N = 1, we can get up to 184 writes per second.

<LI>

If N = 8, we get up to 400.

<LI>

If N = 17, 480 writes.

<LI>

Eventually, as N approaches infinity (and our budget negative infinity),
we can get very close to 600 writes per second, increasing system
throughput about 5.5 times. However, with only 8 servers, we increased
it almost 4 times already.

</UL>

<P>
Note that these computations assume infinite network bandwidth and
neglect several other factors that could turn out to be significant on
your system. In many cases, you may not be able to perform a computation
similar to the one above that will accurately predict what will happen
on your system if you add N replication slaves. However, answering the
following questions should help you decide whether and how much
replication will improve the performance of your system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

What is the read/write ratio on your system?
<LI>

How much more write load can one server handle if you reduce the reads?
<LI>

How many slaves do you have bandwidth available for on your network?
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How can I use replication to provide redundancy/high
availability?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: With the currently available features, you would have to
set up a master and a slave (or several slaves), and write a script
that will monitor the
master to see if it is up, and instruct your applications and
the slaves of the master change in case of failure. Some suggestions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To tell a slave to change the master, use the <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command.
<LI>

A good way to keep your applications informed as to the location of the
master is by having a dynamic DNS entry for the master.
With <CODE>bind</CODE> you can use <TT>`nsupdate'</TT> to dynamically update your DNS.
<LI>

You should run your slaves with the <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> option and without
<CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE>. This way the slave will be ready to become a
master as soon as you issue <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>; <CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>, and
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> on the other slaves.
For example, consider you have the following setup (``M'' means the
master, ``S'' the slaves, ``WC'' the clients that issue database
writes and reads; clients that issue only database reads are not
represented, because they need not switch):


<PRE>
       WC   
        \  
         v
 WC----&#62; M
       / | \  
      /  |  \     
     v   v   v
    S1   S2  S3  
</PRE>

S1 (like S2 and S3) is a slave running with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> and
without <CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE>. As the only writes executed on S1
are those replicated from M, the binary log on S1 is <STRONG>empty</STRONG>
(remember, S1 runs without <CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE>).
Then, for some reason, M becomes unavailable, and you want S1 to
become the new master (that is, direct all WC to S1, and make S2 and S3
replicate S1). 
No WC accesses M. Instruct all WC to direct their queries
to S1. From now on, all queries sent by WC to S1 are written to the binary log
of S1. The binary log of S1 contains exactly every writing query sent
to S1 since M died.
On S2 (and S3) do <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>, <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_HOST='S1'</CODE> (where <CODE>'S1'</CODE> is replaced by the real hostname of
S1). To <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE>, add all information about how to connect
to S1 from S2 or S3 (user, password, port). In <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE>, 
no need to specify
the name of S1's binary log or binary log position to read from: we
know it is the first binary log, from position 4, and these are the
defaults of <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE>. Finally do <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> on S2
and S3, and now you have this:


<PRE>
       WC   
      /   
      |  
 WC   |  M(unavailable)
  \   | 
   \  | 
    v v
     S1&#60;--S2  S3  
      ^       |
      +-------+
</PRE>

When M is up again, you just have to issue on it the same <CODE>CHANGE
MASTER</CODE> as the one issued on S2 and S3, so that M becomes a slave of
S1 and picks all the WC writes it has missed while it was down. Now to make
M a master again (because it is the most powerful machine, for example),
follow the preceding procedure as if S1 was unavailable and M was to be the
new master; then during the procedure don't forget to run <CODE>RESET
MASTER</CODE> on M before making S1, S2, S3 slaves of M, or they may pick
old WC writes from before M's unavailibility.

</UL>

<P>
We are currently working on integrating an automatic master election
system into MySQL, but until it is ready, you will have to
create your own monitoring tools.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Replication_Problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Problems">4.10.10  Troubleshooting Replication</A></H3>

<P>
If you have followed the instructions, and your replication setup is not
working, first check the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<STRONG>Check the error log for messages</STRONG>. Many users have lost time
by not doing this early enough.
<LI>

Is the master logging to the binary log? Check with <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE>.
If it is, <CODE>Position</CODE> will be non-zero. If not, verify that you have
given the master <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option and have set <CODE>server-id</CODE>.
<LI>

Is the slave running? Do <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> and check that the
<CODE>Slave_IO_Running</CODE> and <CODE>Slave_SQL_Running</CODE> values are both
<CODE>Yes</CODE>.
If not, verify slave options
<LI>

If the slave is running, did it establish a connection with the master? Do
<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>, find the I/O and SQL threads
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Implementation_Details">4.10.3  Replication Implementation Details</A> to see how they display),
and check their 
<CODE>State</CODE> column. If it says <CODE>Connecting to master</CODE>, verify the
privileges for the replication user on the master, master host name, your
DNS setup, whether the master is actually running, whether it is reachable
from the slave.
<LI>

If the slave was running before but now has stopped, the reason usually is
that some query that succeeded on the master failed on the slave. This
should never happen if you have taken a proper snapshot of the master, and
never modify the data on the slave outside of the slave thread. If it does,
it is a bug; read below on how to report it.
<LI>

If a query on that succeeded on the master refuses to run on the slave, and
it does not feasible to do
a full database resync (that is, to delete the slave's database and copy a
new snapshot from the master),
try the following:

<UL>
<LI>

First see if the slave's table was different from the
master's. Understand how it happened (it may be a bug: read the
Changelogs in the online MySQL manual as
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation">http://www.mysql.com/documentation</a>
to check if this is a known bug and if it is fixed yet). 
Then make the slave's table
identical to the master's and run <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>.
<LI>

If the above does not work or does not apply, try to understand if it would
be safe to make the update manually (if needed) and then ignore the next
query from the master.
<LI>

If you have decided you can skip the next query, issue the following
statements:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = n;
mysql&#62; START SLAVE;
</PRE>

The value of <CODE>n</CODE> should be 1 if the query does not use
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> or <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>. Otherwise, the value should
be 2.  The reason for using a value of 2 for
queries that use <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> or <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>
is that they take two events in the binary log of the master.

<LI>

Make sure you are not running into an old bug by upgrading to the most recent
version.
<LI>

If you are sure the slave started out perfectly in sync with the master,
and no one has updated  the tables involved outside of slave thread,
report the bug.
</UL>

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Bugs" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Bugs">4.10.11  Reporting Replication Bugs</A></H3>

<P>
When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and replication
still either does not work at all or is unstable, it is time to send
us a bug report. We need to get as much information as possible from you to be able
to track down the bug. Please do spend some time and effort preparing a good
bug report. 

</P>
<P>
If you have a repeatable way to demonstrate the bug, please
enter it into our bugs database
at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>. If you have a phantom problem (one that
you cannot duplicate ``at will''), use the following procedure:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Verify that no user error is involved. For example, if you update the
slave outside of the slave thread, the data will go out of sync, and you can
have unique key violations on updates. In this case, the slave thread will
stop and wait for you to clean up the tables manually to bring them in sync.
This is not a replication problem; it is a problem of outside interference
that causes replication to fail.
<LI>

Run the slave with the <CODE>--log-slave-updates</CODE> and <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>
options.
They will cause the slave to log the updates that it receives in its own
binlogs.
<LI>

Save all evidence before resetting the replication state. If we have no
information or only
sketchy information, it will take us longer to track down the problem. The
evidence you should collect is:

<UL>
<LI>

All binary logs from the master
<LI>

All binary logs from the slave
<LI>

The output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> from the master at the time
you have discovered the problem
<LI>

The output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> from the master at the time
you have discovered the problem
<LI>

Error logs from the master and on the slave
</UL>

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> to examine the binary logs. The following should
be helpful
to find the trouble query, for example:

<PRE>
mysqlbinlog -j pos_from_slave_status /path/to/log_from_slave_status | head
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Once you have collected the evidence for the phantom problem, try hard to
isolate it into a separate test case first. Then enter the problem into
our bugs database at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a> with as much
information as possible.

<H1><A NAME="MySQL_Optimisation" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_Optimisation">5  MySQL Optimisation</A></H1>

<P>
Optimisation is a complicated task because it ultimately requires
understanding of the whole system. While it may be possible to do some
local optimisations with small knowledge of your system or application,
the more optimal you want your system to become the more you will have
to know about it.

</P>
<P>
This chapter will try to explain and give some examples of different
ways to optimise MySQL.  Remember, however, that there are
always some (increasingly harder) additional ways to make the system
even faster.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Optimise_Overview" HREF="manual_toc.html#Optimise_Overview">5.1  Optimisation Overview</A></H2>

<P>
The most important part for getting a system fast is of course the basic
design. You also need to know what kinds of things your system will be
doing, and what your bottlenecks are.

</P>
<P>
The most common bottlenecks are:

<UL>
<LI>Disk seeks.

It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data. With modern disks in
1999, the mean time for this is usually lower than 10ms, so we can in
theory do about 100 seeks a second. This time improves slowly with new
disks and is very hard to optimise for a single table. The way to
optimise this is to spread the data on more than one disk.

<LI>Disk reading/writing.

When the disk is at the correct position we need to read the data. With
modern disks in 1999, one disk delivers something like 10-20 MB. This
is easier to optimise than seeks because you can read in parallel from
multiple disks.

<LI>CPU cycles.

When we have the data in main memory (or if it already were
there) we need to process it to get to our result. Having small
tables compared to the memory is the most common limiting
factor. But then, with small tables speed is usually not the problem.

<LI>Memory bandwidth.

When the CPU needs more data than can fit in the CPU cache the main
memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. This is an uncommon bottleneck
for most systems, but one should be aware of it.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Design_Limitations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Design_Limitations">5.1.1  MySQL Design Limitations/Tradeoffs</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX863"></A>
<A NAME="IDX864"></A>

</P>
<P>
When using the MyISAM storage engine, MySQL uses extremely fast table
locking (multiple readers / single writers). The biggest problem with
this table type is a if you have a mix of a steady stream of updates and
slow selects on the same table.  If this is a problem with some tables,
you can use another table type for these. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL can work with both transactional and non-transactional tables.
To be able to work smoothly with non-transactional tables (which can't
rollback if something goes wrong), MySQL has the following rules:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX865"></A>

<UL>
<LI>

All columns have default values.
<LI>

If you insert a 'wrong' value in a column like a <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> column or a too big numerical value in a numerical
column, MySQL will instead of giving an error instead set the column to
the 'best possible value'.  For numerical values this is 0, the smallest
possible values or the largest possible value. For strings this is
either the empty string or the longest possible string that can be in
the column.
<LI>

All calculated expressions returns a value that can be used instead of
signaling an error condition. For example 1/0 returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
For more information about this, see See section <A HREF="manual.html#Constraints">1.7.5  How MySQL deals with constraints</A>.

</P>
<P>
The above means that one should not use MySQL to check fields content,
but one should do this in the application.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Portability" HREF="manual_toc.html#Portability">5.1.2  Portability</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX866"></A>
<A NAME="IDX867"></A>
<A NAME="IDX868"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because all SQL servers implement different parts of SQL, it takes work to
write portable SQL applications. For very simple selects/inserts it is
very easy, but the more you need the harder it gets. If you want an
application that is fast with many databases it becomes even harder!

</P>
<P>
To make a complex application portable you need to choose a number of
SQL servers that it should work with.

</P>
<P>
You can use the MySQL <CODE>crash-me</CODE> program/web-page
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php">http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php</a> to find functions,
types, and limits you can use with a selection of database
servers. Crash-me now tests far from everything possible, but it
is still comprehensive with about 450 things tested.

</P>
<P>
For example, you shouldn't have column names longer than 18 characters
if you want to be able to use Informix or DB2.

</P>
<P>
Both the MySQL benchmarks and <CODE>crash-me</CODE> programs are very
database-independent.  By taking a look at how we have handled this, you
can get a feeling for what you have to do to write your application
database-independent.  The benchmarks themselves can be found in the
<TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory in the MySQL source
distribution. They are written in Perl with DBI database interface
(which solves the access part of the problem).

</P>
<P>
See <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a> for the results
from this benchmark.

</P>
<P>
As you can see in these results, all databases have some weak points. That
is, they have different design compromises that lead to different
behaviour.

</P>
<P>
If you strive for database independence, you need to get a good feeling
for each SQL server's bottlenecks. MySQL is very fast in
retrieving and updating things, but will have a problem in mixing slow
readers/writers on the same table. Oracle, on the other hand, has a big
problem when you try to access rows that you have recently updated
(until they are flushed to disk). Transaction databases in general are
not very good at generating summary tables from log tables, as in this
case row locking is almost useless.

</P>
<P>
To get your application <EM>really</EM> database-independent, you need to define
an easy extendable interface through which you manipulate your data. As
C++ is available on most systems, it makes sense to use a C++ classes
interface to the databases.

</P>
<P>
If you use some specific feature for some database (like the
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command in MySQL), you should code a method for
the other SQL servers to implement the same feature (but slower).  With
MySQL you can use the <CODE>/*!  */</CODE> syntax to add
MySQL-specific keywords to a query.  The code inside
<CODE>/**/</CODE> will be treated as a comment (ignored) by most other SQL
servers.

</P>
<P>
If high performance is more important than exactness, as in some
web applications, it is possibile to create an application layer that
caches all results to give you even higher performance. By letting
old results 'expire' after a while, you can keep the cache reasonably
fresh.  This provides a method to handle high load spikes, in which case
you can dynamically increase the cache and set the expire timeout higher
until things get back to normal.

</P>
<P>
In this case the table creation information should contain information
of the initial size of the cache and how often the table should normally
be refreshed.

</P>

</P>
<P>
During MySQL initial development, the features of MySQL
were made to fit our largest customer. They handle data warehousing for a
couple of the biggest retailers in Sweden.

</P>
<P>
From all stores, we get weekly summaries of all bonus card transactions,
and we are expected to provide useful information for the store owners
to help them find how their advertisement campaigns are affecting their
customers.

</P>
<P>
The data is quite huge (about 7 million summary transactions per month),
and we have data for 4-10 years that we need to present to the users.
We got weekly requests from the customers that they want to get
'instant' access to new reports from this data.

</P>
<P>
We solved this by storing all information per month in compressed
'transaction' tables. We have a set of simple macros (script) that
generates summary tables grouped by different criteria (product group,
customer id, store ...) from the transactional tables.  The reports are
web pages that are dynamically generated by a small Perl script that
parses a web page, executes the SQL statements in it, and inserts the
results. We would have used PHP or mod_perl instead but they were
not available at that time.

</P>
<P>
For graphical data we wrote a simple tool in <CODE>C</CODE> that can produce
GIFs based on the result of an SQL query (with some processing of the
result). This is also dynamically executed from the Perl script that
parses the <CODE>HTML</CODE> files.

</P>
<P>
In most cases a new report can simply be done by copying an existing
script and modifying the SQL query in it.  In some cases, we will need to
add more fields to an existing summary table or generate a new one, but
this is also quite simple, as we keep all transactions tables on disk.
(Currently we have at least 50G of transactions tables and 200G of other
customer data.)

</P>
<P>
We also let our customers access the summary tables directly with ODBC
so that the advanced users can themselves experiment with the data.

</P>
<P>
We haven't had any problems handling this with quite modest Sun Ultra
SPARCstation (2x200 Mhz). We recently upgraded one of our servers to a 2
CPU 400 Mhz UltraSPARC, and we are now planning to start handling
transactions on the product level, which would mean a ten-fold increase
of data. We think we can keep up with this by just adding more disk to
our systems.

</P>
<P>
We are also experimenting with Intel-Linux to be able to get more CPU
power cheaper. Now that we have the binary portable database format (new
in Version 3.23), we will start to use this for some parts of the application.

</P>
<P>
Our initial feelings are that Linux will perform much better on
low-to-medium load and Solaris will perform better when you start to get a
high load because of extreme disk IO, but we don't yet have anything
conclusive about this. After some discussion with a Linux Kernel
developer, this might be a side effect of Linux giving so much resources
to the batch job that the interactive performance gets very low. This
makes the machine feel very slow and unresponsive while big batches are
going. Hopefully this will be better handled in future Linux Kernels.

</P>

MySQL source distributions.

</P>
<P>
This benchmark suite is meant to be a benchmark that will tell any user
what things a given SQL implementation performs well or poorly at.

Note that this benchmark is single threaded, so it measures the minimum
time for the operations. We plan to in the future add a lot of
multi-threaded tests to the benchmark suite.

We have gathered some more benchmark results at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
Note that Oracle is not included because they asked to be removed. All
Oracle benchmarks have to be passed by Oracle! We believe that makes
Oracle benchmarks <STRONG>very</STRONG> biased because the above benchmarks are
supposed to show what a standard installation can do for a single
client.

</P>
<P>
To run the benchmark suite, you have to download a MySQL source
distribution, install the Perl DBI driver, the Perl DBD driver for the
database you want to test and then do:

</P>

<PRE>
cd sql-bench
perl run-all-tests --server=#

where # is one of supported servers. You can get a list of all options
and supported servers by doing <CODE>run-all-tests --help</CODE>.

<CODE>crash-me</CODE> tries to determine what features a database supports and
what its capabilities and limitations are by actually running
queries. For example, it determines:

</P>

What column types are supported
<LI>

How many indexes are supported
<LI>

What functions are supported
<LI>

How big a query can be

You should definitely benchmark your application and database to find
out where the bottlenecks are.  By fixing it (or by replacing the
bottleneck with a 'dummy module') you can then easily identify the next
bottleneck (and so on).  Even if the overall performance for your
application is sufficient, you should at least make a plan for each
bottleneck, and decide how to solve it if someday you really need the
extra performance.

</P>
<P>
For an example of portable benchmark programs, look at the MySQL
benchmark suite. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>. You
can take any program from this suite and modify it for your needs. By doing
this, you can try different solutions to your problem and test which is really
the fastest solution for you.

</P>
<P>
Another free benchmark suite is the <CODE>Open Source Database Benchmark</CODE>
which may be found at <a HREF="http://osdb.sourceforge.net/">http://osdb.sourceforge.net/</a>.

<P>
It is very common that some problems only occur when the system is very
heavily loaded. We have had many customers who contact us when they
have a (tested) system in production and have encountered load problems. In
every one of these cases so far, it has been problems with basic design
(table scans are <STRONG>not good</STRONG> at high load) or OS/Library issues. Most of
this would be a <STRONG>lot</STRONG> easier to fix if the systems were not
already in production.

</P>
<P>
To avoid problems like this, you should put some effort into benchmarking
your whole application under the worst possible load!  You can use
Super Smack for this, and it is available at:
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz</a>.
As the name suggests, it can bring your system down to its knees if you ask it,
so make sure to use it only on your development systems.

First, one thing that affects all queries: The more complex permission
system setup you have, the more overhead you get.

</P>
<P>
If you do not have any <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements done, MySQL will
optimise the permission checking somewhat. So if you have a very high
volume it may be worth the time to avoid grants. Otherwise, more
permission check results in a larger overhead.

</P>
<P>
If your problem is with some explicit MySQL function, you can
always time this in the MySQL client:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1);
+------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1) |
+------------------------+
|                      0 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.32 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The above shows that MySQL can execute 1,000,000 <CODE>+</CODE>
expressions in 0.32 seconds on a <CODE>PentiumII 400MHz</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL functions should be very optimised, but there may be
some exceptions, and the <CODE>BENCHMARK(loop_count,expression)</CODE> is a
great tool to find out if this is a problem with your query.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="EXPLAIN" HREF="manual_toc.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX879"></A>
<A NAME="IDX880"></A>

</P>


<PRE>
    EXPLAIN tbl_name
or  EXPLAIN SELECT select_options
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>EXPLAIN tbl_name</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> or
<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you precede a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement with the keyword <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>,
MySQL explains how it would process the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, providing
information about how tables are joined and in which order.

</P>
<P>
With the help of <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, you can see when you must add indexes
to tables to get a faster <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that uses indexes to find the
records.

</P>
<P>
You should frequently run <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> to update table statistics
such as cardinality of keys which can affect the choices the optimiser
makes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also see if the optimiser joins the tables in an optimal
order. To force the optimiser to use a specific join order for a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, add a <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
For non-simple joins, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> returns a row of information for each
table used in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement. The tables are listed in the order
they would be read.  MySQL resolves all joins using a single-sweep
multi-join method. This means that MySQL reads a row from the first
table, then finds a matching row in the second table, then in the third table
and so on. When all tables are processed, it outputs the selected columns and
backtracks through the table list until a table is found for which there are
more matching rows. The next row is read from this table and the process
continues with the next table.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL version 4.1 the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output was changed to work better
with constructs like <CODE>UNION</CODE>s, subqueries and derived tables. Most
notable is the addition of two new columns: <CODE>id</CODE> and <CODE>select_type</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> consists of the following columns:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>id</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> identifier, the sequential number of this <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
within the query.

<DT><CODE>select_type</CODE>
<DD>
Type of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> clause, which can be any of the following:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SIMPLE</CODE>
<DD>
Simple <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (without <CODE>UNION</CODE>s or subqueries).

<DT><CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>
<DD>
Outermost <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>UNION</CODE>
<DD>
Second and further <CODE>UNION</CODE> <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s.

<DT><CODE>DEPENDENT UNION</CODE>
<DD>
Second and further <CODE>UNION</CODE> <CODE>SELECTS</CODE>s, dependent on outer
subquery.

<DT><CODE>SUBQUERY</CODE>
<DD>
First <CODE>SELECT</CODE> in subquery.

<DT><CODE>DEPENDENT SUBQUERY</CODE>
<DD>
First <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, dependent on outer subquery.

<DT><CODE>DERIVED</CODE>
<DD>
Derived table <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>table</CODE>
<DD>
The table to which the row of output refers.

<DT><CODE>type</CODE>
<DD>
The join type. The different join types are listed here, ordered from
best to worst type:

<A NAME="IDX881"></A>
<A NAME="IDX882"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>system</CODE>
<DD>
The table has only one row (= system table). This is a special case of
the <CODE>const</CODE> join type.

<A NAME="IDX883"></A>
<A NAME="IDX884"></A>
<DT><CODE>const</CODE>
<DD>
The table has at most one matching row, which will be read at the start
of the query. Because there is only one row, values from the column in
this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the
optimiser. <CODE>const</CODE> tables are very fast as they are read only once!

<CODE>const</CODE> is used when you compare all parts of a
<CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>/<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key with constants:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM const_table WHERE primary_key=1;

SELECT * FROM const_table WHERE primary_key_part1=1 and primary_key_part2=2;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>eq_ref</CODE>
<DD>
One row will be read from this table for each combination of rows from
the previous tables.  This is the best possible join type, other than the
<CODE>const</CODE> types.  It is used when all parts of an index are used by
the join and the index is <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.

<CODE>eq_ref</CODE> can be used for indexed columns that is compared with
<CODE>=</CODE>.  The compared item may be a constant or an expression that uses
columns from tables that are read before this table.

In the following examples, <CODE>ref_table</CODE> will be able to use <CODE>eq_ref</CODE>


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table WHERE
ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table WHERE
ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column AND
ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>ref</CODE>
<DD>
All rows with matching index values will be read from this table for each
combination of rows from the previous tables.  <CODE>ref</CODE> is used if the join
uses only a leftmost prefix of the key, or if the key is not <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> (in other words, if the join cannot select a single
row based on the key value).  If the key that is used matches only a few rows,
this join type is good.

<CODE>ref</CODE> can be used for indexed columns that is compared with <CODE>=</CODE>.

In the following examples, <CODE>ref_table</CODE> will be able to use <CODE>ref</CODE>


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM ref_table WHERE key_column=expr;

SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table WHERE
ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table WHERE
ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column AND
ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>ref_or_null</CODE>
<DD>
Like <CODE>ref</CODE>, but with the addition that we will do an extra search for
rows with <CODE>NULL</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#IS_NULL_optimisation">5.2.5  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>IS NULL</CODE></A>.


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM ref_table WHERE key_column=expr OR key_column IS NULL; 
</PRE>

This optimisation is new for MySQL 4.1.1 and is mostly used when
resolving sub queries.

<DT><CODE>range</CODE>
<DD>
Only rows that are in a given range will be retrieved, using an index to
select the rows.  The <CODE>key</CODE> column indicates which index is used.
The <CODE>key_len</CODE> contains the longest key part that was used.
The <CODE>ref</CODE> column will be <CODE>NULL</CODE> for this type.

<CODE>range</CODE> can be used for when an key column is compared to a
constant with <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;=</CODE>, <CODE>IS NULL</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>BETWEEN</CODE> and <CODE>IN</CODE>.


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM range_table WHERE key_column = 10;

SELECT * FROM range_table WHERE key_column BETWEEN 10 and 20;

SELECT * FROM range_table WHERE key_column IN (10,20,30);

SELECT * FROM range_table WHERE key_part1= 10 and key_part2 IN (10,20,30);
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>index</CODE>
<DD>
This is the same as <CODE>ALL</CODE>, except that only the index tree is
scanned.  This is usually faster than <CODE>ALL</CODE>, as the index file is usually
smaller than the datafile.

This can be used when the query only uses columns that are part of one index.

<DT><CODE>ALL</CODE>
<DD>
A full table scan will be done for each combination of rows from the
previous tables.  This is normally not good if the table is the first
table not marked <CODE>const</CODE>, and usually <STRONG>very</STRONG> bad in all other
cases. You normally can avoid <CODE>ALL</CODE> by adding more indexes, so that
the row can be retrieved based on constant values or column values from
earlier tables.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>possible_keys</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> column indicates which indexes MySQL
could use to find the rows in this table. Note that this column is
totally independent of the order of the tables. That means that some of
the keys in <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> may not be usable in practice with the
generated table order.

If this column is empty, there are no relevant indexes. In this case,
you may be able to improve the performance of your query by examining
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to see if it refers to some column or columns
that would be suitable for indexing.  If so, create an appropriate index
and check the query with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To see what indexes a table has, use <CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>key</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>key</CODE> column indicates the key (index) that MySQL actually
decided to use. The key is <CODE>NULL</CODE> if no index was chosen. To force
MySQL to use an key listed in the <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> column, use
<CODE>USE KEY/IGNORE KEY</CODE> in your query.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Also, running <CODE>myisamchk --analyze</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#myisamchk_syntax">4.4.6.1  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Invocation Syntax</A>) or <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>) on the table will help the
optimiser choose better indexes.

<DT><CODE>key_len</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>key_len</CODE> column indicates the length of the key that
MySQL decided to use.  The length is <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the
<CODE>key</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Note that this tells us how many parts of a
multi-part key MySQL will actually use.

<DT><CODE>ref</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>ref</CODE> column shows which columns or constants are used with the
<CODE>key</CODE> to select rows from the table.

<DT><CODE>rows</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>rows</CODE> column indicates the number of rows MySQL
believes it must examine to execute the query.

<DT><CODE>Extra</CODE>
<DD>
This column contains additional information of how MySQL will
resolve the query. Here is an explanation of the different text
strings that can be found in this column:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Distinct</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL will not continue searching for more rows for the current row
combination after it has found the first matching row.

<DT><CODE>Not exists</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL was able to do a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> optimisation on the
query and will not examine more rows in this table for the previous row
combination after it finds one row that matches the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> criteria.

Here is an example for this:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

Assume that <CODE>t2.id</CODE> is defined with <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.  In this case
MySQL will scan <CODE>t1</CODE> and look up the rows in <CODE>t2</CODE>
through <CODE>t1.id</CODE>. If MySQL finds a matching row in
<CODE>t2</CODE>, it knows that <CODE>t2.id</CODE> can never be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, and will
not scan through the rest of the rows in <CODE>t2</CODE> that has the same
<CODE>id</CODE>.  In other words, for each row in <CODE>t1</CODE>, MySQL
only needs to do a single lookup in <CODE>t2</CODE>, independent of how many
matching rows there are in <CODE>t2</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>range checked for each record (index map: #)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
MySQL didn't find a real good index to use. It will, instead, for
each row combination in the preceding tables, do a check on which index to
use (if any), and use this index to retrieve the rows from the table.  This
isn't very fast but is faster than having to do a join without
an index.

<DT><CODE>Using filesort</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL will need to do an extra pass to find out how to retrieve
the rows in sorted order.  The sort is done by going through all rows
according to the <CODE>join type</CODE> and storing the sort key + pointer to
the row for all rows that match the <CODE>WHERE</CODE>. Then the keys are
sorted. Finally the rows are retrieved in sorted order.

<DT><CODE>Using index</CODE>
<DD>
The column information is retrieved from the table using only
information in the index tree without having to do an additional seek to
read the actual row.  This can be done when all the used columns for
the table are part of the same index.

<DT><CODE>Using temporary</CODE>
<DD>
To resolve the query MySQL will need to create a
temporary table to hold the result.  This typically happens if you do an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on a different column set than you did a <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> on.

<DT><CODE>Using where</CODE>
<DD>
A <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will be used to restrict which rows will be
matched against the next table or sent to the client.  If you don't have
this information and the table is of type <CODE>ALL</CODE> or <CODE>index</CODE>,
you may have something wrong in your query (if you don't intend to
fetch/examine all rows from the table).
</DL>

If you want to get your queries as fast as possible, you should look out for
<CODE>Using filesort</CODE> and <CODE>Using temporary</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
You can get a good indication of how good a join is by multiplying all values
in the <CODE>rows</CODE> column of the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output. This should tell you
roughly how many rows MySQL must examine to execute the query. This
number is also used when you restrict queries with the <CODE>max_join_size</CODE>
variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following example shows how a <CODE>JOIN</CODE> can be optimised progressively
using the information provided by <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement shown here, that you examine
using <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
            tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
            tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
            tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
            tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
            tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
            et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
        FROM tt, et, et AS et_1, do
        WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
            AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;
</PRE>

<P>
For this example, assume that:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The columns being compared have been declared as follows:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

The tables have the indexes shown here:

<TR><TD><CODE>do</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>CUSTNMBR</CODE> (primary key)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI>

The <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> values aren't evenly distributed.
</UL>

<P>
Initially, before any optimisations have been performed, the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>
statement produces the following information:

</P>

<PRE>
table type possible_keys                key  key_len ref  rows  Extra
et    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
do    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 2135
et_1  ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
tt    ALL  AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL    NULL 3872
      range checked for each record (key map: 35)
</PRE>

<P>
Because <CODE>type</CODE> is <CODE>ALL</CODE> for each table, this output indicates that
MySQL is generating a Cartesian product of all the tables!  This will take
quite a long time, as the product of the number of rows in each table must be
examined!  For the case at hand, this is <CODE>74 * 2135 * 74 * 3872 =
45,268,558,720</CODE> rows.  If the tables were bigger, you can only imagine how
long it would take.

</P>
<P>
One problem here is that MySQL can't (yet) use indexes on columns
efficiently if they are declared differently.  In this context,
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> are the same unless they are declared as
different lengths. Because <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> is declared as <CODE>CHAR(10)</CODE>
and <CODE>et.EMPLOYID</CODE> is declared as <CODE>CHAR(15)</CODE>, there is a length
mismatch.

</P>
<P>
To fix this disparity between column lengths, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
lengthen <CODE>ActualPC</CODE> from 10 characters to 15 characters:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);
</PRE>

<P>
Now <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> and <CODE>et.EMPLOYID</CODE> are both <CODE>VARCHAR(15)</CODE>.
Executing the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> statement again produces this result:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref         rows    Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL NULL 3872    Using where
do    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        2135
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et_1  ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        74
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC 1
</PRE>

<P>
This is not perfect, but is much better (the product of the <CODE>rows</CODE>
values is now less by a factor of 74). This version is executed in a couple
of seconds.

</P>
<P>
A second alteration can be made to eliminate the column length mismatches
for the <CODE>tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID</CODE> and <CODE>tt.ClientID =
do.CUSTNMBR</CODE> comparisons:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
    -&#62;                MODIFY ClientID   VARCHAR(15);
</PRE>

<P>
Now <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> produces the output shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key      key_len ref           rows Extra
et    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL     NULL    NULL          74
tt    ref    AssignedPC,     ActualPC 15      et.EMPLOYID   52   Using where
             ClientID,
             ActualPC
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY  15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY  15      tt.ClientID   1
</PRE>

<P>
This is almost as good as it can get.

</P>
<P>
The remaining problem is that, by default, MySQL assumes that values
in the <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> column are evenly distributed, and that isn't the
case for the <CODE>tt</CODE> table.  Fortunately, it is easy to tell MySQL
about this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk --analyze PATH_TO_MYSQL_DATABASE/tt
shell&#62; mysqladmin refresh
</PRE>

<P>
Now the join is perfect, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> produces this result:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys key     key_len ref           rows Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC    NULL    NULL    NULL          3872 Using where

et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID   1
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>rows</CODE> column in the output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> is an
educated guess from the MySQL join optimiser. To optimise a
query, you should check if the numbers are even close to the truth.  If not,
you may get better performance by using <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> in your
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement and trying to list the tables in a different order in
the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Estimating_performance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Estimating_performance">5.2.2  Estimating Query Performance</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX885"></A>
<A NAME="IDX886"></A>
<A NAME="IDX887"></A>

</P>
<P>
In most cases you can estimate the performance by counting disk seeks.
For small tables, you can usually find the row in 1 disk seek (as the
index is probably cached).  For bigger tables, you can estimate that
(using B++ tree indexes) you will need: <CODE>log(row_count) /
log(index_block_length / 3 * 2 / (index_length + data_pointer_length)) +
1</CODE> seeks to find a row.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL an index block is usually 1024 bytes and the data
pointer is usually 4 bytes. A 500,000 row table with an
index length of 3 (medium integer) gives you:
<CODE>log(500,000)/log(1024/3*2/(3+4)) + 1</CODE> = 4 seeks.

</P>
<P>
As the above index would require about 500,000 * 7 * 3/2 = 5.2M,
(assuming that the index buffers are filled to 2/3, which is typical)
you will probably have much of the index in memory and you will probably
only need 1-2 calls to read data from the OS to find the row.

</P>
<P>
For writes, however, you will need 4 seek requests (as above) to find
where to place the new index and normally 2 seeks to update the index
and write the row.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above doesn't mean that your application will slowly
degenerate by log N!  As long as everything is cached by the OS or SQL
server things will only go marginally slower while the table gets
bigger. After the data gets too big to be cached, things will start to
go much slower until your applications is only bound by disk-seeks
(which increase by log N). To avoid this, increase the index cache as
the data grows. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<P>
In general, when you want to make a slow <CODE>SELECT ... WHERE</CODE> faster, the
first thing to check is whether you can add an index. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>. All references between different tables
should usually be done with indexes. You can use the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command
to determine which indexes are used for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
Some general tips:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To help MySQL optimise queries better, run <CODE>myisamchk
--analyze</CODE> on a table after it has been loaded with relevant data. This
updates a value for each index part that indicates the average number of
rows that have the same value.  (For unique indexes, this is always 1,
of course.)  MySQL will use this to decide which index to
choose when you connect two tables with 'a non-constant expression'.
You can check the result from the <CODE>analyze</CODE> run by doing <CODE>SHOW
INDEX FROM table_name</CODE> and examining the <CODE>Cardinality</CODE> column.

<LI>

To sort an index and data according to an index, use <CODE>myisamchk
--sort-index --sort-records=1</CODE> (if you want to sort on index 1). If you
have a unique index from which you want to read all records in order
according to that index, this is a good way to make that faster.  Note,
however, that this sorting isn't written optimally and will take a long
time for a large table!
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Where_optimisations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Where_optimisations">5.2.4  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX890"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX891"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> optimisations are put in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part here because
they are mostly used with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, but the same optimisations apply for
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> in <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

</P>
<P>
Also note that this section is incomplete. MySQL does many
optimisations, and we have not had time to document them all.

</P>
<P>
Some of the optimisations performed by MySQL are listed here:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Removal of unnecessary parentheses:

<PRE>
   ((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
-&#62; (a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant folding:

<PRE>
   (a&#60;b AND b=c) AND a=5
-&#62; b&#62;5 AND b=c AND a=5
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant condition removal (needed because of constant folding):

<PRE>
   (B&#62;=5 AND B=5) OR (B=6 AND 5=5) OR (B=7 AND 5=6)
-&#62; B=5 OR B=6
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.
<LI>

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> on a single table without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is retrieved
directly from the table information for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables.
This is also done for any <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> expression when used with only one
table.
<LI>

Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly
detects that some <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are impossible and returns no rows.
<LI>

<CODE>HAVING</CODE> is merged with <CODE>WHERE</CODE> if you don't use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
or group functions (<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>...).
<LI>

For each sub-join, a simpler <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is constructed to get a fast
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> evaluation for each sub-join and also to skip records as
soon as possible.
<A NAME="IDX892"></A>
<A NAME="IDX893"></A>
<LI>

All constant tables are read first, before any other tables in the query.
A constant table is:

<UL>
<LI>

An empty table or a table with 1 row.
<LI>

A table that is used with a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
index, or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, where all index parts are used with constant
expressions and the index parts are defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

All the following tables are used as constant tables:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    -&#62;          WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;
</PRE>

<LI>

The best join combination to join the tables is found by trying all
possibilities. If all columns in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and in <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> come from the same table, then this table is preferred first when
joining.
<LI>

If there is an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause and a different <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
clause, or if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> contains columns
from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary
table is created.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, MySQL will use an in-memory
temporary table.
<LI>

Each table index is queried, and the best index that spans fewer than 30% of
the rows is used. If no such index can be found, a quick table scan is used.
<LI>

In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even
consulting the datafile.  If all columns used from the index are numeric,
then only the index tree is used to resolve the query.
<LI>

Before each record is output, those that do not match the <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause
are skipped.
</UL>

<P>
Some examples of queries that are very fast:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;
mysql&#62; SELECT MIN(key_part1),MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;
mysql&#62; SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        WHERE key_part_1=constant;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... LIMIT 10;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... LIMIT 10;
</PRE>

<P>
The following queries are resolved using only the index tree (assuming
the indexed columns are numeric):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT key_part1,key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;
mysql&#62; SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;
</PRE>

<P>
The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted
order without a separate sorting pass:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;            ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... ;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;            ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... ;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="IS_NULL_optimisation" HREF="manual_toc.html#IS_NULL_optimisation">5.2.5  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>IS NULL</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX894"></A>
<A NAME="IDX895"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL can do the same optimisation on <CODE>column IS NULL</CODE> as it can do
with <CODE>column = constant_value</CODE>.  For example, MySQL can use
indexes and ranges to search for <CODE>NULL</CODE> with <CODE>IS NULL</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE key_col IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE key_col &#60;=&#62; NULL;

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE key_col=# OR key_col=# OR key_col IS NULL
</PRE>

<P>
If you use <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> on a <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> in a WHERE clause
on table that is not used <CODE>OUTER JOIN</CODE> that expression will be optimised
away.

</P>
<P>
MySQL 4.1.1 can additionally optimise the combination <CODE>column =
expr AND column IS NULL</CODE>, an form that is common in resolved sub
queries.  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> will show <CODE>ref_or_null</CODE> when this
optimisation is used.

</P>
<P>
This optimisation can handle one <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> for any key part.

</P>
<P>
Some examples of queries that are optimised (assuming key on t2 (a,b)):

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a=expr OR t1.a IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE (t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL) AND t2.b=t1.b;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.a=t2.a AND (t2.b=t1.b OR t2.b IS NULL);

SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ...) OR (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ...);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>ref_or_null</CODE> works by first doing a read on the reference key
and after that a separate search after rows with NULL key.

</P>
<P>
Note that the optimisation can only handle one <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> level.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1,t2 where (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL) OR (t1.b=t2.b AND t2.b IS NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
Int the above case MySQL will only use key lookups on the part
<CODE>(t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL)</CODE> and not be able to use the key part on
<CODE>b</CODE>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="DISTINCT_optimisation" HREF="manual_toc.html#DISTINCT_optimisation">5.2.6  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX896"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX897"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> combined with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will in many cases
need a temporary table.

</P>
<P>
Note that as <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> may use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, you should be aware of
how MySQL works with in fields in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>HAVING</CODE> that
are not part of the selected fields. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GROUP-BY-hidden-fields">6.3.7.3  <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with Hidden Fields</A>.

</P>
<P>
When combining <CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> with <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, MySQL will stop
as soon as it finds <CODE>row_count</CODE> unique rows.

</P>
<P>
If you don't use columns from all used tables, MySQL will stop
the scanning of the not used tables as soon as it has found the first match.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.a;
</PRE>

<P>
In the case, assuming <CODE>t1</CODE> is used before <CODE>t2</CODE> (check with
<CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>), then MySQL will stop reading from <CODE>t2</CODE> (for that
particular row in <CODE>t1</CODE>) when the first row in <CODE>t2</CODE> is found.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="LEFT_JOIN_optimisation" HREF="manual_toc.html#LEFT_JOIN_optimisation">5.2.7  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE></A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX899"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>A LEFT JOIN B join_condition</CODE> in MySQL is implemented as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The table <CODE>B</CODE> is set to be dependent on table <CODE>A</CODE> and all tables
that <CODE>A</CODE> is dependent on.

<LI>

The table <CODE>A</CODE> is set to be dependent on all tables (except <CODE>B</CODE>)
that are used in the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition.

<LI>

The <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition is used to decide how we should retrieve rows
from table B. (In other words, any condition in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause
is not used).

<LI>

All standard join optimisations are done, with the exception that a table is
always read after all tables it is dependent on.  If there is a circular
dependence then MySQL will issue an error.

<LI>

All standard <CODE>WHERE</CODE> optimisations are done.

<LI>

If there is a row in <CODE>A</CODE> that matches the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, but there
wasn't any row in <CODE>B</CODE> that matched the <CODE>ON</CODE> condition,
then an extra <CODE>B</CODE> row is generated with all columns set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> to find rows that don't exist in some
table and you have the following test: <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> in the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> part, where column_name is a column that is declared as
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, then MySQL will stop searching after more rows
(for a particular key combination) after it has found one row that
matches the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> is implemented analogously as <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The table read order forced by <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>STRAIGHT JOIN</CODE>
will help the join optimiser (which calculates in which order tables
should be joined) to do its work much more quickly, as there are fewer
table permutations to check.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above means that if you do a query of type:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM a,b LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key)
         WHERE b.key=d.key
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL will do a full scan on <CODE>b</CODE> as the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> will force
it to be read before <CODE>d</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The fix in this case is to change the query to:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM b,a LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key)
         WHERE b.key=d.key
</PRE>

<P>
Starting from 4.0.14 MySQL does the following left join optimisation:

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition is always be false for the generated
<CODE>NULL</CODE> row, the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> is changed to a normal join.

</P>
<P>
For example, in the following query the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause would be
false if t2.column would be <CODE>NULL</CODE> so it's safe to convert to
a normal join.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT t2 ON (column) WHERE t2.column2 =5;
-&#62;
SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t2.column2=5 AND t1.column=t2.column;
</PRE>

<P>
this can be made faster as MySQL can now use table <CODE>t2</CODE> before
table <CODE>t1</CODE> if this would result in a better query plan.  To force a
specific table order one should use <CODE>STRAIGHT JOIN</CODE>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="ORDER_BY_optimisation" HREF="manual_toc.html#ORDER_BY_optimisation">5.2.8  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
In some cases MySQL can uses index to satisfy an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> request without doing any extra sorting.

</P>
<P>
The index can also be used even if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> doesn't match the
index exactly, as long as all the unused index parts and all the extra
are <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> columns are constants in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause. The following queries will use the index to resolve the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> / <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,...
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=constant ORDER BY key_part2
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=constant GROUP BY key_part2
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC
</PRE>

<P>
Some cases where MySQL can <STRONG>not</STRONG> use indexes to resolve the <CODE>ORDER
BY</CODE>: (Note that MySQL will still use indexes to find the rows that
matches the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are doing an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on different keys:

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key1,key2</CODE>
<LI>

You are doing an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> using non-consecutive key parts.

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key_part2</CODE>

<LI>

You are mixing <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE>.

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 ASC</CODE>

<LI>

The key used to fetch the rows are not the same one that is used to
do the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>:

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1</CODE>

<LI>

You are joining many tables and the columns you are doing an <CODE>ORDER
BY</CODE> on are not all from the first not-<CODE>const</CODE> table that is used to
retrieve rows (This is the first table in the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output which
doesn't use a <CODE>const</CODE> row fetch method).

<LI>

You have different <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> expressions.

<LI>

The used table index is an index type that doesn't store rows in order.
(Like the <CODE>HASH</CODE> index in <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables).
</UL>

<P>
In the cases where MySQL have to sort the result, it uses the following
algorithm:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Read all rows according to key or by table scanning.
Rows that don't match the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause are skipped.
<LI>

Store the sort-key in a buffer (of size <CODE>sort_buffer</CODE>).
<LI>

When the buffer gets full, run a qsort on it and store the result
in a temporary file.  Save a pointer to the sorted block.
(In the case where all rows fits into the sort buffer, no temporary
file is created)
<LI>

Repeat the above until all rows have been read.
<LI>

Do a multi-merge of up to <CODE>MERGEBUFF</CODE> (7) regions to one block in
another temporary file.  Repeat until all blocks from the first file
are in the second file.
<LI>

Repeat the following until there is less than <CODE>MERGEBUFF2</CODE> (15)
blocks left.
<LI>

On the last multi-merge, only the pointer to the row (last part of
the sort-key) is written to a result file.
<LI>

Now the code in <TT>`sql/records.cc'</TT> will be used to read through them
in sorted order by using the row pointers in the result file.  To
optimise this, we read in a big block of row pointers, sort these and
then we read the rows in the sorted order into a row buffer
(<CODE>read_rnd_buffer_size</CODE>) .
</UL>

<P>
You can with <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ... ORDER BY</CODE> check if MySQL can use
indexes to resolve the query.  If you get <CODE>Using filesort</CODE> in the
<CODE>extra</CODE> column, then MySQL can't use indexes to resolve the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have a higher <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> speed, you should first
see if you can get MySQL to use indexes instead of having to do an extra
sorting phase. If this is not possible, then you can do:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Increase the size of the <CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE> variable.
<LI>

Increase the size of the <CODE>read_rnd_buffer_size</CODE> variable.
<LI>

Change <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to point to a dedicated disk with lots of empty space.
If you use MySQL 4.1 or later you can spread load between
several physical disks by setting <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> These paths should end up on different <STRONG>physical</STRONG> disks,
not different partitions of the same disk.
</UL>

<P>
By default, MySQL sorts all <CODE>GROUP BY x,y[,...]</CODE> queries as if you
specified <CODE>ORDER BY x,y[,...]</CODE> in the query as well. If you include the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause explicitly,  MySQL optimises it away without any speed
penalty, though the sorting still occurs.
If a query includes <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> but you want to avoid the overhead
of sorting the result, you can supress sorting by specifying
<CODE>ORDER BY NULL</CODE>:

If you use <CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, MySQL will end the
sorting as soon as it has found the first <CODE>row_count</CODE> lines instead of sorting
the whole table.
<LI>

When combining <CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> with <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, MySQL will stop
as soon as it finds <CODE>row_count</CODE> unique rows.
<LI>

In some cases a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> can be resolved by reading the key in order
(or do a sort on the key) and then calculate summaries until the
key value changes.  In this case <CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> will not calculate any
unnecessary <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>s.
<LI>

As soon as MySQL has sent the first <CODE>#</CODE> rows to the client, it
will abort the query (if you are not using <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE>).
<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT 0</CODE> will always quickly return an empty set.  This is useful
to check the query and to get the column types of the result columns.
<LI>

When the server uses temporary tables to resolve the query, the
<CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> is used to calculate how much space is required.

<P>
Some ways to speed up inserts:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same time, use
multiple value lists <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements. This is much faster (many times
in some cases) than using separate <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  If you are adding
data to non-empty table, you may tune up the <CODE>bulk_insert_buffer_size</CODE>
variable to make it even faster.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

If you are inserting a lot of rows from different clients, you can get
higher speed by using the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Note that with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables you can insert rows at the same time
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are running if there are no deleted rows in the tables.
<LI>

When loading a table from a text file, use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. This
is usually 20 times faster than using a lot of <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

It is possible with some extra work to make <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> run even
faster when the table has many indexes. Use the following procedure:


<OL>
<LI>

Optionally create the table with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. For example, using
<CODE>mysql</CODE> or Perl-DBI.

<LI>

Execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement or the shell command <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This will
remove all usage of all indexes from the table.

<LI>

Insert data into the table with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. This will not
update any indexes and will therefore be very fast.

<LI>

If you are going to only read the table in the future, run <CODE>myisampack</CODE>
on it to make it smaller. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compressed_format">7.1.2.3  Compressed Table Characteristics</A>.

<LI>

Re-create the indexes with <CODE>myisamchk -r -q
/path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This will create the index tree in memory before
writing it to disk, which is much faster because it avoids lots of disk
seeks. The resulting index tree is also perfectly balanced.

<LI>

Execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement or the shell command <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE>.
</OL>

Note that <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> also does the above optimisation if
you insert into an empty table; the main difference with the above
procedure is that you can let <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> allocate much more temporary
memory for the index creation that you may want MySQL to allocate for
every index recreation.

Since MySQL 4.0 you can also use
<CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS</CODE> instead of
<CODE>myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE> and
<CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS</CODE> instead of
<CODE>myisamchk -r -q /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This way you can also skip
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> steps.
<LI>

You can speed up insertions that is done over multiple statements by
locking your tables:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23),(2,34),(4,33);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO a VALUES (8,26),(6,29);
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

The main speed difference is that the index buffer is flushed to disk only
once, after all <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements have completed. Normally there would
be as many index buffer flushes as there are different <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements. Locking is not needed if you can insert all rows with a single
statement.

For transactional tables, you should use <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT</CODE> instead of
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> to get a speedup.

Locking will also lower the total time of multi-connection tests, but the
maximum wait time for some threads will go up (because they wait for
locks).  For example:


<PRE>
thread 1 does 1000 inserts
thread 2, 3, and 4 does 1 insert
thread 5 does 1000 inserts
</PRE>

If you don't use locking, 2, 3, and 4 will finish before 1 and 5. If you
use locking, 2, 3, and 4 probably will not finish before 1 or 5, but the
total time should be about 40% faster.

As <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> operations are very
fast in MySQL, you will obtain better overall performance by
adding locks around everything that does more than about 5 inserts or
updates in a row.  If you do very many inserts in a row, you could do a
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> followed by an <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> once in a while
(about each 1000 rows) to allow other threads access to the table. This
would still result in a nice performance gain.

Of course, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is much faster for loading data.
</UL>

<P>
To get some more speed for both <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, enlarge the key buffer. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Update_speed" HREF="manual_toc.html#Update_speed">5.2.11  Speed of <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> Queries</A></H3>

<P>
Update queries are optimised as a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query with the additional
overhead of a write. The speed of the write is dependent on the size of
the data that is being updated and the number of indexes that are
updated.  Indexes that are not changed will not be updated.

</P>
<P>
Also, another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do
many updates in a row later. Doing many updates in a row is much quicker
than doing one at a time if you lock the table.

</P>
<P>
Note that, with dynamic record format, updating a record to
a longer total length may split the record.  So if you do this often,
it is very important to <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> sometimes.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Delete_speed" HREF="manual_toc.html#Delete_speed">5.2.12  Speed of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Queries</A></H3>

If you want to delete all rows in the table, you should use
<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE table_name</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TRUNCATE">6.4.6  <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The time to delete a record is exactly proportional to the number of
indexes. To delete records more quickly, you can increase the size of
the index cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

Unsorted tips for faster systems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use persistent connections to the database to avoid the connection
overhead. If you can't use persistent connections and you are doing a
lot of new connections to the database, you may want to change the value
of the <CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> variable. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.
<LI>

Always check that all your queries really use the indexes you have created
in the tables. In MySQL you can do this with the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>
command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.
<LI>

Try to avoid complex <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables that are
updated a lot. This is to avoid problems with table locking.
<LI>

The new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables can insert rows in a table without deleted
rows at the same time another table is reading from it.  If this is important
for you, you should consider methods where you don't have to delete rows
or run <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> after you have deleted a lot of rows.
<LI>

Use <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY expr1,expr2...</CODE> if you mostly
retrieve rows in <CODE>expr1,expr2...</CODE> order.  By using this option after big
changes to the table, you may be able to get higher performance.
<LI>

In some cases it may make sense to introduce a column that is 'hashed'
based on information from other columns. If this column is short and
reasonably unique it may be much faster than a big index on many
columns. In MySQL it's very easy to use this extra column:
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE hash=MD5(CONCAT(col1,col2))
AND col_1='constant' AND col_2='constant'</CODE>
<LI>

For tables that change a lot you should try to avoid all <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns. You will get dynamic row length as soon as you
are using a single <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

It's not normally useful to split a table into different tables just
because the rows gets 'big'. To access a row, the biggest performance
hit is the disk seek to find the first byte of the row. After finding
the data most new disks can read the whole row fast enough for most
applications. The only cases where it really matters to split up a table is if
it's a dynamic row size table (see above) that you can change to a fixed
row size, or if you very often need to scan the table and don't need
most of the columns. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

If you very often need to calculate things based on information from a
lot of rows (like counts of things), it's probably much better to
introduce a new table and update the counter in real time. An update of
type <CODE>UPDATE table SET count=count+1 WHERE index_column=constant</CODE>
is very fast!

This is really important when you use MySQL table types like MyISAM and
ISAM that
only have table locking (multiple readers / single writers). This will
also give better performance with most databases, as the row locking
manager in this case will have less to do.
<LI>

If you need to collect statistics from big log tables, use summary tables
instead of scanning the whole table. Maintaining the summaries should be
much faster than trying to do statistics 'live'. It's much faster to
regenerate new summary tables from the logs when things change
(depending on business decisions) than to have to change the running
application!
<LI>

If possible, one should classify reports as 'live' or 'statistical',
where data needed for statistical reports are only generated based on
summary tables that are generated from the actual data.
<LI>

Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values. Insert
values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from the
default. This reduces the parsing that MySQL need to do and
improves the insert speed.
<LI>

In some cases it's convenient to pack and store data into a blob. In this
case you have to add some extra code in your application to pack/unpack
things in the blob, but this may save a lot of accesses at some stage.
This is practical when you have data that doesn't conform to a static
table structure.
<LI>

Normally you should try to keep all data non-redundant (what
is called 3rd normal form in database theory), but you should not be
afraid of duplicating things or creating summary tables if you need these
to gain more speed.
<LI>

Stored procedures or UDF (user-defined functions) may be a good way to
get more performance.  In this case you should, however, always have a way
to do this some other (slower) way if you use some database that doesn't
support this.
<LI>

You can always gain something by caching queries/answers in your
application and trying to do many inserts/updates at the same time.  If
your database supports lock tables (like MySQL and Oracle),
this should help to ensure that the index cache is only flushed once
after all updates.
<LI>

Use <CODE>INSERT /*! DELAYED */</CODE> when you do not need to know when your
data is written. This speeds things up because many records can be written
with a single disk write.
<LI>

Use <CODE>INSERT /*! LOW_PRIORITY */</CODE> when you want your selects to be
more important.
<LI>

Use <CODE>SELECT /*! HIGH_PRIORITY */</CODE> to get selects that jump the
queue. That is, the select is done even if there is somebody waiting to
do a write.
<LI>

Use the multi-line <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement to store many rows with one
SQL command (many SQL servers supports this).
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to load bigger amounts of data. This is
faster than normal inserts and will be even faster when <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
is integrated in <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Use <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns to make unique values.
<LI>

Use <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> once in a while to avoid fragmentation when
using a dynamic table format. See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables to get more speed when possible. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

When using a normal web server setup, images should be stored as
files. That is, store only a file reference in the database.  The main
reason for this is that a normal web server is much better at caching
files than database contents. So it it's much easier to get a fast
system if you are using files.
<LI>

Use in memory tables for non-critical data that are accessed often (like
information about the last shown banner for users that don't have
cookies).
<LI>

Columns with identical information in different tables should be
declared identical and have identical names. Before Version 3.23 you
got slow joins otherwise.

Try to keep the names simple (use <CODE>name</CODE> instead of
<CODE>customer_name</CODE> in the customer table). To make your names portable
to other SQL servers you should keep them shorter than 18 characters.
<LI>

If you need really high speed, you should take a look at the low-level
interfaces for data storage that the different SQL servers support!  For
example, by accessing the MySQL <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> directly, you could
get a speed increase of 2-5 times compared to using the SQL interface.
To be able to do this the data must be on the same server as
the application, and usually it should only be accessed by one process
(because external file locking is really slow).  One could eliminate the
above problems by introducing low-level <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> commands in the
MySQL server (this could be one easy way to get more
performance if needed).  By carefully designing the database interface,
it should be quite easy to support this types of optimisation.
<LI>

In many cases it's faster to access data from a database (using a live
connection) than accessing a text file, just because the database is
likely to be more compact than the text file (if you are using numerical
data), and this will involve fewer disk accesses.  You will also save
code because you don't have to parse your text files to find line and
column boundaries.
<LI>

You can also use replication to speed things up. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Declaring a table with <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1</CODE> will make the updating of
indexes faster, as these are not logged to disk until the file is closed.
The downside is that you should run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on these tables before
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to ensure that they are okay if something killed
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> in the middle.  As the key information can always be generated
from the data, you should not lose anything by using <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE>.

You can find a discussion about different locking methods in the appendix.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Locking_methods">E.4  Locking methods</A>.

</P>
<P>
All locking in MySQL is deadlock-free, except for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> type tables.
This is managed by always
requesting all needed locks at once at the beginning of a query and always
locking the tables in the same order.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> type tables automatically acquire their row locks and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> type tables
their page locks during the processing of SQL statements, not at the start
of the transaction.

</P>
<P>
The locking method MySQL uses for <CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If there are no locks on the table, put a write lock on it.
<LI>

Otherwise, put the lock request in the write lock queue.
</UL>

<P>
The locking method MySQL uses for <CODE>READ</CODE> locks works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If there are no write locks on the table, put a read lock on it.
<LI>

Otherwise, put the lock request in the read lock queue.
</UL>

<P>
When a lock is released, the lock is made available to the threads
in the write lock queue, then to the threads in the read lock queue.

</P>
<P>
This means that if you have many updates on a table, <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements will wait until there are no more updates.

</P>
<P>
To work around this for the case where you want to do many <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations on a table, you can insert rows in a temporary
table and update the real table with the records from the temporary table
once in a while.

</P>
<P>
This can be done with the following code:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES real_table WRITE, insert_table WRITE;
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO real_table SELECT * FROM insert_table;
mysql&#62; TRUNCATE TABLE insert_table;
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> options with <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> with
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> if you want to prioritise retrieval in some specific
cases.  You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>
to get the same behaveour.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> can also help making table locks shorter.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You could also change the locking code in <TT>`mysys/thr_lock.c'</TT> to use a
single queue.  In this case, write locks and read locks would have the same
priority, which might help some applications.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Table_locking" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX910"></A>

</P>
<P>
The table locking code in MySQL is deadlock free.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses table locking (instead of row locking or column
locking) on all table types, except <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables,
to achieve a very
high lock speed.  For large tables, table locking is much better than
row locking for most applications, but there are, of course, some
pitfalls.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, MySQL only uses table
locking if you explicitly lock the table with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.
For these table types we recommend you to not use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> at all, because <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> uses automatic
row level locking and <CODE>BDB</CODE> uses page level locking to
ensure transaction isolation.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.7 and above, you can insert rows into
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables at the same time other threads are reading from the
table.  Note that currently this only works if there are no holes after
deleted rows in the table at the time the insert is made. When all holes
has been filled with new data, concurrent inserts will automatically be
enabled again.

</P>
<P>
Table locking enables many threads to read from a table at the same
time, but if a thread wants to write to a table, it must first get
exclusive access.  During the update, all other threads that want to
access this particular table will wait until the update is ready.

</P>
<P>
As updates on tables normally are considered to be more important than
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, all statements that update a table have higher priority
than statements that retrieve information from a table. This should
ensure that updates are not 'starved' because one issues a lot of heavy
queries against a specific table. (You can change this by using
<CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> with the statement that does the update or
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> with the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.)

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL Version 3.23.7 one can use the
<CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE> variable to force MySQL to
temporary give all <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, that wait for a table, a
higher priority after a specific number of inserts on a table.

</P>
<P>
Table locking is, however, not very good under the following senario:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A client issues a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that takes a long time to run.
<LI>

Another client then issues an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> on a used table. This client
will wait until the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is finished.
<LI>

Another client issues another <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement on the same table. As
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> has higher priority than <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, this <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
will wait for the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> to finish.  It will also wait for the first
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> to finish!
<LI>

A thread is waiting for something like <CODE>full disk</CODE>, in which case all
threads that wants to access the problem table will also be put in a waiting
state until more disk space is made available.
</UL>

<P>
Some possible solutions to this problem are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Try to get the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements to run faster. You may have to create
some summary tables to do this.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>.  This will give
all statements that update (modify) a table lower priority than a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement. In this case the last <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement in the previous
scenario would execute before the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement.

<LI>

You can give a specific <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
statement lower priority with the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a low value for <CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE> to give
<CODE>READ</CODE> locks after a certain number of <CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks.

<LI>

You can specify that all updates from a specific thread should be done with
low priority by using the SQL command: <CODE>SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can specify that a specific <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is very important with the
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If you have problems with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> combined with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
switch to use the new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as these support concurrent
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s.

<LI>

If you mainly mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> attribute to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> will probably solve your problems.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If you have problems with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>

MySQL keeps row data and index data in separate files. Many (almost
all) other databases mix row and index data in the same file. We believe that
the MySQL choice is better for a very wide range of modern systems.

</P>
<P>
Another way to store the row data is to keep the information for each
column in a separate area (examples are SDBM and Focus). This will cause a
performance hit for every query that accesses more than one column. Because
this degenerates so quickly when more than one column is accessed,
we believe that this model is not good for general purpose databases.

</P>
<P>
The more common case is that the index and data are stored together
(as in Oracle/Sybase et al). In this case you will find the row
information at the leaf page of the index. The good thing with this
layout is that it, in many cases, depending on how well the index is
cached, saves a disk read.  The bad things with this layout are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Table scanning is much slower because you have to read through the indexes
to get at the data.
<LI>

You can't use only the index table to retrieve data for a query.
<LI>

You lose a lot of space, as you must duplicate indexes from the nodes
(as you can't store the row in the nodes).
<LI>

Deletes will degenerate the table over time (as indexes in nodes are
usually not updated on delete).
<LI>

It's harder to cache only the index data.
</UL>

One of the most basic optimisation is to get your data (and indexes) to
take as little space on the disk (and in memory) as possible. This can
give huge improvements because disk reads are faster and normally less
main memory will be used. Indexing also takes less resources if
done on smaller columns.

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports a lot of different table types and row formats.
Choosing the right table format may give you a big performance gain.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get better performance on a table and minimise storage space
using the techniques listed here:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use the most efficient (smallest) types possible. MySQL has
many specialised types that save disk space and memory.

<LI>

Use the smaller integer types if possible to get smaller tables. For
example, <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE> is often better than <CODE>INT</CODE>.

<LI>

Declare columns to be <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> if possible. It makes everything
faster and you save one bit per column. Note that if you really need
<CODE>NULL</CODE> in your application you should definitely use it. Just avoid
having it on all columns by default.

<LI>

If you don't have any variable-length columns (<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>TEXT</CODE>, or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns), a fixed-size record format is
used. This is faster but unfortunately may waste some space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Formats</A>.

<LI>

The primary index of a table should be as short as possible. This makes
identification of one row easy and efficient.

<LI>

For each table, you have to decide which storage/index method to
use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

Only create the indexes that you really need. Indexes are good for
retrieval but bad when you need to store things fast. If you mostly
access a table by searching on a combination of columns, make an index
on them. The first index part should be the most used column. If you are
<STRONG>always</STRONG> using many columns, you should use the column with more duplicates
first to get better compression of the index.

<LI>

If it's very likely that a column has a unique prefix on the first number
of characters, it's better to only index this prefix. MySQL
supports an index on a part of a character column. Shorter indexes are
faster not only because they take less disk space but also because they
will give you more hits in the index cache and thus fewer disk
seeks. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<LI>

In some circumstances it can be beneficial to split into two a table that is
scanned very often. This is especially true if it is a dynamic
format table and it is possible to use a smaller static format table that
can be used to find the relevant rows when scanning the table.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="MySQL_indexes" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX919"></A>

</P>
<P>
Indexes are used to find rows with a specific value of one column
fast. Without an index MySQL has to start with the first record
and then read through the whole table until it finds the relevant
rows. The bigger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index
for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly get a position to
seek to in the middle of the datafile without having to look at all the
data. If a table has 1000 rows, this is at least 100 times faster than
reading sequentially. Note that if you need to access almost all 1000
rows it is faster to read sequentially because we then avoid disk seeks.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL indexes (<CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>, <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>, and
<CODE>INDEX</CODE>) are stored in B-trees. Strings are automatically prefix-
and end-space compressed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_INDEX">6.5.7  <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Indexes are used to:

<UL>
<LI>

Quickly find the rows that match a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins.

<LI>

Find the <CODE>MAX()</CODE> or <CODE>MIN()</CODE> value for a specific indexed
column. This is optimised by a preprocessor that checks if you are
using <CODE>WHERE</CODE> key_part_# = constant on all key parts &#60; N.  In this case
MySQL will do a single key lookup and replace the <CODE>MIN()</CODE>
expression with a constant.  If all expressions are replaced with
constants, the query will return at once:


<PRE>
SELECT MIN(key_part2),MAX(key_part2) FROM table_name where key_part1=10
</PRE>

<LI>

Sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done on a leftmost
prefix of a usable key (for example, <CODE>ORDER BY
key_part_1,key_part_2 </CODE>). The key is read in reverse order if all key
parts are followed by <CODE>DESC</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ORDER_BY_optimisation">5.2.8  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE></A>.

<LI>

In some cases a query can be optimised to retrieve values without
consulting the datafile. If all used columns for some table are numeric
and form a leftmost prefix for some key, the values may be retrieved
from the index tree for greater speed:


<PRE>
SELECT key_part3 FROM table_name WHERE key_part1=1
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Suppose you issue the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
</PRE>

<P>
If a multiple-column index exists on <CODE>col1</CODE> and <CODE>col2</CODE>, the
appropriate rows can be fetched directly. If separate single-column
indexes exist on <CODE>col1</CODE> and <CODE>col2</CODE>, the optimiser tries to
find the most restrictive index by deciding which index will find fewer
rows and using that index to fetch the rows.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX920"></A>
<A NAME="IDX921"></A>
If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the
index can be used by the optimiser to find rows. For example, if you
have a three-column index on <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>, you have indexed
search capabilities on <CODE>(col1)</CODE>, <CODE>(col1,col2)</CODE>, and
<CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL can't use a partial index if the columns don't form a
leftmost prefix of the index.  Suppose you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2 AND col3=val3;
</PRE>

<P>
If an index exists on <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>, only the first of the preceding
queries uses the index. The second and third queries do involve
indexed columns, but <CODE>(col2)</CODE> and <CODE>(col2,col3)</CODE> are not
leftmost prefixes of <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX922"></A>
<A NAME="IDX923"></A>
<A NAME="IDX924"></A>
<A NAME="IDX925"></A>
MySQL also uses indexes for <CODE>LIKE</CODE> comparisons if the argument
to <CODE>LIKE</CODE> is a constant string that doesn't start with a wildcard
character.  For example, the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements use indexes:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE "Patrick%";
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE "Pat%_ck%";
</PRE>

<P>
In the first statement, only rows with <CODE>"Patrick" &#60;= key_col &#60;
"Patricl"</CODE> are considered.  In the second statement, only rows with
<CODE>"Pat" &#60;= key_col &#60; "Pau"</CODE> are considered.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements will not use indexes:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE "%Patrick%";
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE other_col;
</PRE>

<P>
In the first statement, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> value begins with a wildcard
character.  In the second statement, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> value is not a
constant.

</P>
<P>
MySQL 4.0 does another optimisation on <CODE>LIKE</CODE>.  If you use
<CODE>... LIKE "%string%"</CODE> and <CODE>string</CODE> is longer than 3 characters,
MySQL will use the <CODE>Turbo Boyer-Moore</CODE> algorithm to initialise the
pattern for the string and then use this pattern to perform the search
quicker.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX926"></A>
<A NAME="IDX927"></A>
Searching using <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> will use indexes if column_name
is an index.

</P>
<P>
MySQL normally uses the index that finds the least number of rows. An
index is used for columns that you compare with the following operators:
<CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=</CODE>, <CODE>BETWEEN</CODE>, and a
<CODE>LIKE</CODE> with a non-wildcard prefix like <CODE>'something%'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Any index that doesn't span all <CODE>AND</CODE> levels in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause
is not used to optimise the query. In other words:  To be able to use an
index, a prefix of the index must be used in every <CODE>AND</CODE> group.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses use indexes:

<PRE>
... WHERE index_part1=1 AND index_part2=2 AND other_column=3
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10 AND index=2      /* index = 1 OR index = 2 */
... WHERE index_part1='hello' AND index_part_3=5
          /* optimised like "index_part1='hello'" */
... WHERE index1=1 and index2=2 or index1=3 and index3=3;
          /* Can use index on index1 but not on index2 or index 3 */
</PRE>

<P>
These <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> use indexes:

<PRE>
... WHERE index_part2=1 AND index_part3=2  /* index_part_1 is not used */
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10                  /* Index is not used in
                                                        both AND parts */
... WHERE index_part1=1 OR index_part2=10  /* No index spans all rows  */
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in some cases MySQL will not use an index, even if one
would be available.  Some of the cases where this happens are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If the use of the index would require MySQL to access more
than 30% of the rows in the table.  (In this case a table scan is
probably much faster, as this will require us to do much fewer seeks.)
Note that if such a query uses <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> to only retrieve
part of the rows, MySQL will use an index anyway, as it can
much more quickly find the few rows to return in the result.

All MySQL column types can be indexed.  Use of indexes on the
relevant columns is the best way to improve the performance of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
operations.

</P>
<P>
The maximum number of keys and the maximum index length is defined per
storage engine. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>. You can with all storage engines have
at least 16 keys and a total index length of at least 256 bytes.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, you can index a prefix of a
column.  This is much faster and requires less disk space than indexing the
whole column.  The syntax to use in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement to
index a column prefix looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
KEY index_name (col_name(length))
</PRE>

<P>
The example here creates an index for the first 10 characters of the
<CODE>name</CODE> column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (
    -&#62;        name CHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    -&#62;        KEY index_name (name(10)));
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, you must index a prefix of the
column.  You cannot index the entire column.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They can be
created only from <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column and partial indexing is not
supported. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A> for details.

MySQL can create indexes on multiple columns.  An index may
consist of up to 15 columns. (On <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns you
can also use a prefix of the column as a part of an index.)

</P>
<P>
A multiple-column index can be considered a sorted array containing values
that are created by concatenating the values of the indexed columns.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses multiple-column indexes in such a way that queries are
fast when you specify a known quantity for the first column of the index in a
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, even if you don't specify values for the other columns.

</P>
<P>
Suppose a table is created using the following specification:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (
    -&#62;       id INT NOT NULL,
    -&#62;       last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    -&#62;       first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    -&#62;       PRIMARY KEY (id),
    -&#62;       INDEX name (last_name,first_name));
</PRE>

<P>
Then the index <CODE>name</CODE> is an index over <CODE>last_name</CODE> and
<CODE>first_name</CODE>.  The index will be used for queries that specify
values in a known range for <CODE>last_name</CODE>, or for both <CODE>last_name</CODE>
and <CODE>first_name</CODE>.
Therefore, the <CODE>name</CODE> index will be used in the following queries:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    AND first_name="Michael";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    AND (first_name="Michael" OR first_name="Monty");

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    AND first_name &#62;="M" AND first_name &#60; "N";
</PRE>

<P>
However, the <CODE>name</CODE> index will NOT be used in the following queries:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE first_name="Michael";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    OR first_name="Michael";

This can be somewhat perplexing if you only have 6 tables.

MySQL is multi-threaded, so it may have many queries on the same table
simultaneously. To minimise the problem with two threads having
different states on the same file, the table is opened independently by
each concurrent thread. This takes some memory but will normaly increase
performance.  With <CODE>ISAM</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables this also requires
one extra file descriptor for the datafile. With these table types the index
file descriptor is shared between all threads.

<CODE>table_cache</CODE>, <CODE>max_connections</CODE>, and <CODE>max_tmp_tables</CODE>
affect the maximum number of files the server keeps open.  If you
increase one or both of these values, you may run up against a limit
imposed by your operating system on the per-process number of open file
descriptors.  However, you can increase the limit on many systems.
Consult your OS documentation to find out how to do this, because the
method for changing the limit varies widely from system to system.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>table_cache</CODE> is related to <CODE>max_connections</CODE>.  For example,
for 200 concurrent running connections, you should have a table cache of
at least <CODE>200 * n</CODE>, where <CODE>n</CODE> is the maximum number of tables
in a join.  You also need to reserve some extra file descriptors for
temporary tables and files.

</P>
<P>
Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of open file
descriptors implied by the <CODE>table_cache</CODE> setting.  If
<CODE>table_cache</CODE> is set too high, MySQL may run out of file
descriptors and refuse connections, fail to perform queries, and be very
unreliable.  You also have to take into account that the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> storage
engine needs two file descriptors for each unique open table. You can
in increase the number of file descriptors available for MySQL with
the <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> startup option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Not_enough_file_handles">A.2.17  File Not Found</A>.

</P>
<P>
The cache of open tables will be kept at a level of <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
entries. The default value is 64; this can be changed with the <CODE>-O
table_cache=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>).  Note that MySQL may
temporarily open even more tables to be able to execute queries.

</P>
<P>
A not used table is closed and removed from the table cache under the
following circumstances:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When the cache is full and a thread tries to open a table that is not in
the cache.
<LI>

When the cache contains more than <CODE>table_cache</CODE> entries and
a thread is no longer using a table.
<LI>

When someone executes <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE> or
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE>.
<LI>

When someone executes a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement.
</UL>

<P>
When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following procedure
to locate a cache entry to use:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Tables that are not currently in use are released, in least-recently-used
order.

<LI>

If the cache is full and no tables can be released, but a new table needs to
be opened, the cache is temporarily extended as necessary.

<LI>

If the cache is in a temporarily extended state and a table goes from in-use
to not-in-use state, the table is closed and released from the cache.
</UL>

<P>
A table is opened for each concurrent access. This means that
if you have two threads accessing the same table or access the table
twice in the same query (with <CODE>AS</CODE>) the table needs to be opened twice.
The first open of any table takes two file descriptors; each additional
use of the table takes only one file descriptor.  The extra descriptor
for the first open is used for the index file; this descriptor is shared
among all threads.

</P>
<P>
If you are opening a table with the <CODE>HANDLER table_name OPEN</CODE>
statement, a dedicated table object is allocated for the thread.
This table object is not shared by other threads an will not be closed
until the thread calls <CODE>HANDLER table_name CLOSE</CODE> or the thread dies.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#HANDLER">6.4.2  <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> Syntax</A>.  When this happens, the table is put
back in the table cache (if it isn't full).

</P>
<P>
You can check if your table cache is too small by checking the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
variable <CODE>Opened_tables</CODE>.  If this is quite big, even if you
haven't done a lot of <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>, you should increase your table
cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.7.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.

If you have many files in a directory, open, close, and create operations will

We start with the system level things since some of these decisions have

suffice because it not that important for the big gains. However, it is always

at this level.

The default OS to use is really important!  To get the most use of
multiple-CPU machines one should use Solaris (because the threads works
really nice) or Linux (because the 2.2 kernel has really good SMP
support). Also on 32-bit machines Linux has a 2G file-size limit by
default. Hopefully this will be fixed soon when new filesystems are
released (XFS/Reiserfs).  If you have a desperate need for files bigger
than 2G on Linux-intel 32 bit, you should get the LFS patch for the ext2
filesystem.

Other tips:

<UL>
<LI>

If you have enough RAM, you could remove all swap devices. Some
operating systems will use a swap device in some contexts even if you
have free memory.
<LI>

Use the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> MySQL option to avoid external
locking. Note that this will not impact MySQL's functionality as
long as you only run one server. Just remember to take down the server (or
lock relevant parts) before you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. On some system
this switch is mandatory because the external locking does not work in any
case.

The <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option is on by default when compiling with
MIT-pthreads, because <CODE>flock()</CODE> isn't fully supported by
MIT-pthreads on all platforms.  It's also on default for Linux
as Linux file locking are not yet safe.

The only case when you can't use <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> is if you run
multiple MySQL <EM>servers</EM> (not clients) on the same data,
or run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on the table without first flushing and locking
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server tables first.

You can still use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>/<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> even if you
are using <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>

</PRE>

<P>
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is deprecated since MySQL 4.0,
just use <CODE>--var=option</CODE> on its own.

</P>
<P>
If there is a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server currently running, you can see what
values it actually is using for the variables by executing this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

<P>
You can find a full description for all variables in the <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>
section in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also see some statistics from a running server by issuing the command
<CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.7.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses algorithms that are very scalable, so you can usually
run with very little memory. If you, however, give MySQL more
memory, you will normally also get better performance.

</P>
<P>
When tuning a MySQL server, the two most important variables to use
are <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> and <CODE>table_cache</CODE>.  You should first feel
confident that you have these right before trying to change any of the
other variables.

</P>
<P>
If you have much memory (&#62;=256M) and many tables and want maximum performance
with a moderate number of clients, you should use something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_safe -O key_buffer=64M -O table_cache=256 \
           -O sort_buffer=4M -O read_buffer_size=1M &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you have only 128M and only a few tables, but you still do a lot of
sorting, you can use something like:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_safe -O key_buffer=16M -O sort_buffer=1M
</PRE>

<P>
If you have little memory and lots of connections, use something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_safe -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=100k \
           -O read_buffer_size=100k &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
or even:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_safe -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=16k \
           -O table_cache=32 -O read_buffer_size=8k -O net_buffer_length=1K &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you are doing a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on files that are
much bigger than your available memory you should increase the value of
<CODE>read_rnd_buffer_size</CODE> to speed up the reading of rows after the sorting
is done.

</P>
<P>
When you have installed MySQL, the <TT>`support-files'</TT> directory will
contain some different <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> example files, <TT>`my-huge.cnf'</TT>,
<TT>`my-large.cnf'</TT>, <TT>`my-medium.cnf'</TT>, and <TT>`my-small.cnf'</TT>, you can
use as a base to optimise your system.

</P>
<P>
If there are very many connections, ``swapping problems'' may occur unless
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> has been configured to use very little memory for each
connection. <CODE>mysqld</CODE> performs better if you have enough memory for all
connections, of course.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you change an option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, it remains in effect only
for that instance of the server.

</P>
<P>
To see the effects of a parameter change, do something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld -O key_buffer=32m --help
</PRE>

<P>
Make sure that the <CODE>--help</CODE> option is last; otherwise, the effect of any
options listed after it on the command-line will not be reflected in the
output.

Most of the following tests are done on Linux with the
MySQL benchmarks, but they should give some indication for
other operating systems and workloads.

</P>
<P>
You get the fastest executable when you link with <CODE>-static</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Linux, you will get the fastest code when compiling with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>
and <CODE>-O3</CODE>. To compile <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> with these options, you
need about 200M memory because <CODE>gcc/pgcc</CODE> needs a lot of memory to
make all functions inline. You should also set <CODE>CXX=gcc</CODE> when
configuring MySQL to avoid inclusion of the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>
library (it is not needed). Note that with some versions of <CODE>pgcc</CODE>,
the resulting code will only run on true Pentium processors, even if you
use the compiler option that you want the resulting code to be working on
all x586 type processors (like AMD).

</P>
<P>
By just using a better compiler and/or better compiler options you can
get a 10-30% speed increase in your application.  This is particularly
important if you compile the SQL server yourself!

</P>
<P>
We have tested both the Cygnus CodeFusion and Fujitsu compilers, but
when we tested them, neither was sufficiently bug free to allow
MySQL to be compiled with optimisations on.

</P>
<P>
When you compile MySQL you should only include support for the
character sets that you are going to use. (Option <CODE>--with-charset=xxx</CODE>.)
The standard MySQL binary distributions are compiled with support
for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of some measurements that we have done:

<UL>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>pgcc</CODE> and compile everything with <CODE>-O6</CODE>, the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is 1% faster than with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2.

<LI>

If you link dynamically (without <CODE>-static</CODE>), the result is 13%
slower on Linux.  Note that you still can use a dynamic linked
MySQL library. It is only the server that is critical for
performance.

<LI>

If you strip your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary with <CODE>strip libexec/mysqld</CODE>,
the resulting binary can be up to 4% faster.

<LI>

If you connect using TCP/IP rather than Unix sockets, the result is 7.5%
slower on the same computer. (If you are connection to <CODE>localhost</CODE>,
MySQL will, by default, use sockets.)

<LI>

If you connect using TCP/IP from another computer over a 100M Ethernet,
things will be 8-11% slower.

<LI>

When running our benchmark tests using secure connections (all data
encrypted with internal SSL support) things were 55% slower.

<LI>

If you compile with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, you will lose 20% for
most queries. Some queries may take substantially longer (for example,
the MySQL benchmarks ran 35% slower).  If you use <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>,
then you will only lose 15%.  For a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version that has
been compiled with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, you can disable memory
checking at runtime by starting it with the <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE>
option. The end result in this case should be close to when configuring
with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>.

<LI>

On a Sun UltraSPARC-IIe, Forte 5.0 is 4% faster than <CODE>gcc</CODE> 3.2

<LI>

On a Sun UltraSPARC-IIe, Forte 5.0 is 4% faster in 32 bit mode than in
64 bit mode.

<LI>

Compiling with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 for UltraSPARC with the option
<CODE>-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa</CODE> gives 4% more performance.

<LI>

On Solaris 2.5.1, MIT-pthreads is 8-12% slower than Solaris native
threads on a single processor. With more load/CPUs the difference should
get bigger.

<LI>

Running with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> makes mysqld 1% slower.

<LI>

Compiling on Linux-x86 using gcc without frame pointers
<CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE> or <CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer -ffixed-ebp</CODE>
makes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> 1-4% faster.
</UL>

<P>
The MySQL-Linux distribution provided by MySQL AB used
to be compiled with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>, but we had to go back to regular gcc
because of a bug in <CODE>pgcc</CODE> that would generate the code that does
not run on AMD. We will continue using gcc until that bug is resolved.
In the meantime, if you have a non-AMD machine, you can get a faster
binary by compiling with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>.  The standard MySQL
Linux binary is linked statically to get it faster and more portable.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Memory_use" HREF="manual_toc.html#Memory_use">5.5.4  How MySQL Uses Memory</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX957"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following list indicates some of the ways that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
uses memory.  Where applicable, the name of the server variable relevant
to the memory use is given:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The key buffer (variable <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>) is shared by all
threads; other buffers used by the server are allocated as
needed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<LI>

Each connection uses some thread-specific space: A stack (default 64K,
variable <CODE>thread_stack</CODE>), a connection buffer (variable
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>), and a result buffer (variable
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>). The connection buffer and result buffer are
dynamically enlarged up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> when needed.  When
a query is running, a copy of the current query string is also allocated.

<LI>

All threads share the same base memory.

<LI>

Only the compressed <CODE>ISAM</CODE> / <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are memory mapped.  This
is because the 32-bit memory space of 4 GB is not large enough for most
big tables. When systems with a 64-bit address space become more
common we may add general support for memory mapping.

<LI>

Each request doing a sequential scan over a table allocates a read buffer
(variable <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>).

<LI>

When reading rows in 'random' order (for example after a sort) a
random-read buffer is allocated to avoid disk seeks.
(variable <CODE>read_rnd_buffer_size</CODE>).

<LI>

All joins are done in one pass, and most joins can be done without even
using a temporary table. Most temporary tables are memory-based (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>)
tables.  Temporary tables with a big record length (calculated as the
sum of all column lengths) or that contain <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns are
stored on disk.

One problem in MySQL versions before Version 3.23.2 is that if a <CODE>HEAP</CODE>
table exceeds the size of <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>, you get the error <CODE>The
table tbl_name is full</CODE>. In newer versions this is handled by
automatically changing the in-memory (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>) table to a disk-based
(<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>) table as necessary. To work around this problem, you can
increase the temporary table size by setting the <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, or by setting the SQL option
<CODE>BIG_TABLES</CODE> in the client program.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>. In MySQL Version 3.20, the maximum size of the
temporary table was <CODE>record_buffer*16</CODE>, so if you are using this
version, you have to increase the value of <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>. You can
also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--big-tables</CODE> option to always
store temporary tables on disk. However, this will affect the speed of
many complicated queries.

<LI>

Most requests doing a sort allocates a sort buffer and 0-2 temporary
files depending on the result set size. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A>.

<LI>

Almost all parsing and calculating is done in a local memory store. No
memory overhead is needed for small items and the normal slow memory
allocation and freeing is avoided. Memory is allocated only for
unexpectedly large strings (this is done with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and
<CODE>free()</CODE>).

<LI>

Each index file is opened once and the datafile is opened once for each
concurrently running thread. For each concurrent thread, a table structure,
column structures for each column, and a buffer of size <CODE>3 * n</CODE> is
allocated (where <CODE>n</CODE> is the maximum row length, not counting <CODE>BLOB</CODE>
columns). A <CODE>BLOB</CODE> uses 5 to 8 bytes plus the length of the <CODE>BLOB</CODE>
data. The <CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> storage engines will use one extra row
buffer for internal usage.

<LI>

For each table having <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns, a buffer is enlarged dynamically
to read in larger <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values. If you scan a table, a buffer as large
as the largest <CODE>BLOB</CODE> value is allocated.

<LI>

Storage engines for all in-use tables are saved in a cache and managed as a
FIFO. Normally the cache has 64 entries. If a table has been used by two
running threads at the same time, the cache contains two entries for the
table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.7  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.

<LI>

A <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> command closes all tables that are not in
use and marks all in-use tables to be closed when the currently executing
thread finishes. This will effectively free most in-use memory.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>ps</CODE> and other system status programs may report that <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
uses a lot of memory. This may be caused by thread-stacks on different
memory addresses. For example, the Solaris version of <CODE>ps</CODE> counts
the unused memory between stacks as used memory. You can verify this by
checking available swap with <CODE>swap -s</CODE>. We have tested
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with commercial memory-leakage detectors, so there should
be no memory leaks.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX958"></A>
<A NAME="IDX959"></A>

</P>
<P>
When a new thread connects to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will spawn a
new thread to handle the request.  This thread will first check if the
hostname is in the hostname cache. If not the thread will call
<CODE>gethostbyaddr_r()</CODE> and <CODE>gethostbyname_r()</CODE> to resolve the
hostname.

</P>
<P>
If the operating system doesn't support the above thread-safe calls, the
thread will lock a mutex and call <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> and
<CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE> instead. Note that in this case no other thread
can resolve other hostnames that is not in the hostname cache until the
first thread is ready.

</P>
<P>
You can disable DNS host lookup by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>.  In this case you can however only use IP
names in the MySQL privilege tables.

</P>
<P>
If you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you can get more performance by
either disabling DNS lookop with <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> or by
increasing the <CODE>HOST_CACHE_SIZE</CODE> define (default: 128) and recompile
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can disable the hostname cache with <CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>. You
can clear the hostname cache with <CODE>FLUSH HOSTS</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-hosts</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to allow connections over <CODE>TCP/IP</CODE>, you can do this
by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>.

In old MySQL versions we allowed the use of the <CODE>SET OPTION</CODE> syntax,
but this syntax is now deprecated.

<P>
In MySQL 4.0.3 we added the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> and <CODE>SESSION</CODE> options
and access to most important startup variables.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> can be used as a synonym for <CODE>SESSION</CODE>.

</P>

SET @@global.sort_buffer_size=1000000, @@local.sort_buffer_size=1000000;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>@@variable_name</CODE> syntax is supported to make MySQL syntax
compatible with some other databases.

</P>
<P>
The different system variables one can set are described in the system
variable section of this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#System_Variables">6.1.5  System Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>SESSION</CODE> (the default) the option you set remains
in effect until the current session ends, or until you set the option to
a different value. If you use <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE>, which require the
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege, the option is remembered and used for new
connections until the server restarts. If you want to make an option
permanent, you should set it in one of the MySQL option
files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
To avoid wrong usage MySQL will give an error if you use <CODE>SET
GLOBAL</CODE> with a variable that can only be used with <CODE>SET SESSION</CODE> or if
you are not using <CODE>SET GLOBAL</CODE> with a global variable.

</P>
<P>
If you want to set a <CODE>SESSION</CODE> variable to the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> value or a
<CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> value to the MySQL default value, you can set it to
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>

<P>
This is identical to:

</P>

<P>
If you want to restrict the maximum value a startup option can be set to
with the <CODE>SET</CODE> command, you can specify this by using the
<CODE>--maximum-variable-name</CODE> command line option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get a list of most variables with <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.  You can get the value for a specific value with
the <CODE>@@[global.|local.]variable_name</CODE> syntax:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CHARACTER SET character_set_name | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
This maps all strings from and to the client with the given mapping.
Currently the only option for <CODE>character_set_name</CODE> is
<CODE>cp1251_koi8</CODE>, but you can easily add new mappings by editing the
<TT>`sql/convert.cc'</TT> file in the MySQL source distribution.  The
default mapping can be restored by using a <CODE>character_set_name</CODE> value of
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

Note that the syntax for setting the <CODE>CHARACTER SET</CODE> option differs
from the syntax for setting the other options.

<DT><CODE>PASSWORD = PASSWORD('some password')</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX962"></A>
Set the password for the current user. Any non-anonymous user can change his
own password!

<DT><CODE>PASSWORD FOR user = PASSWORD('some password')</CODE>
<DD>
Set the password for a specific user on the current server host. Only a user
with access to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can do this.  The user should be
given in <CODE>user@hostname</CODE> format, where <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>hostname</CODE>
are exactly as they are listed in the <CODE>User</CODE> and <CODE>Host</CODE> columns of
the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table entry.  For example, if you had an entry with
<CODE>User</CODE> and <CODE>Host</CODE> fields of <CODE>'bob'</CODE> and <CODE>'%.loc.gov'</CODE>,
you would write:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR bob@"%.loc.gov" = PASSWORD("newpass");
</PRE>

Which is equivalent to:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE mysql.user SET password=PASSWORD("newpass")
    -&#62;                   WHERE user="bob" AND host="%.loc.gov";
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE> (default) then one can find the last inserted row
for a table with an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with the following construct:
<CODE>WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL</CODE>.  This is used by some
ODBC programs like Access.

<DT><CODE>AUTOCOMMIT= 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE> all changes to a table will be done at once. To start
a multi-command transaction, you have to use the <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE>, <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>. If set to <CODE>0</CODE> you have to use <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> /
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> to accept/revoke that transaction. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE>, <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.  Note
that when you change from not <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode to
<CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, MySQL will do an automatic
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> on any open transactions.

<DT><CODE>BIG_TABLES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX963"></A>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, all temporary tables are stored on disk rather than in
memory.  This will be a little slower, but you will not get the error
<CODE>The table tbl_name is full</CODE> for big <CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations that
require a large temporary table.  The default value for a new connection is
<CODE>0</CODE> (that is, use in-memory temporary tables).
This option was before named <CODE>SQL_BIG_TABLES</CODE>.  In MySQL 4.0 you should
normally never need this flag as MySQL will automatically convert in memory
tables to disk based ones if need.

<DT><CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, MySQL will abort if a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is attempted
that probably will take a very long time, which is defined as if the number
of examined rows is probably going to be bigger than <CODE>MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE>.
This is useful when an inadvisable <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement has been
issued. A big query is defined as a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that probably will
have to examine more than <CODE>max_join_size</CODE> rows.  The default value
for a new connection is <CODE>1</CODE> (which will allow all <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements).

If you set <CODE>MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE> to another value than <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>
<CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE> will be set to 0.

<DT><CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> will force the result from <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s
to be put into a temporary table. This will help MySQL free the
table locks early and will help in cases where it takes a long time to
send the result set to the client.

<DT><CODE>LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, all <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and
<CODE>LOCK TABLE WRITE</CODE> statements wait until there is no pending
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>LOCK TABLE READ</CODE> on the affected table.
This option was before named <CODE>SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>MAX_JOIN_SIZE = value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s that will probably need to examine more than
<CODE>value</CODE> row combinations or is likely to do more than <CODE>value</CODE>
disk seeks.  By setting this value, you can catch <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s where
keys are not used properly and that would probably take a long
time. Setting this to a value other than <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> will reset the
<CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE> flag.  If you set the <CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE> flag
again, the <CODE>SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE> variable will be ignored.  You can
set a default value for this variable by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O max_join_size=#</CODE>.  This option was before named
<CODE>SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE>.

Note that if the result of the query is already in the query cache, the
above check will not be made. Instead, MySQL will send the result to the
client. Since the query result is already computed and it will not burden
the server to send the result to the client.

<DT><CODE>QUERY_CACHE_TYPE = OFF | ON | DEMAND</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>QUERY_CACHE_TYPE = 0   | 1  | 2</CODE>

</TABLE>

<DT><CODE>SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, MySQL will abort if an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> is attempted that doesn't use a key or <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> in the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. This makes it possible to catch wrong updates
when creating SQL commands by hand.

<DT><CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT = value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of records to return from <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  If
a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> has a <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> takes precedence
over the value of <CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT</CODE>.  The default value for a new
connection is ``unlimited.'' If you have changed the limit, the default value
can be restored by using a <CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT</CODE> value of <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_OFF = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, no logging is done to the standard log for this
client, if the client has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_BIN = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, no logging is done to the binary log for the client,
if the client has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_UPDATE = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, no logging is done to the update log for the client,
if the client has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.
This variable is deprecated starting from version 5.0.

<DT><CODE>SQL_QUOTE_SHOW_CREATE = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> will quote
table and column names. This is <STRONG>on</STRONG> by default,
for replication of tables with fancy column names to work.
section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_CREATE_TABLE">4.5.7.8  <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>TIMESTAMP = timestamp_value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Set the time for this client.  This is used to get the original timestamp if
you use the binary log to restore rows.  <CODE>timestamp_value</CODE> should be a
Unix epoch timestamp, not a MySQL timestamp.

<DT><CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID = #</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value to be returned from <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>. This is stored in
the binary log when you use <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> in a command that updates
a table.

<DT><CODE>INSERT_ID = #</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value to be used by the following <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As mentioned before, disks seeks are a big performance bottleneck. This
problems gets more and more apparent when the data starts to grow so
large that effective caching becomes impossible. For large databases,
where you access data more or less randomly, you can be sure that you
will need at least one disk seek to read and a couple of disk seeks to
write things. To minimise this problem, use disks with low seek times.

<LI>

Increase the number of available disk spindles (and thereby reduce
the seek overhead) by either symlink files to different disks or striping
the disks.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Using symbolic links</STRONG>
<DD>
This means that you symlink the index and/or datafile(s) from the
normal data directory to another disk (that may also be striped). This
makes both the seek and read times better (if the disks are not used for
other things). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links">5.6.1  Using Symbolic Links</A>.

<A NAME="IDX966"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Striping</STRONG>
<DD>
Striping means that you have many disks and put the first block on the
first disk, the second block on the second disk, and the Nth on the
(N mod number_of_disks) disk, and so on. This means if your normal data
size is less than the stripe size (or perfectly aligned) you will get
much better performance. Note that striping is very dependent on the OS
and stripe-size. So benchmark your application with different
stripe-sizes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Custom_Benchmarks">5.1.5  Using Your Own Benchmarks</A>.

Note that the speed difference for striping is <STRONG>very</STRONG> dependent
on the parameters. Depending on how you set the striping parameters and
number of disks you may get a difference in orders of magnitude. Note that
you have to choose to optimise for random or sequential access.
</DL>

<LI>

For reliability you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping + mirroring), but
in this case you will need 2*N drives to hold N drives of data. This is
probably the best option if you have the money for it!  You may, however,
also have to invest in some volume-management software to handle it
efficiently.

<LI>

A good option is to have semi-important data (that can be regenerated)
on RAID 0 disk while storing really important data (like host information
and logs) on a RAID 0+1 or RAID N disk. RAID N can be a problem if you
have many writes because of the time to update the parity bits.

<LI>

You may also set the parameters for the filesystem that the database
uses. One easy change is to mount the filesystem with the noatime
option. That makes it skip the updating of the last access time in the
inode and by this will avoid some disk seeks.

<LI>

On Linux, you can get much more performance (up to 100% under load is
not uncommon) by using <CODE>hdparm</CODE> to configure your disk's interface!  The
following should be quite good <CODE>hdparm</CODE> options for MySQL (and
probably many other applications):


<PRE>
hdparm -m 16 -d 1
</PRE>

Note that the performance/reliability when using the above depends on
your hardware, so we strongly suggest that you test your system
thoroughly after using <CODE>hdparm</CODE>!  Please consult the <CODE>hdparm</CODE>
man page for more information!  If <CODE>hdparm</CODE> is not used wisely,
filesystem corruption may result.  Backup everything before experimenting!

<LI>

On many operating systems you can mount the disks with the <CODE>-o async</CODE>
option to set the filesystem to be updated asynchronously.  If your computer is
reasonably stable, this should give you more performance without sacrificing
too much reliability.  (This flag is on by default on Linux.)

<LI>

If you don't need to know when a file was last accessed (which is not
really useful on a database server), you can mount your filesystems
with the <CODE>-o noatime</CODE> option.

You can move tables and databases from the database directory to other
locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new locations.
You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file
system with more free space or increase the speed of your system by
spreading your tables to different disk.

</P>
<P>
The recommended way to do this, is to just symlink databases to a
different disk and only symlink tables as a last resort.

</P>

<P>
The way to symlink a database is to first create a directory on some
disk where you have free space and then create a symlink to it from
the MySQL database directory.

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mkdir /dr1/databases/test
shell&#62; ln -s /dr1/databases/test mysqld-datadir
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL doesn't support that you link one directory to multiple
databases.  Replacing a database directory with a symbolic link will
work fine as long as you don't make a symbolic link between databases.
Suppose you have a database <CODE>db1</CODE> under the MySQL data
directory, and then make a symlink <CODE>db2</CODE> that points to <CODE>db1</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /path/to/datadir
shell&#62; ln -s db1 db2
</PRE>

<P>
Now, for any table <CODE>tbl_a</CODE> in <CODE>db1</CODE>, there also appears to be
a table <CODE>tbl_a</CODE> in <CODE>db2</CODE>.  If one thread updates <CODE>db1.tbl_a</CODE>
and another thread updates <CODE>db2.tbl_a</CODE>, there will be problems.

</P>
<P>
If you really need this, you must change the following code in
<TT>`mysys/mf_format.c'</TT>:

On Windows you can use internal symbolic links to directories by compiling
MySQL with <CODE>-DUSE_SYMDIR</CODE>. This allows you to put different
databases on different disks. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_symbolic_links">2.6.1.5  Distributing Data Across Different Disks on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.0 you should not symlink tables, if you are not
very careful with them. The problem is that if you run <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> on a symlinked
table, the symlinks will be removed and replaced by the original
files. This happens because the above command works by creating a
temporary file in the database directory and when the command is
complete, replace the original file with the temporary file.

</P>
<P>
You should not symlink tables on systems that don't have a fully
working <CODE>realpath()</CODE> call. (At least Linux and Solaris support
<CODE>realpath()</CODE>)

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0 symlinks are fully supported only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.  For other table types you will probably get strange problems
when doing any of the above mentioned commands.

</P>
<P>
The handling of symbolic links in MySQL 4.0 works the following
way (this is mostly relevant only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables).

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In the data directory you will always have the table definition file
and the data and index files.

<LI>

You can symlink the index file and the datafile to different directories
independently of the other.

<LI>

The symlinking can be done from the operating system (if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is
not running) or with the <CODE>INDEX/DATA DIRECTORY="path-to-dir"</CODE> command
in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will not replace a symlink with the data or index file but
work directly on the file the symlink points to. Any temporary files
will be created in the same directory where the data or index file is
located.

<LI>

When you drop a table that is using symlinks, both the symlink and the
file the symlink points to are dropped.  This is a good reason to why you
should <STRONG>not</STRONG> run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE> or allow
persons to have write access to the MySQL database directories.

<LI>

If you rename a table with <CODE>ALTER TABLE RENAME</CODE> and you don't move
the table to another database, the symlinks in the database directory
will be renamed to the new names and the data and index files will be
renamed accordingly.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE RENAME</CODE> to move a table to another database,
the table will be moved to the other database directory and the old
symlinks and the files they pointed to will be deleted.  (In other words,
the new table will not be symlinked.)

<LI>

If you are not using symlinks, you should use the <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to ensure that no one can drop or rename a file
outside of the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> data directory.

A string is a sequence of characters, surrounded by either single quote

<PRE>
'a string'
"another string"

Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning.  Each of these
sequences begins with a backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>), known as the <EM>escape
character</EM>.  MySQL recognises the following escape sequences:

<LI>

A <SAMP>`''</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> needs no special treatment

Alternatively, many MySQL APIs provide some sort of placeholder capability

<CODE>CAST( ... AS UNSIGNED)</CODE> on the hexadecimal value.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>x'hexstring'</CODE> syntax (new in 4.0) is based on standard SQL and the
<CODE>0x</CODE> syntax is based on ODBC.  Hexadecimal strings are often used by
ODBC to supply values for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns.
You can convert a string or a number to string in hexadecimal format with
the <CODE>HEX()</CODE> function.

Note that in addition to the above, you can't have ASCII(0) or ASCII(255) or

<P>
Note that if the identifier is a restricted word or contains special characters
you must always quote it with a <CODE>`</CODE> (backtick) when you use it:

</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reserved_words">6.1.7  Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words?</A>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL versions prior to 3.23.6, the name rules are as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A name may consist of alphanumeric characters from the current character set
and also <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>. The default character set is ISO-8859-1
Latin1; this may be changed with the <CODE>--default-character-set</CODE> option
to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<LI>

A name may start with any character that is legal in a name.  In particular,
a name may start with a digit (this differs from many other database
systems!).  However, a name cannot consist <EM>only</EM> of digits.

<LI>

You cannot use the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character in names because it is used to extend the
format by which you can refer to columns (see immediately below).
</UL>

<P>
It is recommended that you do not use names like <CODE>1e</CODE>, because
an expression like <CODE>1e+1</CODE> is ambiguous. It may be interpreted as the
expression <CODE>1e + 1</CODE> or as the number <CODE>1e+1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL you can refer to a column using any of the following forms:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column reference</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE>
from whichever table used in the query contains a column of that name.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>tbl_name.col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE> from table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> of the current database.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE> from table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> of the database <CODE>db_name</CODE>.  This form is available in
MySQL Version 3.22 or later.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<CODE>`column_name`</CODE> </TD><TD> A column that is a keyword or contains special characters.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You need not specify a <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> or <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> prefix for
a column reference in a statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.
For example, suppose tables <CODE>t1</CODE> and <CODE>t2</CODE> each contain a column
<CODE>c</CODE>, and you retrieve <CODE>c</CODE> in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement that uses
both <CODE>t1</CODE> and <CODE>t2</CODE>.  In this case, <CODE>c</CODE> is ambiguous because it
is not unique among the tables used in the statement, so you must indicate
which table you mean by writing <CODE>t1.c</CODE> or <CODE>t2.c</CODE>.  Similarly, if
you are retrieving from a table <CODE>t</CODE> in database <CODE>db1</CODE> and from a
table <CODE>t</CODE> in database <CODE>db2</CODE>, you must refer to columns in those
tables as <CODE>db1.t.col_name</CODE> and <CODE>db2.t.col_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1026"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1027"></A>
The syntax <CODE>.tbl_name</CODE> means the table <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in the current
database.  This syntax is accepted for ODBC compatibility, because some ODBC
programs prefix table names with a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Name_case_sensitivity" HREF="manual_toc.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A></H3>

</P>
<P>
In MySQL, databases and tables correspond to directories and files
within those directories.  Consequently, the case-sensitivity of the
underlying operating system determines the case-sensitivity of database and
table names.  This means database and table names are case-insensitive in
Windows, and case-sensitive in most varieties of Unix. One prominent
exception here is Mac OS X, when the default HFS+ file system is being used.
However Mac OS X also supports UFS volumes, those are case sensitive on Mac
OS X just like they are on any Unix.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">1.7.3  MySQL Extensions to the SQL-92 Standard</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: although database and table names are case-insensitive for
Windows, you should not refer to a given database or table using different
cases within the same query.  The following query would not work because it
refers to a table both as <CODE>my_table</CODE> and as <CODE>MY_TABLE</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;
</PRE>

<P>
Column names and column aliases are case-insensitive in all cases.

</P>
<P>
Aliases on tables are case-sensitive.  The following query would not work
because it refers to the alias both as <CODE>a</CODE> and as <CODE>A</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
    -&#62;                 WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;
</PRE>

<P>
If you have trouble remembering the lettercase for database and table names,
adopt a consistent convention, such as always creating databases and
tables using lowercase names.

</P>
<P>
One way to avoid this problem is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>-O
lower_case_table_names=1</CODE>. By default this option is 1 on Windows and 0 on
Unix.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE> is 1 MySQL will convert all
table names to lowercase on storage and lookup.
(From version 4.0.2, this option also applies to database names.  From
4.1.1 this also applies for table alias).

</P>
<P>
Note that if you change this option, you need to first convert your old
table names to lower case before starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you move <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> files from a Windows to a Unix disk, you may
in some cases need to use the <TT>`mysql_fix_extensions'</TT> tool to fix-up
the case of the file extensions in each specified database directory
(lowercase <TT>`.frm'</TT>, uppercase <TT>`.MYI'</TT> and <TT>`.MYD'</TT>).
<TT>`mysql_fix_extensions'</TT> can be found in the <TT>`scripts'</TT> subdirectory.

<A NAME="IDX1034"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1035"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1036"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports connection-specific user variables with the
<CODE>@variablename</CODE> syntax.  A variable name may consist of
alphanumeric characters from the current character set and also
<SAMP>`_'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> . The default character set is
ISO-8859-1 Latin1; this may be changed with the
<CODE>--default-character-set</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>. User variable names are case insensitive in versions &#62;= 5.0, case
sensitive in versions &#60; 5.0.

</P>
<P>
Variables don't have to be initialised.  They contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> by default
and can store an integer, real, or string value.  All variables for
a thread are automatically freed when the thread exits.

</P>
<P>
You can set a variable with the <CODE>SET</CODE> syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
SET @variable= { integer expression | real expression | string expression }
[,@variable= ...].
</PRE>

<P>
You can also assign a value to a variable in statements other than <CODE>SET</CODE>.
However, in this case the assignment operator is <CODE>:=</CODE> rather than
<CODE>=</CODE>, because <CODE>=</CODE> is reserved for comparisons in non-<CODE>SET</CODE>
statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET @t1=0, @t2=0, @t3=0;
mysql&#62; SELECT @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;
+----------------------+------+------+------+
| @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4 | @t1  | @t2  | @t3  |
+----------------------+------+------+------+
|                    5 |    5 |    1 |    4 |
+----------------------+------+------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
User variables may be used where expressions are allowed.  Note that
this does not currently include contexts where a number is explicitly
required, such as in the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement,
or the <CODE>IGNORE number LINES</CODE> clause of a <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, each expression is evaluated
only when it's sent to the client.  This means that in the <CODE>HAVING</CODE>,
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause, you can't refer to an expression
that involves variables that are set in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part. For example,
the following statement will NOT work as expected:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT (@aa:=id) AS a, (@aa+3) AS b FROM table_name HAVING b=5;
</PRE>

<P>
The reason is that <CODE>@aa</CODE> will not contain the value of the current
row, but the value of <CODE>id</CODE> for the previous accepted row.

</P>
<P>
The general rule is to never assign <STRONG>and</STRONG> use the same variable in
the same statement.

</P>
<P>
Another issue with setting a variable and using it in the same statement
is that the default result type of a variable is based on the type of
the variable at the start of the statement.  (A not assigned variable is
assumed to have value <CODE>NULL</CODE> and to be of type STRING).  The
following example illustrates this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET @a="test";
mysql&#62; SELECT @a,(@a:=20) FROM table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
In this case MySQL will report to the client that column 1 is a string
and convert all accesses of <CODE>@a</CODE> to strings, even if @a will be
set to a number for the second row.  After the statement is executed
<CODE>@a</CODE> will be regarded as a number.

</P>
<P>
If you have any problems with this, either avoid to set and use the same
variable in the same statement or set the variable to 0, 0.0 or "" before
you use it.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="System_Variables" HREF="manual_toc.html#System_Variables">6.1.5  System Variables</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX1037"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1038"></A>

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.3 we provide better access to a lot of system
and connection variables. One can change most of them without having to take
down the server.

</P>
<P>
There are two kind of system variables: Thread-specific (or
connection-specific)
variables that are unique to the current connection and global variables
that are used to configure global events.
Global variables also are used to set up the initial values of the
corresponding thread-specific variables for new connections.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all global variables are initialised from command
line arguments and option files.  You can change the value with the
<CODE>SET GLOBAL</CODE> command. When a new thread is created, the thread-specific
variables are initialised from the global variables and they
will not change even if you issue a new <CODE>SET GLOBAL</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
To set the value for a <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> variable, you should use one
of the following syntaxes:
(Here we use <CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE> as an example variable)

</P>

<PRE>
SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size=value;
SET @@global.sort_buffer_size=value;
</PRE>

<P>
To set the value for a <CODE>SESSION</CODE> variable, you can use one of the
following syntaxes:

</P>

<PRE>
SET SESSION sort_buffer_size=value;
SET @@session.sort_buffer_size=value;
SET sort_buffer_size=value;
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't specify <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> or <CODE>SESSION</CODE> then <CODE>SESSION</CODE>
is used. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>SESSION</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To retrieve the value for a <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> variable you can use one of the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT @@global.sort_buffer_size;
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES like 'sort_buffer_size';
</PRE>

<P>
To retrieve the value for a <CODE>SESSION</CODE> variable you can use one of the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT @@session.sort_buffer_size;
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES like 'sort_buffer_size';
</PRE>

<P>
When you <STRONG>retrieve</STRONG> a variable value with the
<CODE>@@variable_name</CODE> syntax and you don't specify <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> or
<CODE>SESSION</CODE> then MySQL will return the thread-specific
(<CODE>SESSION</CODE>) value if it exists.  If not, MySQL will return the
global value.

</P>
<P>
The reason for requiring <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> for setting <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> only
variables but not for retrieving them is to ensure that we don't later
run into problems if we later would introduce a thread-specific variable
with the same name or remove a thread-specific variable.  In this case,
you could accidentally change the state for the server as a whole, rather than
just for your own connection.

</P>
<P>
The following is a full list of all variables that you change and retrieve
and if you can use <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> or <CODE>SESSION</CODE> with them.

Variables that are marked with <CODE>num</CODE> can be given a numerical
value. Variables that are marked with <CODE>bool</CODE> can be set to 0, 1,
<CODE>ON</CODE> or <CODE>OFF</CODE>. Variables that are of type <CODE>enum</CODE> should
normally be set to one of the available values for the variable, but can

<A NAME="IDX1040"></A>

<P>
The MySQL server supports the <CODE># to end of line</CODE>, <CODE>--
to end of line</CODE> and <CODE>/* in-line or multiple-line */</CODE> comment
styles:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+
/*
this is a
multiple-line comment
*/
1;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>--</CODE> (double-dash) comment style requires you to have at
least one space after the second dash!

</P>
<P>
Although the server understands the comment syntax just described,
there are some limitations on the way that the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client
parses <CODE>/* ... */</CODE> comments:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Single-quote and double-quote characters are taken to indicate the beginning
of a quoted string, even within a comment.  If the quote is not matched by a
second quote within the comment, the parser doesn't realise the comment has
ended.  If you are running <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively, you can tell that it
has gotten confused like this because the prompt changes from <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>
to <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> or <CODE>"&#62;</CODE>.

<LI>

A semicolon is taken to indicate the end of the current SQL statement
and anything following it to indicate the beginning of the next statement.
</UL>

<P>
These limitations apply both when you run <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively
and when you put commands in a file and tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its
input from that file with <CODE>mysql &#60; some-file</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>  SQL-99 comment style only if the second dash
is followed by a space. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_comments">1.7.4.7  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Reserved_words" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reserved_words">6.1.7  Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words?</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1041"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1042"></A>

</P>
<P>
A common problem stems from trying to create a table with column names that
use the names of datatypes or functions built into MySQL, such as
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP</CODE>.  You're allowed to do it (for example,
<CODE>ABS</CODE> is allowed as a column name). However, by default, in function
invocations no whitespace is allowed between the function name and the
following <SAMP>`('</SAMP> character, so that a function call can be distinguished from
a reference to a column name.

</P>
<P>
If you start the server with the <CODE>--ansi</CODE> or
<CODE>--sql-mode=IGNORE_SPACE</CODE> option, the server allows function invocations
to have whitespace between a function name and the following <SAMP>`('</SAMP>
character. This causes function names to be treated as reserved words; as a
result, column names that are the same as function names must be quoted as
described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following words are explicitly reserved in MySQL. Most of
them are forbidden by SQL-92 as column and/or table names
(for example, <CODE>GROUP</CODE>).
A few are reserved because MySQL needs them and is
(currently) using a <CODE>yacc</CODE> parser:

MySQL supports a number of column types, which may be grouped into
three categories: numeric types, date and time types, and string (character)
types.  This section first gives an overview of the types available and
summarises the storage requirements for each column type, then provides a
more detailed description of the properties of the types in each category.
The overview is intentionally brief.  The more detailed descriptions should
be consulted for additional information about particular column types, such
as the allowable formats in which you can specify values.

</P>
<P>
The column types supported by MySQL are listed below.
The following code letters are used in the descriptions:

This is a synonym for <CODE>INT</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1060"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A large integer. The signed range is <CODE>-9223372036854775808</CODE> to
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE>. The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to
<CODE>18446744073709551615</CODE>.
Some things you should be aware of with respect to <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> columns:


<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1061"></A>
All arithmetic is done using signed <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
values, so you shouldn't use unsigned big integers larger than
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE> (63 bits) except with bit functions! If you
do that, some of the last digits in the result may be wrong because of
rounding errors when converting the <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> to a <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.

MySQL 4.0 can handle <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> in the following cases:

<UL>
<LI>

Use integers to store big unsigned values in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column.
<LI>

In <CODE>MIN(big_int_column)</CODE> and <CODE>MAX(big_int_column)</CODE>.
<LI>

When using operators (<CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, <CODE>*</CODE>, etc.) where
both operands are integers.
</UL>

<LI>

You can always store an exact integer value in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column by
storing it as a string.  In this case, MySQL will perform a string-to-number
conversion that involves no intermediate double representation.
<LI>

<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> will use <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> arithmetic when
both arguments are integer values!  This means that if you
multiply two big integers (or results from functions that return
integers) you may get unexpected results when the result is larger than
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE>.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1063"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1064"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT(precision) [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A floating-point number.  <CODE>precision</CODE> can be
<CODE>&#60;=24</CODE> for a single-precision floating-point number and between 25
and 53 for a double-precision floating-point number. These types are like
the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> types described immediately below.
<CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> has the same range as the corresponding <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> types, but the display size and number of decimals are undefined.

In MySQL Version 3.23, this is a true floating-point value.  In
earlier MySQL versions, <CODE>FLOAT(precision)</CODE> always has 2 decimals.

Note that using <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> may give you some unexpected problems as
all calculations in MySQL are done with double precision.

<A NAME="IDX1073"></A>
<DT><CODE>DECIMAL[(M[,D])] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
An unpacked floating-point number.  Behaves like a
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> column: ``unpacked'' means the number is stored as a string,
using one character for each digit of the value.  The decimal point and,
for negative numbers, the <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> sign, are not counted in <CODE>M</CODE> (but
space for these is reserved). If <CODE>D</CODE> is 0, values will have no decimal
point or fractional part.  The maximum range of <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> values is
the same as for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, but the actual range for a given
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> column may be constrained by the choice of <CODE>M</CODE> and
<CODE>D</CODE>.  If <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> is specified, negative values are disallowed.  

If <CODE>D</CODE> is omitted, the default is 0.  If <CODE>M</CODE> is omitted, the
default is 10.

Prior to MySQL Version 3.23, the <CODE>M</CODE> argument must include the space
needed for the sign and the decimal point.

<A NAME="IDX1077"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATE</CODE>
<DD>
A date.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31'</CODE>.
MySQL displays <CODE>DATE</CODE> values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> format, but
allows you to assign values to <CODE>DATE</CODE> columns using either strings or
numbers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1078"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
<DD>
A date and time combination.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01
00:00:00'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31 23:59:59'</CODE>.  MySQL displays
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format, but allows you
to assign values to <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns using either strings or numbers.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1079"></A>
<DT><CODE>TIMESTAMP[(M)]</CODE>
<DD>
A timestamp.  The range is <CODE>'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> to sometime in the
year <CODE>2037</CODE>.

In MySQL 4.0 and earlier, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are displayed in
<CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>, <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>, <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>, or <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>
format, depending on whether <CODE>M</CODE> is <CODE>14</CODE> (or missing), <CODE>12</CODE>,
<CODE>8</CODE>, or <CODE>6</CODE>, but allows you to assign values to <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
columns using either strings or numbers.

From MySQL 4.1, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is returned as a string with the format
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE>. If you want to have this as a number you
should add +0 to the timestamp column. Different timestamp lengths are
not supported. From version 4.0.12, the <CODE>--new</CODE> option can be used
to make the server behave as in version 4.1.

A <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is useful
for recording the date and time of an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
operation because it is automatically set to the date and time of the most
recent operation if you don't give it a value yourself.  You can also set it
to the current date and time by assigning it a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.

The <CODE>M</CODE> argument affects only how a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is displayed;
its values always are stored using 4 bytes each.

Note that <CODE>TIMESTAMP(M)</CODE> columns where <CODE>M</CODE> is 8 or 14 are reported to
be numbers while other <CODE>TIMESTAMP(M)</CODE> columns are reported to be
strings.  This is just to ensure that one can reliably dump and restore
the table with these types!

<A NAME="IDX1080"></A>
<DT><CODE>TIME</CODE>
<DD>
A time.  The range is <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> to <CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.
MySQL displays <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format, but
allows you to assign values to <CODE>TIME</CODE> columns using either strings or
numbers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TIME">6.2.2.3  The <CODE>TIME</CODE> Type</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1081"></A>
<DT><CODE>YEAR[(2|4)]</CODE>

A year in 2- or 4-digit format (default is 4-digit).  The allowable values
are <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE>, <CODE>0000</CODE> in the 4-digit year format,
and 1970-2069 if you use the 2-digit format (70-69).  MySQL displays
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in <CODE>YYYY</CODE> format, but allows you to assign values to
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> columns using either strings or numbers. (The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> type is
unavailable prior to MySQL Version 3.22.) See section <A HREF="manual.html#YEAR">6.2.2.4  The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> Type</A>.

<DT><CODE>[NATIONAL] CHAR(M) [BINARY]</CODE>
<DD>
A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with spaces to the
specified length when stored. The range of <CODE>M</CODE> is 0 to 255 characters
(1 to 255 prior to MySQL Version 3.23).
Trailing spaces are removed when the value is retrieved. <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values
are sorted and compared in case-insensitive fashion according to the
default character set unless the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> keyword is given.

From version 4.1.0, if the <CODE>M</CODE> value specified is greater than 255,
the column type is converted to <CODE>TEXT</CODE>.
This is a compatibility feature.

<CODE>NATIONAL CHAR</CODE> (or its equivalent short form, <CODE>NCHAR</CODE>) is the
SQL-99 way to define that a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> column should use the default
CHARACTER set.  This is the default in MySQL.

<CODE>CHAR</CODE> is a shorthand for <CODE>CHARACTER</CODE>.

MySQL allows you to create a column of type
<CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE>. This is mainly useful when you have to be compliant with
some old applications that depend on the existence of a column but that do not
actually use the value.  This is also quite nice when you need a
column that only can take 2 values: A <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE>, that is not defined
as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, will occupy only one bit and can take only 2 values:
<CODE>NULL</CODE> or <CODE>""</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHAR">6.2.3.1  The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> Types</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Numeric_types" HREF="manual_toc.html#Numeric_types">6.2.1  Numeric Types</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL supports all of the SQL-92 numeric datatypes.  These
types include the exact numeric datatypes (<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>,
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, and <CODE>SMALLINT</CODE>), as well as the
approximate numeric datatypes (<CODE>FLOAT</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and
<CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>). The keyword <CODE>INT</CODE> is a synonym for
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, and the keyword <CODE>DEC</CODE> is a synonym for
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> and <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> types are implemented as the same
type by MySQL, as permitted by the SQL-92 standard.  They are
used for values for which it is important to preserve exact precision,
for example with monetary data.  When declaring a column of one of these
types the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified; for
example:

</P>

<PRE>
    salary DECIMAL(5,2)
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, <CODE>5</CODE> (<CODE>precision</CODE>) represents the number of
significant decimal digits that will be stored for values, and <CODE>2</CODE>
(<CODE>scale</CODE>) represents the number of digits that will be stored
following the decimal point.  In this case, therefore, the range of
values that can be stored in the <CODE>salary</CODE> column is from
<CODE>-99.99</CODE> to <CODE>99.99</CODE>.
(MySQL can actually store numbers up to <CODE>999.99</CODE> in this column
because it doesn't have to store the sign for positive numbers)

</P>
<P>
In SQL-92, the syntax <CODE>DECIMAL(p)</CODE> is equivalent to
<CODE>DECIMAL(p,0)</CODE>.  Similarly, the syntax <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> is equivalent
to <CODE>DECIMAL(p,0)</CODE>, where the implementation is allowed to decide
the value of <CODE>p</CODE>.  MySQL does not currently support either of these
variant forms of the <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>/<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> datatypes.  This is
not generally a serious problem, as the principal benefits of these
types derive from the ability to control both precision and scale
explicitly.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values are stored as strings, rather
than as binary floating-point numbers, in order to preserve the decimal
precision of those values.  One character is used for each digit of the
value, the decimal point (if <CODE>scale</CODE> &#62; 0), and the <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> sign
(for negative numbers).  If <CODE>scale</CODE> is 0, <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and
<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values contain no decimal point or fractional part.

</P>
<P>
The maximum range of <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values is the
same as for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, but the actual range for a given
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> or <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> column can be constrained by the
<CODE>precision</CODE> or <CODE>scale</CODE> for a given column.  When such a column
is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than
are allowed by the specified <CODE>scale</CODE>, the value is rounded to that
<CODE>scale</CODE>.  When a <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> or <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> column is
assigned a value whose magnitude exceeds the range implied by the
specified (or defaulted) <CODE>precision</CODE> and <CODE>scale</CODE>,
MySQL stores the value representing the corresponding end
point of that range.

</P>
<P>
As an extension to the SQL-92 standard, MySQL also
supports the integer types <CODE>TINYINT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, and
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> as listed in the tables above.  Another extension is
supported by MySQL for optionally specifying the display width
of an integer value in parentheses following the base keyword for the
type (for example, <CODE>INT(4)</CODE>).  This optional width specification is
used to left-pad the display of values whose width is less than the
width specified for the column, but does not constrain the range of
values that can be stored in the column, nor the number of digits that
will be displayed for values whose width exceeds that specified for the
column.  When used in conjunction with the optional extension attribute
<CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>, the default padding of spaces is replaced with zeroes.
For example, for a column declared as <CODE>INT(5) ZEROFILL</CODE>, a value
of <CODE>4</CODE> is retrieved as <CODE>00004</CODE>.  Note that if you store larger
values than the display width in an integer column, you may experience
problems when MySQL generates temporary tables for some
complicated joins, as in these cases MySQL trusts that the
data did fit into the original column width.

</P>
<P>
All integer types can have an optional (non-standard) attribute
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>.  Unsigned values can be used when you want to allow
only positive numbers in a column and you need a little bigger numeric
range for the column.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.0.2, floating-point types also can be <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>.
As with integer types, this attribute prevents negative values from
being stored in the column.  Unlike the integer types, the upper range
of column values remains the same.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> type is used to represent approximate numeric datatypes.
The SQL-92 standard allows an optional specification of
the precision (but not the range of the exponent) in bits following the
keyword <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> in parentheses.  The MySQL implementation
also supports this optional precision specification.  When the keyword
<CODE>FLOAT</CODE> is used for a column type without a precision
specification, MySQL uses four bytes to store the values.  A
variant syntax is also supported, with two numbers given in parentheses
following the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> keyword.  With this option, the first number
continues to represent the storage requirements for the value in bytes,
and the second number specifies the number of digits to be stored and
displayed following the decimal point (as with <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and
<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>).  When MySQL is asked to store a number for
such a column with more decimal digits following the decimal point than
specified for the column, the value is rounded to eliminate the extra
digits when the value is stored.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>REAL</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> types do not accept
precision specifications.  As an extension to the SQL-92
standard, MySQL recognises <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> as a synonym for the
<CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> type.  In contrast with the standard's
requirement that the precision for <CODE>REAL</CODE> be smaller than that used
for <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>, MySQL implements both as 8-byte
double-precision floating-point values (when not running in ``ANSI mode'').
For maximum portability, code requiring storage of approximate numeric
data values should use <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> with no
specification of precision or number of decimal points.

</P>
<P>
When asked to store a value in a numeric column that is outside the column
type's allowable range, MySQL clips the value to the appropriate
endpoint of the range and stores the resulting value instead.

</P>
<P>
For example, the range of an <CODE>INT</CODE> column is <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> to
<CODE>2147483647</CODE>.  If you try to insert <CODE>-9999999999</CODE> into an
<CODE>INT</CODE> column, the value is clipped to the lower endpoint of the range,
and <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> is stored instead. Similarly, if you try to insert
<CODE>9999999999</CODE>, <CODE>2147483647</CODE> is stored instead.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>INT</CODE> column is <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, the size of the column's
range is the same but its endpoints shift up to <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4294967295</CODE>.
If you try to store <CODE>-9999999999</CODE> and <CODE>9999999999</CODE>,
the values stored in the column become <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4294967296</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Conversions that occur due to clipping are reported as ``warnings'' for
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
multi-row <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.

<H3><A NAME="Date_and_time_types" HREF="manual_toc.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1100"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1101"></A>

</P>

<P>
The date and time types are <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, and <CODE>YEAR</CODE>.  Each of these has a
range of legal values, as well as a ``zero'' value that is used when you
specify a really illegal value.  Note that MySQL allows you to store
certain 'not strictly' legal date values, for example <CODE>1999-11-31</CODE>.
The reason for this is that we think it's the responsibility of the
application to handle date checking, not the SQL servers.  To make the
date checking 'fast', MySQL only checks that the month is in
the range of 0-12 and the day is in the range of 0-31. The above ranges
are defined this way because MySQL allows you to store, in a
<CODE>DATE</CODE> or <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column, dates where the day or month-day
is zero.  This is extremely useful for applications that need to store
a birth-date for which you don't know the exact date. In this case you
simply store the date like <CODE>1999-00-00</CODE> or <CODE>1999-01-00</CODE>.  (You
cannot expect to get a correct value from functions like <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>
or <CODE>DATE_ADD</CODE> for dates like these.)

</P>
<P>
Here are some general considerations to keep in mind when working
with date and time types:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL retrieves values for a given date or time type in a standard
format, but it attempts to interpret a variety of formats for values that
you supply (for example, when you specify a value to be assigned to or
compared to a date or time type).  Nevertheless, only the formats described
in the following sections are supported.  It is expected that you will supply
legal values, and unpredictable results may occur if you use values in other
formats.

<LI>

Although MySQL tries to interpret values in several formats, it
always expects the year part of date values to be leftmost.  Dates must be
given in year-month-day order (for example, <CODE>'98-09-04'</CODE>), rather than
in the month-day-year or day-month-year orders commonly used elsewhere (for
example, <CODE>'09-04-98'</CODE>, <CODE>'04-09-98'</CODE>).

<LI>

MySQL automatically converts a date or time type value to a number
if the value is used in a numeric context, and vice versa.

<LI>

When MySQL encounters a value for a date or time type that is
out of range or otherwise illegal for the type (see the start of this
section), it converts the value to the ``zero'' value for that type.
(The exception is that out-of-range <CODE>TIME</CODE> values are clipped to
the appropriate endpoint of the <CODE>TIME</CODE> range.)  The following table
shows the format of the ``zero'' value for each type:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>``Zero'' value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DATETIME</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>'0000-00-00 00:00:00'</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DATE</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>

<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>00000000000000</CODE> (length depends on display size)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>YEAR</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0000</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI>

The ``zero'' values are special, but you can store or refer to them
explicitly using the values shown in the table.  You can also do this
using the values <CODE>'0'</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE>, which are easier to write.

</P>
<P>
MySQL itself is Y2K-safe (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Year_2000_compliance">1.2.5  Year 2000 Compliance</A>),
but input values presented to MySQL may not be.  Any input
containing 2-digit year values is ambiguous, because the century is unknown.
Such values must be interpreted into 4-digit form because MySQL stores
years internally using four digits.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, and <CODE>YEAR</CODE> types,
MySQL interprets dates with ambiguous year values using the
following rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>00-69</CODE> are converted to <CODE>2000-2069</CODE>.

<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>70-99</CODE> are converted to <CODE>1970-1999</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Remember that these rules provide only reasonable guesses as to what your
data mean.  If the heuristics used by MySQL don't produce the
correct values, you should provide unambiguous input containing 4-digit
year values.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will sort 2-digit <CODE>YEAR/DATE/DATETIME</CODE> types properly.

</P>
<P>
Note also that some functions like <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> will convert a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP/DATE</CODE> to a number. This means that a timestamp with a
2-digit year will not work properly with these functions.  The fix in this
case is to convert the <CODE>TIMESTAMP/DATE</CODE> to 4-digit year format or
use something like <CODE>MIN(DATE_ADD(timestamp,INTERVAL 0 DAYS))</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="DATETIME" HREF="manual_toc.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1106"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> types are related.
This section describes their characteristics, how they are similar, and how
they differ.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> type is used when you need values that contain both date
and time information.  MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format.  The supported range is
<CODE>'1000-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31 23:59:59'</CODE>.  (``Supported''
means that although earlier values might work, there is no guarantee that
they will.)

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATE</CODE> type is used when you need only a date value, without a time
part.  MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>DATE</CODE> values in
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> format.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01'</CODE> to
<CODE>'9999-12-31'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column type provides a type that you can use to
automatically mark <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> operations with the current
date and time.  If you have multiple <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns, only the first
one is updated automatically.

</P>
<P>
Automatic updating of the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column occurs under any of
the following conditions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The column is not specified explicitly in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement.
<LI>

The column is not specified explicitly in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement and some
other column changes value.  (Note that an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> that sets a column
to the value it already has will not cause the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to be
updated, because if you set a column to its current value, MySQL
ignores the update for efficiency.)
<LI>

You explicitly set the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns other than the first may also be set to the current
date and time.  Just set the column to <CODE>NULL</CODE> or to <CODE>NOW()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can set any <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to a value different from the current
date and time by setting it explicitly to the desired value.  This is true
even for the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column.  You can use this property if,
for example, you want a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> to be set to the current date and
time when you create a row, but not to be changed whenever the row is updated
later:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Let MySQL set the column when the row is created.
This will initialise it to the current date and time.

<LI>

When you perform subsequent updates to other columns in the row, set
the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column explicitly to its current value.
</UL>

<P>
On the other hand, you may find it just as easy to use a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
column that you initialise to <CODE>NOW()</CODE> when the row is created and
leave alone for subsequent updates.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values may range from the beginning of 1970 to sometime in
the year 2037, with a resolution of one second.  Values are displayed as
numbers.

</P>
<P>
The format in which MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
values depends on the display size, as illustrated by the following table.  The
`full' <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> format is 14 digits, but <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns may
be created with shorter display sizes:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Display format</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
All <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns have the same storage size, regardless of
display size.  The most common display sizes are 6, 8, 12, and 14.  You can
specify an arbitrary display size at table creation time, but values of 0 or
greater than 14 are coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to
13 are coerced to the next higher even number.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: From version 4.1, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is returned as a string with
the format <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> and different timestamp lengths are
no longer supported.

</P>
<P>
You can specify <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values using
any of a common set of formats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As a string in either <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> or <CODE>'YY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format.  A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed--any punctuation
character may be used as the delimiter between date parts or time parts.
For example, <CODE>'98-12-31 11:30:45'</CODE>, <CODE>'98.12.31 11+30+45'</CODE>,
<CODE>'98/12/31 11*30*45'</CODE>, and <CODE>'98@12@31 11^30^45'</CODE> are
equivalent.

<LI>

As a string in either <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> or <CODE>'YY-MM-DD'</CODE> format.
A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed here, too.  For example, <CODE>'98-12-31'</CODE>,
<CODE>'98.12.31'</CODE>, <CODE>'98/12/31'</CODE>, and <CODE>'98@12@31'</CODE> are
equivalent.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in either <CODE>'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'</CODE> or
<CODE>'YYMMDDHHMMSS'</CODE> format, provided that the string makes sense as a
date.  For example, <CODE>'19970523091528'</CODE> and <CODE>'970523091528'</CODE> are
interpreted as <CODE>'1997-05-23 09:15:28'</CODE>, but <CODE>'971122129015'</CODE> is
illegal (it has a nonsensical minute part) and becomes <CODE>'0000-00-00
00:00:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in either <CODE>'YYYYMMDD'</CODE> or <CODE>'YYMMDD'</CODE>
format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>'19970523'</CODE> and <CODE>'970523'</CODE> are interpreted as
<CODE>'1997-05-23'</CODE>, but <CODE>'971332'</CODE> is illegal (it has nonsensical month
and day parts) and becomes <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in either <CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>19830905132800</CODE> and <CODE>830905132800</CODE> are interpreted as
<CODE>'1983-09-05 13:28:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in either <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>19830905</CODE> and <CODE>830905</CODE> are interpreted as <CODE>'1983-09-05'</CODE>.

<LI>

As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> context, such as
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> or <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Illegal <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are converted
to the ``zero'' value of the appropriate type (<CODE>'0000-00-00 00:00:00'</CODE>,
<CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>, or <CODE>00000000000000</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For values specified as strings that include date part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for month or day values that are less than
<CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'1979-6-9'</CODE> is the same as <CODE>'1979-06-09'</CODE>.  Similarly,
for values specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for hour, minute, or second values that are
less than <CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'1979-10-30 1:2:3'</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>'1979-10-30 01:02:03'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12, or 14 digits long.  If the
number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be in <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> or
<CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format and that the year is given by the first 4
digits.  If the number is 6 or 12 digits long, it is assumed to be in
<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format and that the year is given by the
first 2 digits.  Numbers that are not one of these lengths are interpreted
as though padded with leading zeros to the closest length.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1107"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1108"></A>
Values specified as non-delimited strings are interpreted using their length
as given.  If the string is 8 or 14 characters long, the year is assumed to
be given by the first 4 characters.  Otherwise, the year is assumed to be
given by the first 2 characters.  The string is interpreted from left to
right to find year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values, for as many
parts as are present in the string.  This means you should not use strings
that have fewer than 6 characters.  For example, if you specify <CODE>'9903'</CODE>,
thinking that will represent March, 1999, you will find that MySQL
inserts a ``zero'' date into your table.  This is because the year and month
values are <CODE>99</CODE> and <CODE>03</CODE>, but the day part is missing (zero), so
the value is not a legal date.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns store legal values using the full precision with
which the value was specified, regardless of the display size.  This has
several implications:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Always specify year, month, and day, even if your column types are
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(4)</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP(2)</CODE>.  Otherwise, the value will not
be a legal date and <CODE>0</CODE> will be stored.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to widen a narrow <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column,
information will be displayed that previously was ``hidden''.

<LI>

Similarly, narrowing a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column does not cause information to
be lost, except in the sense that less information is shown when the values
are displayed.

<LI>

Although <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are stored to full precision, the only
function that operates directly on the underlying stored value is
<CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>.  Other functions operate on the formatted retrieved
value.  This means you cannot use functions such as <CODE>HOUR()</CODE> or
<CODE>SECOND()</CODE> unless the relevant part of the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value is
included in the formatted value.  For example, the <CODE>HH</CODE> part of a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is not displayed unless the display size is at least
10, so trying to use <CODE>HOUR()</CODE> on shorter <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
produces a meaningless result.
</UL>

<P>
You can to some extent assign values of one date type to an object
of a different date type.  However, there may be some alteration
of the value or loss of information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you assign a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value to a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
object, the time part of the resulting value is set to <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>,
because the <CODE>DATE</CODE> value contains no time information.

<LI>

If you assign a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value to a <CODE>DATE</CODE>
object, the time part of the resulting value is deleted, because the
<CODE>DATE</CODE> type stores no time information.

<LI>

Remember that although <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
values all can be specified using the same set of formats, the types do not
all have the same range of values.  For example, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
cannot be earlier than <CODE>1970</CODE> or later than <CODE>2037</CODE>.  This means
that a date such as <CODE>'1968-01-01'</CODE>, while legal as a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or
<CODE>DATE</CODE> value, is not a valid <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value and will be
converted to <CODE>0</CODE> if assigned to such an object.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1110"></A>
Be aware of certain pitfalls when specifying date values:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The relaxed format allowed for values specified as strings can be deceiving.
For example, a value such as <CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE> might look like a time value
because of the <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> delimiter, but if used in a date context will be
interpreted as the year <CODE>'2010-11-12'</CODE>.  The value <CODE>'10:45:15'</CODE>
will be converted to <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> because <CODE>'45'</CODE> is not a legal
month.

<LI>

The MySQL server only performs basic checking on the validity of a date:
days <CODE>00-31</CODE>, months <CODE>00-12</CODE>, years <CODE>1000-9999</CODE>.
Any date not within this range will revert to <CODE>0000-00-00</CODE>.
Please note that this still allows you to store invalid dates such as
<CODE>2002-04-31</CODE>. It allows web applications to store data from a form
without further checking. To ensure a date is valid, perform a check in
your application.

<LI>

Year values specified as two digits are ambiguous, because the century is
unknown.  MySQL interprets 2-digit year values using the following
rules:


<UL>
<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>00-69</CODE> are converted to <CODE>2000-2069</CODE>.

<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>70-99</CODE> are converted to <CODE>1970-1999</CODE>.
</UL>

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="TIME" HREF="manual_toc.html#TIME">6.2.2.3  The <CODE>TIME</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1111"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE>
format (or <CODE>'HHH:MM:SS'</CODE> format for large hours values).  <CODE>TIME</CODE>
values may range from <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> to <CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.  The reason
the hours part may be so large is that the <CODE>TIME</CODE> type may be used not
only to represent a time of day (which must be less than 24 hours), but also
elapsed time or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater
than 24 hours, or even negative).

</P>
<P>
You can specify <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in a variety of formats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As a string in <CODE>'D HH:MM:SS.fraction'</CODE> format.  (Note that
MySQL doesn't yet store the fraction for the time column.)  One
can also use one of the following ``relaxed'' syntax:

<CODE>HH:MM:SS.fraction</CODE>, <CODE>HH:MM:SS</CODE>, <CODE>HH:MM</CODE>, <CODE>D HH:MM:SS</CODE>,
<CODE>D HH:MM</CODE>, <CODE>D HH</CODE> or <CODE>SS</CODE>.  Here <CODE>D</CODE> is days between 0-33.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in <CODE>'HHMMSS'</CODE> format, provided that
it makes sense as a time.  For example, <CODE>'101112'</CODE> is understood as
<CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE>, but <CODE>'109712'</CODE> is illegal (it has a nonsensical
minute part) and becomes <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in <CODE>HHMMSS</CODE> format, provided that it makes sense as a time.
For example, <CODE>101112</CODE> is understood as <CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE>.  The following
alternative formats are also understood: <CODE>SS</CODE>, <CODE>MMSS</CODE>,<CODE>HHMMSS</CODE>,
<CODE>HHMMSS.fraction</CODE>.  Note that MySQL doesn't yet store the
fraction part.

<LI>

As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a <CODE>TIME</CODE> context, such as <CODE>CURRENT_TIME</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For <CODE>TIME</CODE> values specified as strings that include a time part
delimiter, it is not necessary to specify two digits for hours, minutes, or
seconds values that are less than <CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'8:3:2'</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>'08:03:02'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Be careful about assigning ``short'' <CODE>TIME</CODE> values to a <CODE>TIME</CODE>
column. Without colons, MySQL interprets values using the
assumption that the rightmost digits represent seconds. (MySQL
interprets <CODE>TIME</CODE> values as elapsed time rather than as time of
day.) For example, you might think of <CODE>'1112'</CODE> and <CODE>1112</CODE> as
meaning <CODE>'11:12:00'</CODE> (12 minutes after 11 o'clock), but
MySQL interprets them as <CODE>'00:11:12'</CODE> (11 minutes, 12 seconds).
Similarly, <CODE>'12'</CODE> and <CODE>12</CODE> are interpreted as <CODE>'00:00:12'</CODE>.
<CODE>TIME</CODE> values with colons, by contrast, are always treated as
time of the day. That is <CODE>'11:12'</CODE> will mean <CODE>'11:12:00'</CODE>,
not <CODE>'00:11:12'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Values that lie outside the <CODE>TIME</CODE> range
but are otherwise legal are clipped to the appropriate
endpoint of the range.  For example, <CODE>'-850:00:00'</CODE> and
<CODE>'850:00:00'</CODE> are converted to <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> and
<CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Illegal <CODE>TIME</CODE> values are converted to <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>.  Note that
because <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> is itself a legal <CODE>TIME</CODE> value, there is no way
to tell, from a value of <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> stored in a table, whether the
original value was specified as <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> or whether it was illegal.

The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> type is a 1-byte type used for representing years.

As a four-digit number in the range <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE>.

<LI>

converted to <CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in the ranges <CODE>2000</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE> and
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>1999</CODE>.

<LI>

As a two-digit number in the range <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>99</CODE>.  Values in the
ranges <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>69</CODE> and <CODE>70</CODE> to <CODE>99</CODE> are converted to
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in the ranges <CODE>2001</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE> and <CODE>1970</CODE>
to <CODE>1999</CODE>.  Note that the range for two-digit numbers is slightly
different from the range for two-digit strings, because you cannot specify zero
directly as a number and have it be interpreted as <CODE>2000</CODE>.  You
<STRONG>must</STRONG> specify it as a string <CODE>'0'</CODE> or <CODE>'00'</CODE> or it will be

<P>
The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> types are similar, but differ in the

</P>
<P>
The length of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> column is fixed to the length that you declare

removed.

</P>
<P>
Values in <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are variable-length strings.  You can
declare a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column to be any length between 1 and 255, just as
for <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns.  However, in contrast to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
values are stored using only as many characters as are needed, plus one byte
to record the length.  Values are not padded; instead, trailing spaces are
removed when values are stored.  (This space removal differs from the SQL-99 
specification.) No case conversion takes place during storage or retrieval.

</P>
<P>
If you assign a value to a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column that
exceeds the column's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

</P>

The following table illustrates the differences between the two types of columns
by showing the result of storing various string values into <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE>

<P>
The values retrieved from the <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR(4)</CODE> columns
will be the same in each case, because trailing spaces are removed from
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns upon retrieval.

</P>
<P>
Values in <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are sorted and compared
in case-insensitive fashion, unless the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute was
specified when the table was created.  The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute means
that column values are sorted and compared in case-sensitive fashion
according to the ASCII order of the machine where the MySQL
server is running. <CODE>BINARY</CODE> doesn't affect how the column is stored
or retrieved.

</P>
<P>
From version 4.1.0, column type <CODE>CHAR BYTE</CODE> is an alias for
<CODE>CHAR BINARY</CODE>. This is a compatibility feature.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute is sticky.  This means that if a column marked
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> is used in an expression, the whole expression is compared as a
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
MySQL may silently change the type of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
column at table creation time.

A <CODE>BLOB</CODE> is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of
data.  The four <CODE>BLOB</CODE> types <CODE>TINYBLOB</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>,
<CODE>MEDIUMBLOB</CODE>, and <CODE>LONGBLOB</CODE> differ only in the maximum length of
the values they can hold.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Storage_requirements">6.2.6  Column Type Storage Requirements</A>.

</P>
<P>
The four <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types <CODE>TINYTEXT</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMTEXT</CODE>,
and <CODE>LONGTEXT</CODE> correspond to the four <CODE>BLOB</CODE> types and have the
same maximum lengths and storage requirements.  The only difference between
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types is that sorting and comparison is performed
in case-sensitive fashion for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values and case-insensitive fashion
for <CODE>TEXT</CODE> values.  In other words, a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> is a case-insensitive
<CODE>BLOB</CODE>. No case conversion takes place during storage or retrieval.

</P>
<P>
If you assign a value to a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column that exceeds
the column type's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

</P>
<P>
In most respects, you can regard a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column as a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
column that can be as big as you like.  Similarly, you can regard a
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> column as a <CODE>VARCHAR BINARY</CODE> column.  The differences are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can have indexes on <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns with
MySQL Version 3.23.2 and newer. Older versions of
MySQL did not support this.

<LI>

There is no trailing-space removal for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns
when values are stored, as there is for <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1122"></A>
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns cannot have <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values.
</UL>

<P>
From version 4.1.0, <CODE>LONG</CODE> and <CODE>LONG VARCHAR</CODE> map to the
<CODE>MEDIUMTEXT</CODE> data type. This is a compatibility feature.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> defines <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values as <CODE>LONGVARBINARY</CODE> and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> values as <CODE>LONGVARCHAR</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Because <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> values may be extremely long, you
may run up against some constraints when using them:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column, you must convert the column value into a fixed-length
object. The standard way to do this is with the <CODE>SUBSTRING</CODE>
function.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT comment FROM tbl_name,SUBSTRING(comment,20) AS substr
    -&#62;                 ORDER BY substr;
</PRE>

If you don't do this, only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes of the
column are used when sorting.  The default value of <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> is
1024; this value can be changed using the <CODE>-O</CODE> option when starting the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server. You can group on an expression involving <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> values by specifying the column position or by using an alias:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,SUBSTRING(blob_col,1,100) FROM tbl_name GROUP BY 2;
mysql&#62; SELECT id,SUBSTRING(blob_col,1,100) AS b FROM tbl_name GROUP BY b;
</PRE>

<LI>

The maximum size of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> object is determined by its
type, but the largest value you can actually transmit between the client and
server is determined by the amount of available memory and the size of the
communications buffers.  You can change the message buffer size
(<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>), but you must
do so on both the server and client ends. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Note that each <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> value is represented
internally by a separately allocated object. This is in contrast to all
other column types, for which storage is allocated once per column when
the table is opened.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="ENUM" HREF="manual_toc.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1123"></A>

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is a string object whose value normally is chosen from a list
of allowed values that are enumerated explicitly in the column specification
at table creation time.

</P>
<P>
The value may also be the empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) or <CODE>NULL</CODE> under
certain circumstances:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you insert an invalid value into an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> (that is, a string not
present in the list of allowed values), the empty string is inserted
instead as a special error value. This string can be distinguished from a
'normal' empty string by the fact that this string has the numerical value
0. More about this later.

<LI>

If an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is declared <CODE>NULL</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is also a legal value
for the column, and the default value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  If an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is
declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, the default value is the first element of the
list of allowed values.
</UL>

<P>
Each enumeration value has an index:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Values from the list of allowable elements in the column specification are
numbered beginning with 1.

<LI>

The index value of the empty string error value is 0.  This means that you
can use the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement to find rows into which invalid
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values were assigned:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE enum_col=0;
</PRE>

<LI>

The index of the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For example, a column specified as <CODE>ENUM("one", "two", "three")</CODE> can
have any of the values shown here.  The index of each value is also shown:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Index</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>NULL</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>NULL</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>""</CODE> </TD><TD> 0
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"one"</CODE> </TD><TD> 1
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"two"</CODE> </TD><TD> 2
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"three"</CODE> </TD><TD> 3
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
An enumeration can have a maximum of 65535 elements.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.51 trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values when the table is created.

</P>
<P>
Lettercase is irrelevant when you assign values to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column.
However, values retrieved from the column later have lettercase matching the
values that were used to specify the allowable values at table creation time.

</P>
<P>
If you retrieve an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> in a numeric context, the column value's
index is returned.  For example, you can retrieve numeric values from
an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT enum_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If you store a number into an <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the number is treated as an
index, and the value stored is the enumeration member with that index.
(However, this will not work with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>, which treats all
input as strings.)
It's not advisable to store numbers in an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> string because
it will make things confusing.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values are sorted according to the order in which the enumeration
members were listed in the column specification.  (In other words,
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values are sorted according to their index numbers.)  For
example, <CODE>"a"</CODE> sorts before <CODE>"b"</CODE> for <CODE>ENUM("a", "b")</CODE>, but
<CODE>"b"</CODE> sorts before <CODE>"a"</CODE> for <CODE>ENUM("b", "a")</CODE>.  The empty
string sorts before non-empty strings, and <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort before
all other enumeration values.
To prevent unexpected results, specify the <CODE>ENUM</CODE> list in alphabetical
order. You can also use <CODE>GROUP BY CONCAT(col)</CODE> to make sure the column
is sorted alphabetically rather than by index number.

</P>
<P>
If you want to get all possible values for an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column, you should
use: <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE enum_column_name</CODE> and parse
the <CODE>ENUM</CODE> definition in the second column.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SET" HREF="manual_toc.html#SET">6.2.3.4  The <CODE>SET</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1124"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>SET</CODE> is a string object that can have zero or more values, each of
which must be chosen from a list of allowed values specified when the table
is created.  <CODE>SET</CODE> column values that consist of multiple set members
are specified with members separated by commas (<SAMP>`,'</SAMP>).  A consequence of
this is that <CODE>SET</CODE> member values cannot themselves contain commas.

</P>
<P>
For example, a column specified as <CODE>SET("one", "two") NOT NULL</CODE> can have
any of these values:

</P>

<PRE>
""
"one"
"two"
"one,two"
</PRE>

<P>
A <CODE>SET</CODE> can have a maximum of 64 different members.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.51 trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
<CODE>SET</CODE> values when the table is created.

</P>
<P>
MySQL stores <CODE>SET</CODE> values numerically, with the low-order bit
of the stored value corresponding to the first set member.  If you retrieve a
<CODE>SET</CODE> value in a numeric context, the value retrieved has bits set
corresponding to the set members that make up the column value.  For example,
you can retrieve numeric values from a <CODE>SET</CODE> column like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT set_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If a number is stored into a <CODE>SET</CODE> column, the bits that
are set in the binary representation of the number determine the
set members in the column value.  Suppose a column is specified as
<CODE>SET("a","b","c","d")</CODE>.  Then the members have the following bit
values:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>SET</CODE> <STRONG>member</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Decimal value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Binary value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>a</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0001</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>b</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>2</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0010</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>c</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>4</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0100</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>d</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>8</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1000</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
If you assign a value of <CODE>9</CODE> to this column, that is <CODE>1001</CODE> in
binary, so the first and fourth <CODE>SET</CODE> value members <CODE>"a"</CODE> and
<CODE>"d"</CODE> are selected and the resulting value is <CODE>"a,d"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For a value containing more than one <CODE>SET</CODE> element, it does not matter
what order the elements are listed in when you insert the value.  It also
does not matter how many times a given element is listed in the value.
When the value is retrieved later, each element in the value will appear
once, with elements listed according to the order in which they were
specified at table creation time.  For example, if a column is specified as
<CODE>SET("a","b","c","d")</CODE>, then <CODE>"a,d"</CODE>, <CODE>"d,a"</CODE>, and
<CODE>"d,a,a,d,d"</CODE> will all appear as <CODE>"a,d"</CODE> when retrieved.

</P>
<P>
If you set a <CODE>SET</CODE> column to an unsupported value, the value will
be ignored.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SET</CODE> values are sorted numerically.  <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort before
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> <CODE>SET</CODE> values.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you perform a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> on a <CODE>SET</CODE> column using
the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> operator or the <CODE>FIND_IN_SET()</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col LIKE '%value%';
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE FIND_IN_SET('value',set_col)&#62;0;
</PRE>

<P>
But the following will also work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col = 'val1,val2';
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col &#38; 1;
</PRE>

<P>
The first of these statements looks for an exact match.  The second looks
for values containing the first set member.

</P>
<P>
If you want to get all possible values for a <CODE>SET</CODE> column, you should
use: <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE set_column_name</CODE> and parse
the <CODE>SET</CODE> definition in the second column.

For the most efficient use of storage, try to use the most precise type in
all cases. For example, if an integer column will be used for values in the
range between <CODE>1</CODE> and <CODE>99999</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED</CODE> is the
best type.

</P>
<P>
Accurate representation of monetary values is a common problem. In
MySQL, you should use the <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> type. This is stored as
a string, so no loss of accuracy should occur. If accuracy is not
too important, the <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> type may also be good enough.

</P>
<P>
For high precision, you can always convert to a fixed-point type stored
in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE>. This allows you to do all calculations with integers
and convert results back to floating-point values only when necessary.

on the type's maximum possible size.  For example, a <CODE>VARCHAR(10)</CODE>
column can hold a string with a maximum length of 10 characters.  The actual
storage required is the length of the string (<CODE>L</CODE>), plus 1 byte to
record the length of the string.  For the string <CODE>'abcd'</CODE>, <CODE>L</CODE> is 4
and the storage requirement is 5 bytes.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types require 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes to record
the length of the column value, depending on the maximum possible length of
the type.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a table includes any variable-length column types, the record format will
also be variable-length.  Note that when a table is created, MySQL
may, under certain conditions, change a column from a variable-length type to a
fixed-length type, or vice-versa.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.

The size of an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> object is determined by the number of
different enumeration values.  One byte is used for enumerations with up
to 255 possible values.  Two bytes are used for enumerations with up to
65535 values. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1142"></A>
The size of a <CODE>SET</CODE> object is determined by the number of different
set members.  If the set size is <CODE>N</CODE>, the object occupies <CODE>(N+7)/8</CODE>
bytes, rounded up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes.  A <CODE>SET</CODE> can have a maximum

A <CODE>select_expression</CODE> or <CODE>where_definition</CODE> in an SQL statement
can consist of any expression using the functions described below.

</P>
<P>
An expression that contains <CODE>NULL</CODE> always produces a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value
unless otherwise indicated in the documentation for the operators and
functions involved in the expression.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: there must be no whitespace between a function name and the
parentheses following it. This helps the MySQL parser distinguish
between function calls and references to tables or columns that happen to
have the same name as a function.  Spaces around arguments are permitted,
though.

</P>
<P>
You can force MySQL to accept spaces after the function name by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--ansi</CODE> or using the
<CODE>CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE</CODE> to <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, but in this case all

Comparison operations result in a value of <CODE>1</CODE> (TRUE), <CODE>0</CODE> (FALSE),
or <CODE>NULL</CODE>. These functions work for both numbers and strings.  Strings
are automatically converted to numbers and numbers to strings as needed (as
in Perl).

</P>
<P>
MySQL performs comparisons using the following
rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If one or both arguments are <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the result of the comparison
is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, except for the <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> operator.

<LI>

If both arguments in a comparison operation are strings, they are compared as
strings.

<LI>

If both arguments are integers, they are compared as integers.

<LI>

Hexadecimal values are treated as binary strings if not compared to a number.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1152"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1153"></A>
If one of the arguments is a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> or <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column and
the other argument is a constant, the constant is converted
to a timestamp before the comparison is performed. This is done to be more
ODBC-friendly.

<LI>

In all other cases, the arguments are compared as floating-point (real)
numbers.
</UL>

<P>
By default, string comparisons are done in case-independent fashion using the
current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default, which also works
excellently for English).

</P>
<P>
If you are comparing case-insensitive strings with any of the standard
operators (<CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>..., but not <CODE>LIKE</CODE>) trailing whitespace 
(spaces, tabs and newlines) will be ignored.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "a" ="A \n";
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<P>
The following examples illustrate conversion of strings to numbers for comparison
operations:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 &#62; '6x';
         -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 7 &#62; '6x';
         -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT 0 &#62; 'x6';
         -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 0 = 'x6';
         -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<P>
Note that when you are comparing a string column with a number, MySQL
can't use index to quickly look up the value:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE string_key=1
</PRE>

<P>
The reason for this is that there is many different strings that may
return the value <CODE>1</CODE>:  <CODE>"1"</CODE>, <CODE>" 1"</CODE>, <CODE>"1a"</CODE> ...

<DT><CODE>expr IN (value,...)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>expr</CODE> is any of the values in the <CODE>IN</CODE> list,
else returns <CODE>0</CODE>.  If all values are constants, then all values are
evaluated according to the type of <CODE>expr</CODE> and sorted. The search for the
item is then done using a binary search. This means <CODE>IN</CODE> is very quick
if the <CODE>IN</CODE> value list consists entirely of constants.  If <CODE>expr</CODE>
is a case-sensitive string expression, the string comparison is performed in
case-sensitive fashion:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 2 IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 'wefwf' IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

The number of values in the <CODE>IN</CODE> list is only limited by the
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> value.

From 4.1 (to comply with the SQL-99 standard), <CODE>IN</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> 
not only if the expression on the left hand side is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, but also if
no match is found in the list and one of the expressions in the list is 
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

In 4.0.6 and above the default result value of
<CODE>IFNULL(expr1,expr2)</CODE> is the more 'general' of the two expressions,
in the order <CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>. The difference
to earlier MySQL versions are mostly notable when you create a table
based on expressions or MySQL has to internally store a value from
<CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> in a temporary table.


<PRE>

In MySQL 4.0.6 the type for column 'test' is <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE> while in

If <CODE>expr2</CODE> or <CODE>expr3</CODE> is explicitely <CODE>NULL</CODE> then the
result type of the <CODE>IF()</CODE> function is the type of the not
<CODE>NULL</CODE> column. (This behaviour is new in MySQL 4.0.3).

<CODE>expr1</CODE> is evaluated as an integer value, which means that if you are
testing floating-point or string values, you should do so using a comparison
operation:


<PRE>

mysql&#62; SELECT IF(0.1&#60;&#62;0,1,0);
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

In the first case above, <CODE>IF(0.1)</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> because <CODE>0.1</CODE>
is converted to an integer value, resulting in a test of <CODE>IF(0)</CODE>.  This
may not be what you expect.  In the second case, the comparison tests the
original floating-point value to see whether it is non-zero.  The result
of the comparison is used as an integer.

The default return type of <CODE>IF()</CODE> (which may matter when it is
stored into a temporary table) is calculated in MySQL Version
3.23 as follows:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Expression</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Return value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns string </TD><TD> string
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns a floating-point value </TD><TD> floating-point
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns an integer </TD><TD> integer
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

If expr2 and expr3 are strings, then the result is case-insensitive if
both strings are case-insensitive. (Starting from 3.23.51)

<DT><CODE>CASE value WHEN [compare-value] THEN result [WHEN [compare-value] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>CASE WHEN [condition] THEN result [WHEN [condition] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END</CODE>
<DD>
The first version returns the <CODE>result</CODE> where
<CODE>value=compare-value</CODE>. The second version returns the result for
the first condition, which is true. If there was no matching result
value, then the result after <CODE>ELSE</CODE> is returned. If there is no
<CODE>ELSE</CODE> part then <CODE>NULL</CODE> is returned:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE 1 WHEN 1 THEN "one"
           WHEN 2 THEN "two" ELSE "more" END;

mysql&#62; SELECT CASE BINARY "B" WHEN "a" THEN 1 WHEN "b" THEN 2 END;
       -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The type of the return value (<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> or
<CODE>STRING</CODE>) is the same as the type of the first returned value (the
expression after the first <CODE>THEN</CODE>).

</PRE>

See also the <CODE>ORD()</CODE> function.

<A NAME="IDX1202"></A>
<DT><CODE>ORD(str)</CODE>
<DD>
If the leftmost character of the string <CODE>str</CODE> is a multi-byte character,
returns the code for that character, calculated from the ASCII code values
of its constituent characters using this formula:
<CODE>((first byte ASCII code)*256+(second byte ASCII code))[*256+third byte ASCII code...]</CODE>.
If the leftmost character is not a multi-byte character, returns the same
value that the <CODE>ASCII()</CODE> function does:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ORD('2');
        -&#62; 50
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1203"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONV(N,from_base,to_base)</CODE>
<DD>
Converts numbers between different number bases.  Returns a string
representation of the number <CODE>N</CODE>, converted from base <CODE>from_base</CODE>
to base <CODE>to_base</CODE>.  Returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> if any argument is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
The argument <CODE>N</CODE> is interpreted as an integer, but may be specified as
an integer or a string.  The minimum base is <CODE>2</CODE> and the maximum base is
<CODE>36</CODE>.  If <CODE>to_base</CODE> is a negative number, <CODE>N</CODE> is regarded as a
signed number.  Otherwise, <CODE>N</CODE> is treated as unsigned.  <CODE>CONV</CODE> works
with 64-bit precision:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONV("a",16,2);
        -&#62; '1010'
mysql&#62; SELECT CONV("6E",18,8);
        -&#62; '172'

<A NAME="IDX1206"></A>
<DT><CODE>HEX(N_or_S)</CODE>
<DD>
If N_OR_S is a number, returns a string representation of the hexadecimal
value of <CODE>N</CODE>, where <CODE>N</CODE> is a longlong (<CODE>BIGINT</CODE>) number.
This is equivalent to <CODE>CONV(N,10,16)</CODE>.

If N_OR_S is a string, returns a hexadecimal string of N_OR_S where each
character in N_OR_S is converted to 2 hexadecimal digits. This is the
invers of the <CODE>0xff</CODE> strings.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT HEX(255);

<DD>
Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments.  Returns
<CODE>NULL</CODE> if any argument is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  May have more than 2 arguments.
A numeric argument is converted to the equivalent string form:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');
        -&#62; 'MySQL'
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT('My', NULL, 'QL');
        -&#62; NULL

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1209"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONCAT_WS(separator, str1, str2,...)</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>CONCAT_WS()</CODE> stands for CONCAT With Separator and is a special form of
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.  The first argument is the separator for the rest of the
arguments. The separator can be a string as well as the rest of the
arguments. If the separator is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the result will be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
The function will skip any <CODE>NULL</CODE> values after the
separator argument. The separator will be added between the strings to be
concatenated:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT_WS(",","First name","Second name","Last Name");
       -&#62; 'First name,Second name,Last Name'
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT_WS(",","First name",NULL,"Last Name");
       -&#62; 'First name,Last Name'

        -&#62; 4
</PRE>

<CODE>LENGTH()</CODE> and <CODE>OCTET_LENGTH()</CODE> are synonyms, and measure string
length in bytes (octets).  A multi-byte character counts as multiple bytes.
<CODE>CHAR_LENGTH()</CODE> and <CODE>CHARACTER_LENGTH()</CODE> are synonyms, and measure
string length in characters.  A multiple-byte character counts as a single
character.
This means that for a string containing five two-byte characters,
<CODE>LENGTH()</CODE> returns <CODE>10</CODE>, whereas <CODE>CHAR_LENGTH()</CODE> returns
<CODE>5</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1214"></A>

<DT><CODE>LOAD_FILE(file_name)</CODE>
<DD>
Reads the file and returns the file contents as a string.  The file
must be on the server, you must specify the full pathname to the
file, and you must have the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege.  The file must
be readable by all and be smaller than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>.

If the file doesn't exist or can't be read due to one of the above reasons,
the function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name
           SET blob_column=LOAD_FILE("/tmp/picture")
           WHERE id=1;
</PRE>

If you are not using MySQL Version 3.23, you have to do the reading
of the file inside your application and create an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
to update the database with the file information. One way to do this, if
you are using the MySQL++ library, can be found at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html</a>.

<A NAME="IDX1247"></A>
<DT><CODE>QUOTE(str)</CODE>

quotes and with each instance of single quote (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>), backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>),
ASCII NUL, and Control-Z preceded by a backslash.  If the argument is
<CODE>NULL</CODE>, the return value is the word ``NULL'' without surrounding
single quotes.
The <CODE>QUOTE</CODE> function was added in MySQL version 4.0.3.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT QUOTE("Don't");

MySQL automatically converts numbers to strings as necessary, and
vice-versa:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+"1";
        -&#62; 2
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(2,' test');
        -&#62; '2 test'
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to convert a number to a string explicitly, pass it as the
argument to <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If a string function is given a binary string as an argument, the resulting
string is also a binary string.  A number converted to a string is treated as
a binary string.  This only affects comparisons.

<DT><CODE>expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1252"></A>
 
Pattern matching using
SQL simple regular expression comparison. Returns <CODE>1</CODE> (TRUE) or <CODE>0</CODE>
(FALSE).  With <CODE>LIKE</CODE> you can use the following two wildcard characters
in the pattern:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Char</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>%</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches any number of characters, even zero characters
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>_</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches exactly one character
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David!' LIKE 'David_';
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David!' LIKE '%D%v%';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

To test for literal instances of a wildcard character, precede the character
with the escape character.  If you don't specify the <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> character,
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> is assumed:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>String</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>\%</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches one <CODE>%</CODE> character
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>\_</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches one <CODE>_</CODE> character
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David!' LIKE 'David\_';
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David_' LIKE 'David\_';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

To specify a different escape character, use the <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> clause:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David_' LIKE 'David|_' ESCAPE '|';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

The following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are
case-insensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'ABC';
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT 'abc' LIKE BINARY 'ABC';
        -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is allowed on numeric expressions! (This is a MySQL
extension to the SQL-99 <CODE>LIKE</CODE>.)


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 10 LIKE '1%';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax in strings (for example,
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>), you must double any <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that you use in your <CODE>LIKE</CODE>
strings.  For example, to search for <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, specify it as <SAMP>`\\n'</SAMP>.  To
search for <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, specify it as <SAMP>`\\\\'</SAMP> (the backslashes are stripped
once by the parser and another time when the pattern match is done, leaving
a single backslash to be matched).

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Currently <CODE>LIKE</CODE> is not <CODE>multi-byte character</CODE> safe.
Comparison is done character by character.

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Regexp">G  MySQL Regular Expressions</A>.  Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>expr</CODE> matches <CODE>pat</CODE>, otherwise
returns <CODE>0</CODE>.  <CODE>RLIKE</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>REGEXP</CODE>, provided for
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> compatibility. Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape
syntax in strings (for example, <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>), you must double any <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that
you use in your <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> strings.  As of MySQL Version 3.23.4,
<CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is case-insensitive for normal (not binary) strings:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'Monty!' REGEXP 'm%y%%';
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 'Monty!' REGEXP '.*';
        -&#62; 1

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1265"></A>
 
The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> operator casts the string following it to a binary string.
This is an easy way to force a column comparison to be case-sensitive even
if the column isn't defined as <CODE>BINARY</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "a" = "A";
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT BINARY "a" = "A";
        -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<CODE>BINARY string</CODE> is a shorthand for <CODE>CAST(string AS BINARY)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.0.

Note that in some context MySQL will not be able to use the
index efficiently when you cast an indexed column to <CODE>BINARY</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
If you want to compare a blob case-insensitively you can always convert
the blob to upper case before doing the comparison:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT 'A' LIKE UPPER(blob_col) FROM table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
We plan to soon introduce casting between different character sets to
make string comparison even more flexible.

<A NAME="IDX1311"></A>
<DT><CODE>RAND()</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>RAND(N)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a random floating-point value in the range <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>1.0</CODE>.
If an integer argument <CODE>N</CODE> is specified, it is used as the seed value
(producing a repeatable sequence):

<PRE>

mysql&#62; SELECT RAND();
        -&#62; 0.70100469486881
</PRE>

You can't use a column with <CODE>RAND()</CODE> values in an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
clause, because <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> would evaluate the column multiple times.
From version 3.23 you can do:
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND()</CODE>

This is useful to get a random sample of a set <CODE>SELECT * FROM
table1,table2 WHERE a=b AND c&#60;d ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1000</CODE>.

Note that a <CODE>RAND()</CODE> in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will be re-evaluated
every time the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is executed.

<CODE>RAND()</CODE> is not meant to be a perfect random generator, but instead a
fast way to generate ad hoc random numbers that will be portable between
platforms for the same MySQL version.

<A NAME="IDX1312"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEAST(X,Y,...)</CODE>
<DD>
With two or more arguments, returns the smallest (minimum-valued) argument.
The arguments are compared using the following rules:


<UL>
<LI>

If the return value is used in an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> context, or all arguments
are integer-valued, they are compared as integers.

<LI>

If the return value is used in a <CODE>REAL</CODE> context, or all arguments are
real-valued, they are compared as reals.

<LI>

If any argument is a case-sensitive string, the arguments are compared
as case-sensitive strings.

<LI>

In other cases, the arguments are compared as case-insensitive strings:
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1316"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRUNCATE(X,D)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number <CODE>X</CODE>, truncated to <CODE>D</CODE> decimals.  If <CODE>D</CODE>
is <CODE>0</CODE>, the result will have no decimal point or fractional part:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(1.223,1);
        -&#62; 1.2
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(1.999,1);
        -&#62; 1.9
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(1.999,0);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(-1.999,1);
        -&#62; -1.9
</PRE>

Starting from MySQL 3.23.51, all numbers are rounded toward zero.

If <CODE>D</CODE> is negative, then the whole part of the number is zeroed out:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(122,-2);
       -&#62; 100
</PRE>

Note that as decimal numbers are normally not stored as exact numbers in
computers, but as double-precision values, you may be fooled by the following
result:

<A NAME="IDX1317"></A>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(10.28*100,0);
       -&#62; 1027
</PRE>

The above happens because 10.28 is actually stored as something like
10.2799999999999999.

<A NAME="IDX1319"></A>

</P>
<P>
This section describes the functions that can be used to manipulate
temporal values.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A> for a description of the range of values
each date and time type has and the valid formats in which values may be
specified.

</P>
<P>
Here is an example that uses date functions.  The following query selects
all records with a <CODE>date_col</CODE> value from within the last 30 days:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT something FROM tbl_name
           WHERE TO_DAYS(NOW()) - TO_DAYS(date_col) &#60;= 30;
</PRE>

<P>
(Note that the query will also select records with dates that lie in the
future.)

</P>
<P>
Functions that expect date values usually will accept datetime values
and ignore the time part. Functions that expect time values usually will
accept datetime values and ignore the date part.

</P>
<P>
Functions that return the current date or time each are evaluated only once
per query at the start of query execution. This means that multiple references
to a function such as <CODE>NOW()</CODE> within a single query will always produce
the same result.  This principle also applies to <CODE>CURDATE()</CODE>,
<CODE>CURTIME()</CODE>, <CODE>UTC_DATE()</CODE>, <CODE>UTC_TIME()</CODE>, <CODE>UTC_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>,
and any of their synonyms.

</P>
<P>
The return value ranges in the following function descriptions apply for
complete dates. If a date is a ``zero'' value or an incomplete date such
as <CODE>'2001-11-00'</CODE>, functions that extract a part of a date may return
<CODE>0</CODE>. For example, <CODE>DAYOFMONTH('2001-11-00')</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1332"></A>
<DT><CODE>WEEK(date)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>WEEK(date,start)</CODE>
<DD>
With a single argument, returns the week for <CODE>date</CODE>, in the range
<CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>53</CODE> (yes, there may be the beginnings of a week 53),
for locations where Sunday is the first day of the week.  The
two-argument form of <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> allows you to specify whether the
week starts on Sunday or Monday and whether the return value should be in
the range <CODE>0-53</CODE> or <CODE>1-52</CODE>.

The following table demonstrates how the <CODE>start</CODE> argument works:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>0</CODE> </TD><TD> Week starts on Sunday; return value range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>53</CODE>

<TR><TD><CODE>1</CODE> </TD><TD> Week starts on Monday; return value range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>53</CODE>

<TR><TD><CODE>2</CODE> </TD><TD> Week starts on Sunday; return value range is <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>53</CODE>

<TR><TD><CODE>3</CODE> </TD><TD> Week starts on Monday; return value range is <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>53</CODE> (ISO 8601)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

The <CODE>start</CODE> value of <CODE>3</CODE> can be used as of MySQL 4.0.5.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20');
        -&#62; 7
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20',0);
        -&#62; 7
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20',1);
        -&#62; 8
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-12-31',1);
        -&#62; 53
</PRE>

For MySQL 3.23 and 4.0, the default value for the <CODE>start</CODE> argument is 0.
In MySQL 4.1, you can control the default value of the <CODE>start</CODE> argument
by using the <CODE>default_week_format</CODE>
variable. The syntax for setting <CODE>default_week_format</CODE> is:


<PRE>
SET [SESSION | GLOBAL] default_week_format = {0|1|2|3};
</PRE>

Note: In Version 4.0, <CODE>WEEK(date,0)</CODE> was changed to match the
calendar in the USA.  Before that, <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> was calculated incorrectly
for dates in USA. (In effect, <CODE>WEEK(date)</CODE> and <CODE>WEEK(date,0)</CODE> was
incorrect for all cases.)

Note that if a date falls in the last week of the previous year, MySQL will
return <CODE>0</CODE> if you don't use <CODE>2</CODE> or <CODE>3</CODE> as the optional
<CODE>start</CODE> argument:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEAR('2000-01-01'), WEEK('2000-01-01',0);
        -&#62; 2000, 0
</PRE>

One might argue that MySQL should return <CODE>52</CODE> for the <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>
function, because the given date actually occurs in the 52nd week of 1999.  We
decided to return <CODE>0</CODE> instead as we want the function to return ``the week
number in the given year.''  This makes the usage of the <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>
function reliable when combined with other functions that extract a
date part from a date.

If you would prefer the result to be evaluated with respect to the year
that contains the first day of the week for the given date, you should use
<CODE>2</CODE> or <CODE>3</CODE> as the optional <CODE>start</CODE> argument.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('2000-01-01',2);
        -&#62; 52
</PRE>

Alternatively, use the <CODE>YEARWEEK()</CODE> function:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEARWEEK('2000-01-01');
        -&#62; 199952
mysql&#62; SELECT MID(YEARWEEK('2000-01-01'),5,2);
        -&#62; '52'
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1333"></A>
<DT><CODE>WEEKOFYEAR(date)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the calendar week of the date as a number in the

        -&#62; 8
</PRE>

<CODE>WEEKOFYEAR()</CODE> is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

<A NAME="IDX1334"></A>
<DT><CODE>YEAR(date)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the year for <CODE>date</CODE>, in the range <CODE>1000</CODE> to <CODE>9999</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEAR('98-02-03');
        -&#62; 1998
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>YEARWEEK(date)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>YEARWEEK(date,start)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns year and week for a date.  The <CODE>start</CODE> argument works exactly
like the <CODE>start</CODE> argument to <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>.  Note that the year in the
result may be
different from the year in the date argument for the first and the last
week of the year:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEARWEEK('1987-01-01');
        -&#62; 198653
</PRE>

Note that the week number is different from what the <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>
function would return (<CODE>0</CODE>) for optional arguments <CODE>0</CODE> or <CODE>1</CODE>,
as <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> then returns the week in the context of the given year.

<A NAME="IDX1335"></A>
<DT><CODE>HOUR(time)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the hour for <CODE>time</CODE>. The range of the return value will be
<CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>23</CODE> for time-of-day values:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT HOUR('10:05:03');
        -&#62; 10
</PRE>

However, the range of <CODE>TIME</CODE> values actually is much larger, so
<CODE>HOUR</CODE> can return values greater than <CODE>23</CODE>:

<A NAME="IDX1339"></A>
<DT><CODE>PERIOD_ADD(P,N)</CODE>
<DD>
Adds <CODE>N</CODE> months to period <CODE>P</CODE> (in the format <CODE>YYMM</CODE> or

Note that the period argument <CODE>P</CODE> is <STRONG>not</STRONG> a date value:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT PERIOD_ADD(9801,2);
        -&#62; 199803
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1340"></A>
<DT><CODE>PERIOD_DIFF(P1,P2)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number of months between periods <CODE>P1</CODE> and <CODE>P2</CODE>.
<CODE>P1</CODE> and <CODE>P2</CODE> should be in the format <CODE>YYMM</CODE> or <CODE>YYYYMM</CODE>.

Note that the period arguments <CODE>P1</CODE> and <CODE>P2</CODE> are <STRONG>not</STRONG>
date values:

These functions perform date arithmetic.

As of MySQL Version 3.23, <CODE>INTERVAL expr type</CODE> is allowed on either
side of the <CODE>+</CODE> operator if the expression on the other side is a
date or datetime value.
For the <CODE>-</CODE> operator, <CODE>INTERVAL expr type</CODE> is allowed only on
the right side, because
it makes no sense to subtract a date or datetime value from an interval.
(See examples below.)

<CODE>date</CODE> is a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>DATE</CODE> value specifying the starting
date.  <CODE>expr</CODE> is an expression specifying the interval value to be added
or subtracted from the starting date.  <CODE>expr</CODE> is a string; it may start
with a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> for negative intervals.  <CODE>type</CODE> is a keyword indicating
how the expression should be interpreted.

The following table shows how the <CODE>type</CODE> and <CODE>expr</CODE> arguments
are related:

MySQL allows any punctuation delimiter in the <CODE>expr</CODE> format.

<CODE>YEAR</CODE>, <CODE>MONTH</CODE>, and <CODE>DAY</CODE> parts (that is, no time parts), the
result is a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value.  Otherwise, the result is a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>

</PRE>

If you specify an interval value that is too short (does not include all the
interval parts that would be expected from the <CODE>type</CODE> keyword),
MySQL assumes you have left out the leftmost parts of the interval
value.  For example, if you specify a <CODE>type</CODE> of <CODE>DAY_SECOND</CODE>, the
value of <CODE>expr</CODE> is expected to have days, hours, minutes, and seconds
parts.  If you specify a value like <CODE>'1:10'</CODE>, MySQL assumes
that the days and hours parts are missing and the value represents minutes
and seconds.  In other words, <CODE>'1:10' DAY_SECOND</CODE> is interpreted in such
a way that it is equivalent to <CODE>'1:10' MINUTE_SECOND</CODE>.  This is
analogous to the way that MySQL interprets <CODE>TIME</CODE> values
as representing elapsed time rather than as time of day.

Note that if you add to or subtract from a date value something that
contains a time part, the result is automatically converted to a
datetime value:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD('1999-01-01', INTERVAL 1 DAY);
        -&#62; '1999-01-02'
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD('1999-01-01', INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
        -&#62; '1999-01-01 01:00:00'
</PRE>

If you use really malformed dates, the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If you add
<CODE>MONTH</CODE>, <CODE>YEAR_MONTH</CODE>, or <CODE>YEAR</CODE> and the resulting date
has a day that is larger than the maximum day for the new month, the day is
adjusted to the maximum days in the new month:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD('1998-01-30', interval 1 month);
        -&#62; '1998-02-28'
</PRE>

Note from the preceding example that the keyword <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> and the
<CODE>type</CODE> specifier are not case-sensitive.

When invoked with the <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> form of the second argument,

<DT><CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date)</CODE>
<DD>
If called with no argument, returns a Unix timestamp (seconds since
<CODE>'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> GMT) as an unsigned integer. If
<CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> is called with a <CODE>date</CODE> argument, it
returns the value of the argument as seconds since <CODE>'1970-01-01
00:00:00'</CODE> GMT.  <CODE>date</CODE> may be a <CODE>DATE</CODE> string, a
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> string, a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, or a number in the format
<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> in local time:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP();

mysql&#62; SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('1997-10-04 22:23:00');
        -&#62; 875996580
</PRE>

When <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP</CODE> is used on a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column, the function
returns the internal timestamp value directly, with no implicit
``string-to-Unix-timestamp'' conversion.
If you pass an out-of-range date to <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> it
returns <CODE>0</CODE>, but please note that only basic checking is performed
(year 1970-2037, month 01-12, day 01-31).

If you want to subtract <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> columns, you may want to
cast the result to signed integers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Cast_Functions" HREF="manual_toc.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>CAST()</CODE> and <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> functions may be used to take a
value of one type and produce a value of another type.  Their syntax is:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1372"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1373"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
CAST(expression AS type)
CONVERT(expression,type)
CONVERT(expr USING transcoding_name)
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>type</CODE> value can be one of the following:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>BINARY</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>CHAR</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>DATE</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>SIGNED {INTEGER}</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>TIME</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>UNSIGNED {INTEGER}</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>CAST()</CODE> and <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> are available as of MySQL 4.0.2.
The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> conversion type is available as of 4.0.6.
The <CODE>USING</CODE> form of <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> is available as of 4.1.0.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CAST()</CODE> and <CODE>CONVERT(... USING ...)</CODE> are SQL-99 syntax.
The non-<CODE>USING</CODE> form of <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> is ODBC syntax.

</P>
<P>
The cast functions are useful when you want to create a column with
a specific type in a <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT CAST('2000-01-01' AS DATE);
</PRE>

<P>
The functions also can be useful for sorting <CODE>ENUM</CODE> columns in lexical
order. Normally sorting of <CODE>ENUM</CODE> columns occurs using the internal
numeric values. Casting the values to <CODE>CHAR</CODE> results in a lexical
sort:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT enum_col FROM tbl_name ORDER BY CAST(enum_col AS CHAR);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>CAST(string AS BINARY)</CODE> is the same thing as <CODE>BINARY string</CODE>.
<CODE>CAST(expr AS CHAR)</CODE> treats the expression as a string with the
default character set.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: In MysQL 4.0 the <CODE>CAST()</CODE> to <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, or <CODE>TIME</CODE> only marks the column to be a specific
type but doesn't change the value of the column.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.1.0 the value is converted to the correct column type when
it's sent to the user (this is a feature of how the new protocol in 4.1
sends date information to the client):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(NOW() AS DATE);
       -&#62; 2003-05-26
</PRE>

<P>
In later MySQL versions (probably 4.1.2 or 5.0) we will fix that <CODE>CAST</CODE>
also changes the result if you use it as part of a more complex expression,
like <CODE>CONCAT("Date: ",CAST(NOW() AS DATE))</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should not use <CODE>CAST()</CODE> to extract data in different formats but
instead use string functions like <CODE>LEFT</CODE> or
<CODE>EXTRACT()</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_functions">6.3.4  Date and Time Functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
To cast a string to a numeric value, you don't normally have to do
anything; just use the string value as it would be a number:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+'1';
       -&#62; 2
</PRE>

<P>
If you use a number in string context, the number will automatically be
converted to a <CODE>BINARY</CODE> string.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT("hello you ",2);
       -&#62;  "hello you 2"
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL supports arithmetic with both signed and unsigned 64-bit values.
If you are using numerical operations (like <CODE>+</CODE>) and one of the
operands is <CODE>unsigned integer</CODE>, the result will be unsigned.
You can override this by using the <CODE>SIGNED</CODE> and <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>
cast operators to cast the operation to a signed or
unsigned 64-bit integer, respectively.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(1-2 AS UNSIGNED)
        -&#62; 18446744073709551615
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(CAST(1-2 AS UNSIGNED) AS SIGNED);
        -&#62; -1
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if either operand is a floating-point value, the result is
a floating-point value and is not affected by the above rule.
(In this context, <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> values are regarded as floating-point values.)

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) - 2.0;
        -&#62; -1.0
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using a string in an arithmetic operation, this is converted
to a floating-point number.

</P>
<P>
The handing of unsigned values was changed in MySQL 4.0 to be able to
support <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> values properly. If you have some code that you
want to run in both MySQL 4.0 and 3.23 (in which case you probably can't
use the <CODE>CAST()</CODE> function), you can use the following technique to get
a signed result when subtracting two unsigned integer columns:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT (unsigned_column_1+0.0)-(unsigned_column_2+0.0);
</PRE>

<P>
The idea is that the columns are converted to floating-point values before
the subtraction occurs.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> columns in your old MySQL
application when porting to MySQL 4.0, you can use the
<CODE>--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> option when starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  Note however that as long as you use this, you will not
be able to make efficient use of the <CODE>BIGINT UNSIGNED</CODE> column type.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> with <CODE>USING</CODE> is used to convert data between different
character sets.  In MySQL, transcoding names are the same as the
corresponding character set names.  For example, this statement converts
the string <CODE>'abc'</CODE> in the server's default character set to the
corresponding string in the <CODE>utf8</CODE> character set:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CONVERT('abc' USING utf8);

Returns the current MySQL username and hostname:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER();
        -&#62; 'davida@localhost'
</PRE>

The value indicates the username you specified when connecting to
the server, and the client host from which you connected.  (Prior
to MySQL Version 3.22.11, the function value does not include the
client hostname.)

You can extract just the username part, regardless of whether the
value includes a hostname part, like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),"@",1);
        -&#62; 'davida'
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1393"></A>
<DT><CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE>

mysql&#62; SELECT CURRENT_USER();

The example illustrates that although the client specified a username of
<CODE>davida</CODE> (as indicated by the value of the <CODE>USER()</CODE> function),
the server authenticated the client using an anonymous user account (as seen by
the empty username part of the <CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE> value). One way this might

<A NAME="IDX1396"></A>
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> encryption is non-reversible.

<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> does not perform password encryption in the same way that
Unix passwords are encrypted. See <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE>.

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG>
The <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function is used by the authentication system in
MySQL Server, you should <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> use it in your own applications.
For that purpose, use <CODE>MD5()</CODE> or <CODE>SHA1()</CODE> instead.
Also see <CODE>RFC-2195</CODE> for more information about handling passwords
and authentication securely in your application.

<A NAME="IDX1397"></A>
<DT><CODE>ENCRYPT(str[,salt])</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt <CODE>str</CODE> using the Unix <CODE>crypt()</CODE> system call. The
<CODE>salt</CODE> argument should be a string with two characters.
(As of MySQL Version 3.22.16, <CODE>salt</CODE> may be longer than two characters.)


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ENCRYPT("hello");
        -&#62; 'VxuFAJXVARROc'
</PRE>

<CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> ignores all but the first 8 characters of <CODE>str</CODE>, at
least on some systems.  This behaviour is determined by the implementation
of the underlying <CODE>crypt()</CODE> system call.

If <CODE>crypt()</CODE> is not available on your system, <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> always
returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  Because of this we recommend that you use <CODE>MD5()</CODE>
or <CODE>SHA1()</CODE> instead; these two functions exist on all platforms.

<A NAME="IDX1398"></A>
<DT><CODE>ENCODE(str,pass_str)</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt <CODE>str</CODE> using <CODE>pass_str</CODE> as the password.
To decrypt the result, use <CODE>DECODE()</CODE>.

The results is a binary string of the same length as <CODE>string</CODE>.
If you want to save it in a column, use a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column type.

<A NAME="IDX1399"></A>
<DT><CODE>DECODE(crypt_str,pass_str)</CODE>
<DD>
Descrypts the encrypted string <CODE>crypt_str</CODE> using <CODE>pass_str</CODE> as the

<CODE>ENCODE()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1400"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD5(string)</CODE>
<DD>
Calculates an MD5 128-bit checksum for the string. The value is returned
as a 32-digit hex number that may, for example, be used as a hash key:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT MD5("testing");
        -&#62; 'ae2b1fca515949e5d54fb22b8ed95575'
</PRE>

This is the "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm".

<A NAME="IDX1401"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1402"></A>
<DT><CODE>SHA1(string)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>SHA(string)</CODE>
<DD>
Calculates an SHA1 160-bit checksum for the string, as described in
RFC 3174 (Secure Hash Algorithm). The value is returned as a 40-digit
hex number, or <CODE>NULL</CODE> in case the input argument was <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
One of the possible uses for this function is as a hash key. You can
also use it as cryptographically safe function for storing passwords.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SHA1("abc");
        -&#62; 'a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d'
</PRE>

<CODE>SHA1()</CODE> was added in version 4.0.2, and can be considered
a cryptographically more secure equivalent of <CODE>MD5()</CODE>.
<CODE>SHA()</CODE> is synonym for <CODE>SHA1()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1404"></A>
<DT><CODE>AES_ENCRYPT(string,key_string)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>AES_DECRYPT(string,key_string)</CODE>
<DD>
These functions allow encryption/decryption of data using the official
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, previously known as Rijndael.
Encoding with a 128-bit key length is used, but you can extend it up to
256 bits by modifying the source. We chose 128 bits because it is much
faster and it is usually secure enough.

The input arguments may be any length. If either argument is <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
the result of this function is also <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

As AES is a block-level algorithm, padding is used to encode uneven length
strings and so the result string length may be calculated as
16*(trunc(string_length/16)+1).

If <CODE>AES_DECRYPT()</CODE> detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it
returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>. However, it is possible for <CODE>AES_DECRYPT()</CODE>
to return a non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value (possibly garbage) if the input data or
the key are invalid.

You can use the AES functions to store data in an encrypted form by
modifying your queries:

<PRE>
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT("text","password"));
</PRE>

You can get even more security by not transferring the key over the
connection for each query, which can be accomplished by storing it in a
server side variable at connection time:

<PRE>
SELECT @password:="my password";
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT("text",@password));
</PRE>

<CODE>AES_ENCRYPT()</CODE> and <CODE>AES_DECRYPT()</CODE> were added in version 4.0.2,
and can be considered the most cryptographically secure encryption
functions currently available in MySQL.

<A NAME="IDX1405"></A>
<DT><CODE>DES_ENCRYPT(string_to_encrypt [, (key_number | key_string) ] )</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypts the string with the given key using the Triple-DES algorithm.

Note that this function only works if you have configured MySQL with
SSL support. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.10  Using Secure Connections</A>.

The encryption key to use is chosen the following way:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Argument</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Only one argument </TD><TD>
The first key from <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> is used.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>key number </TD><TD>
The given key (0-9) from the <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> is used.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>string </TD><TD>
The given <CODE>key_string</CODE> will be used to crypt <CODE>string_to_encrypt</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

The return string will be a binary string where the first character
will be <CODE>CHAR(128 | key_number)</CODE>.

The 128 is added to make it easier to recognise an encrypted key.
If you use a string key, <CODE>key_number</CODE> will be 127.

On error, this function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

The string length for the result will be
<CODE>new_length= org_length + (8-(org_length % 8))+1</CODE>.

The <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> has the following format:


<PRE>
key_number des_key_string
key_number des_key_string
</PRE>

Each <CODE>key_number</CODE> must be a number in the range from 0 to 9.  Lines in
the file may be in any order.  <CODE>des_key_string</CODE> is the string that
will be used to encrypt the message.  Between the number and the key there
should be at least one space.  The first key is the default key that will
be used if you don't specify any key argument to <CODE>DES_ENCRYPT()</CODE>

You can tell MySQL to read new key values from the key file with the
<CODE>FLUSH DES_KEY_FILE</CODE> command.  This requires the <CODE>Reload_priv</CODE>
privilege.

One benefit of having a set of default keys is that it gives applications
a way to check for the existence of encrypted column values, without giving
the end user the right to decrypt those values.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT customer_address FROM customer_table WHERE
       crypted_credit_card = DES_ENCRYPT("credit_card_number");
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1406"></A>
<DT><CODE>DES_DECRYPT(string_to_decrypt [, key_string])</CODE>
<DD>
Decrypts a string encrypted with <CODE>DES_ENCRYPT()</CODE>.

Note that this function only works if you have configured MySQL with
SSL support. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.10  Using Secure Connections</A>.

If no <CODE>key_string</CODE> argument is given, <CODE>DES_DECRYPT()</CODE> examines
the first byte of the encrypted string to determine the DES key number
that was used to encrypt the original string, then reads the key
from the <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> to decrypt the message.  For this to work
the user must have the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.

If you pass this function a <CODE>key_string</CODE> argument, that string
is used as the key for decrypting the message.

If the <CODE>string_to_decrypt</CODE> doesn't look like an encrypted string, MySQL
will return the given <CODE>string_to_decrypt</CODE>.

On error, this function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1407"></A>
<DT><CODE>COMPRESS(string_to_compress)</CODE>
<DD>
Compresses a string.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS(REPEAT("a",1000)));
        -&#62; 21
mysql&#62; SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS(""));
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS("a"));
        -&#62; 13
mysql&#62; SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS(REPEAT("a",16)));
        -&#62; 15
</PRE>

<CODE>COMPRESS()</CODE> was added in MySQL version 4.1.1.
If requires MySQL to have been compiled with a compression library such as
<CODE>zlib</CODE>. Otherwise, the return value is always <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1408"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNCOMPRESS(string_to_uncompress)</CODE>
<DD>
Uncompresses a string compressed by the <CODE>COMPRESS()</CODE> function.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT UNCOMPRESS(COMPRESS("any string"));
        -&#62; 'any string'
</PRE>

<CODE>UNCOMPRESS()</CODE> was added in MySQL version 4.1.1.
If requires MySQL to have been compiled with a compression library such as
<CODE>zlib</CODE>. Otherwise, the return value is always <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1409"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH(compressed_string)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the length of a compressed string before compressing.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH(COMPRESS(REPEAT("a",30)));
        -&#62; 30
</PRE>

<CODE>UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH()</CODE> was added in MySQL version 4.1.1.

<A NAME="IDX1410"></A>
<DT><CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID([expr])</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
        -&#62; 195
</PRE>

The last ID that was generated is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis. This means the value the function returns to a given
client is the most recent <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value generated by that
client. The value cannot be affected by other clients, even if they generate
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> values of their own. This behaviour ensures that you can
retrieve your own ID without concern for the activity of other clients, and
without the need for locks or transactions.

The value of <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> is not changed if you
update the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column of a row with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not <CODE>0</CODE>).

If you insert many rows at the same time with an insert statement,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> returns the value for the first inserted row.
The reason for this is to make it possible to easily reproduce
the same <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement against some other server.

<A NAME="IDX1411"></A>
If <CODE>expr</CODE> is given as an argument to <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, then
the value of the argument is returned by the function, and is set as the
next value to be returned by <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.  This can be used
to simulate sequences:

First create the table:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE sequence (id INT NOT NULL);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO sequence VALUES (0);
</PRE>

Then the table can be used to generate sequence numbers like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE sequence SET id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id+1);
</PRE>

You can generate sequences without calling <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, but the
utility of using the function this way is that the ID value is maintained in
the server as the last automatically generated value (multi-user safe).
You can retrieve the new ID as you would read any normal
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value in MySQL. For example, <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>
(without an argument) will return the new ID.  The C API function
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> can also be used to get the value.

Note that as <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> is only updated after <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements, so you can't use the C API function to
retrieve the value for <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)</CODE> after executing other
SQL statements like <CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>SET</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">11.1.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<A NAME="IDX1412"></A>
<DT><CODE>FORMAT(X,D)</CODE>
<DD>
Formats the number <CODE>X</CODE> to a format like <CODE>'#,###,###.##'</CODE>, rounded
to <CODE>D</CODE> decimals, and returns the result as a string.
If <CODE>D</CODE> is <CODE>0</CODE>, the result will have no
decimal point or fractional part:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT FORMAT(12332.123456, 4);
        -&#62; '12,332.1235'
mysql&#62; SELECT FORMAT(12332.1,4);
        -&#62; '12,332.1000'
mysql&#62; SELECT FORMAT(12332.2,0);
        -&#62; '12,332'
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1413"></A>
<DT><CODE>VERSION()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a string indicating the MySQL server version:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION();
        -&#62; '3.23.13-log'
</PRE>

Note that if your version ends with <CODE>-log</CODE> this means that logging is
enabled.

<A NAME="IDX1414"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONNECTION_ID()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the connection ID (thread ID) for the connection.
Every connection has its own unique ID:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONNECTION_ID();
        -&#62; 23786
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1415"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1416"></A>
<DT><CODE>GET_LOCK(str,timeout)</CODE>
<DD>
Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string <CODE>str</CODE>, with a
timeout of <CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds.  Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock was obtained
successfully, <CODE>0</CODE> if the attempt timed out (for example, because another
client has already locked the name), or <CODE>NULL</CODE> if an error
occurred (such as running out of memory or the thread was killed with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE>).  A lock is released when you execute
<CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>, execute a new <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>, or the thread
terminates (either normally or abnormally).

This function can be used to implement application locks or to
simulate record locks.  Names are locked on a server-wide basis.
If a name has been locked by one client, <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> blocks
any request by another client for a lock with the same name. This
allows clients that agree on a given lock name to use the name to
perform cooperative advisory locking:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT GET_LOCK("lock1",10);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT IS_FREE_LOCK("lock2");
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT GET_LOCK("lock2",10);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT RELEASE_LOCK("lock2");
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT RELEASE_LOCK("lock1");
        -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

Note that the second <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE> call returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> because
the lock <CODE>"lock1"</CODE> was automatically released by the second
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> call.

<A NAME="IDX1417"></A>
<DT><CODE>RELEASE_LOCK(str)</CODE>
<DD>
Releases the lock named by the string <CODE>str</CODE> that was obtained with
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>. Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock was released, <CODE>0</CODE> if the
lock wasn't locked by this thread (in which case the lock is not released),
and <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the named lock didn't exist.  (The lock will not exist if
it was never obtained by a call to <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> or if it already has
been released.)

The <CODE>DO</CODE> statement is convinient to use with <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#DO">6.4.9  <CODE>DO</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1418"></A>
<DT><CODE>IS_FREE_LOCK(str)</CODE>
<DD>
Checks if the lock named <CODE>str</CODE> is free to use (that is, not locked).
Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock is free (no one is using the lock),
<CODE>0</CODE> if the lock is in use, and
<CODE>NULL</CODE> on errors (such as incorrect arguments).

<A NAME="IDX1419"></A>
<DT><CODE>BENCHMARK(count,expr)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>BENCHMARK()</CODE> function executes the expression <CODE>expr</CODE>
repeatedly <CODE>count</CODE> times.  It may be used to time how fast MySQL
processes the expression.  The result value is always <CODE>0</CODE>.  The intended
use is in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, which reports query execution times:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,ENCODE("hello","goodbye"));
+----------------------------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,ENCODE("hello","goodbye")) |
+----------------------------------------------+
|                                            0 |
+----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (4.74 sec)
</PRE>

The time reported is elapsed time on the client end, not CPU time on the
server end.  It may be advisable to execute <CODE>BENCHMARK()</CODE> several
times, and interpret the result with regard to how heavily loaded the
server machine is.

<A NAME="IDX1420"></A>
<DT><CODE>INET_NTOA(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Given a numeric network address (4 or 8 byte), returns the dotted-quad
representation of the address as a string:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT INET_NTOA(3520061480);
       -&#62;  "209.207.224.40"
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1421"></A>
<DT><CODE>INET_ATON(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Given the dotted-quad representation of a network address as a string,
returns an integer that represents the numeric value of the address.
Addresses may be 4 or 8 byte addresses:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT INET_ATON("209.207.224.40");
       -&#62;  3520061480
</PRE>

The generated number is always in network byte order; for example the
above number is calculated as <CODE>209*256^3 + 207*256^2 + 224*256 +40</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1422"></A>
<DT><CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name, log_pos [, timeout])</CODE>
<DD>
Blocks until the slave reaches (that is, has read and applied all updates up
to) the specified position in the master log. If master information is
not initialised, or if the arguments are incorrect, returns
<CODE>NULL</CODE>. If the slave is not running, will block and wait until it
is started and goes to or past the specified position. If the slave is
already past the specified position, returns immediately.

If <CODE>timeout</CODE> (new in 4.0.10) is specified, will give up waiting
when <CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds have elapsed. <CODE>timeout</CODE> must be greater
than 0; a zero or negative <CODE>timeout</CODE> means no timeout.  The return
value is the number of log events it had to wait to get to the specified
position, or <CODE>NULL</CODE> in case of error, or <CODE>-1</CODE> if the timeout
has been exceeded.

This command is useful for control of master/slave synchronisation.

<A NAME="IDX1423"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1424"></A>
<DT><CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE>
<DD>
A <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement may include a <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause to restrict the
number of rows the server returns to the client.
In some cases, it is desirable to know how many rows the statement would have
returned without the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, but without running the statement again.
To get this row count, include a <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> option in the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, then invoke <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> afterward:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM tbl_name
       WHERE id &#62; 100 LIMIT 10;
mysql&#62; SELECT FOUND_ROWS();
</PRE>

The second <CODE>SELECT</CODE> will return a number indicating how many rows the
first <CODE>SELECT</CODE> would have returned had it been written without the
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause.
(If the preceding <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement does not include the
<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> option, then <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> may return
a different result when <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> is used than when it is not.)

Note that if you are using <CODE>SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ...</CODE> MySQL has
to calculate how many rows are in the full result set.  However, this is
faster than running the query again without <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, because the result
set need not be sent to the client.

<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> and <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> can be useful in situations
when you want to restrict the number of rows that a query returns, but also
determine the number of rows in the full result set without running the query
again. An example is a web script that presents a paged display containing
links to the pages that show other sections of a search result. Using
<CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> allows you to determine how many other pages are needed
for the rest of the result.

The use of <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> and <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> is more complex
for <CODE>UNION</CODE> queries than for simple <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, because
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> may occur at multiple places in a <CODE>UNION</CODE>. It may be applied
to individual <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements in the <CODE>UNION</CODE>, or global to the
<CODE>UNION</CODE> result as a whole.

The intent of <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> for <CODE>UNION</CODE> is that it should
return the row count that would be returned without a global <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>.
The conditions for use of <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> with <CODE>UNION</CODE> are:


<UL>

<LI>

The <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> keyword must appear in the first <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
of the <CODE>UNION</CODE>.

<LI>

The value of <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> is exact only if <CODE>UNION ALL</CODE> is used.
If <CODE>UNION</CODE> without <CODE>ALL</CODE> is used, duplicate removal occurs and the
value of <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> is only approximate.

<LI>

If no <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> is present in the <CODE>UNION</CODE>, <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE>
is ignored and returns the number of rows in the temporary table that is
created to process the <CODE>UNION</CODE>.

</UL>

<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> and <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> are available starting at MySQL version 4.0.0.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>COUNT(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1427"></A>
 
Returns a count of the number of non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values in the rows
retrieved by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student.student_name,COUNT(*)
    -&#62;        FROM student,course
    -&#62;        WHERE student.student_id=course.student_id
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;

</PRE>

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is somewhat different in that it returns a count of
the number of rows retrieved, whether or not they contain <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values.

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is optimised to
return very quickly if the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves from one table, no
other columns are retrieved, and there is no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student;
</PRE>

This optimisation applies only to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables
only, because an exact record count is stored for these table types and
can be accessed very quickly. For transactional storage engines
(<CODE>InnodB</CODE>, <CODE>BDB</CODE>), storing an exact row count is more problematic
because multiple transactions may be occurring, each of which may affect the
count.

<A NAME="IDX1428"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1429"></A>
<DT><CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT expr,[expr...])</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a count of the number of different non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT results) FROM student;
</PRE>

In MySQL you can get the number of distinct expression
combinations that don't contain NULL by giving a list of expressions.
In SQL-99 you would have to do a concatenation of all expressions
inside <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1430"></A>
<DT><CODE>AVG(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the average value of <CODE>expr</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student_name, AVG(test_score)
    -&#62;        FROM student
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1431"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1432"></A>
<DT><CODE>MIN(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>MAX(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the minimum or maximum value of <CODE>expr</CODE>.  <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX()</CODE> may take a string argument; in such cases they return the
minimum or maximum string value. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student_name, MIN(test_score), MAX(test_score)
    -&#62;        FROM student
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

In <CODE>MIN()</CODE>, <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and other aggregate functions, MySQL
currently compares <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns by their string
value rather than by the string's relative position in the set.
This will be rectified.

<A NAME="IDX1433"></A>
<DT><CODE>SUM(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the sum of <CODE>expr</CODE>.  Note that if the return set has no rows,
it returns NULL!

<A NAME="IDX1434"></A>
<DT><CODE>GROUP_CONCAT(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Full syntax:

<PRE>
GROUP_CONCAT([DISTINCT] expr [,expr ...]
             [ORDER BY {unsigned_integer | col_name | formula} [ASC | DESC] [,col ...]]
             [SEPARATOR str_val])
</PRE>

This function was added in MySQL version 4.1.
It returns a string result with the concatenated values from a group:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student_name,
    -&#62;        GROUP_CONCAT(test_score)
    -&#62;        FROM student 
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;
or
mysql&#62; SELECT student_name,
    -&#62;        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT test_score
    -&#62;                     ORDER BY test_score DESC SEPARATOR " ")
    -&#62;        FROM student
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

In MySQL you can get the concatenated values of expression combinations.
You can eliminate duplicate values by using <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>.
If you want to sort values in the result you should use <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
clause.
To sort in reverse order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> (descending) keyword to the
name of the column you are sorting by in the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause. The
default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using the
<CODE>ASC</CODE> keyword.
<CODE>SEPARATOR</CODE> is the string value which should be inserted between
values of result. The default is a comma (<SAMP>`","'</SAMP>). You can remove
the separator altogether by specifying <CODE>SEPARATOR ""</CODE>.

You can set a maximum allowed length with the variable
<CODE>group_concat_max_len</CODE> in your configuration.
The syntax to do this at runtime is:

<PRE>
SET [SESSION | GLOBAL] group_concat_max_len = unsigned_integer;
</PRE>

If a maximum length has been set, the result is truncated to this
maximum length. 

The <CODE>GROUP_CONCAT()</CODE> function is an enhanced implementation of
the basic <CODE>LIST()</CODE> function supported by Sybase SQL Anywhere.
<CODE>GROUP_CONCAT()</CODE> is backward compatible with the extremely limited
functionality of <CODE>LIST()</CODE>, if only one column and no other options
are specified. <CODE>LIST()</CODE> does have a default sorting order.

<A NAME="IDX1435"></A>
<DT><CODE>VARIANCE(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the standard variance of <CODE>expr</CODE> (considering rows as the
whole population, not as a sample; so it has the number of rows as
denominator). This is an extension to 
SQL-99 (available only in version 4.1 or later).

<A NAME="IDX1436"></A>

<DD>
Returns the standard deviation of <CODE>expr</CODE> (the square root of
<CODE>VARIANCE()</CODE>. This is an extension to SQL-99. The <CODE>STDDEV()</CODE>
form of this function is provided for Oracle compatibility.

<A NAME="IDX1440"></A>

<H4><A NAME="GROUP-BY-Modifiers" HREF="manual_toc.html#GROUP-BY-Modifiers">6.3.7.2  <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Modifiers</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1443"></A>

</P>

<P>
As of MySQL 4.1.1, the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause allows a <CODE>WITH
ROLLUP</CODE> modifier that causes extra rows to be added to the summary
output. These rows represent higher-level (or super-aggregate) summary
operations. <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> thus allows you to answer questions at multiple
levels of analysis with a single query. It can be used, for example,
to provide support for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations.

</P>
<P>
As an illustration, suppose that a table named <CODE>sales</CODE> has <CODE>year</CODE>,
<CODE>country</CODE>,
<CODE>product</CODE>, and <CODE>profit</CODE> columns for recording sales profitability:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE sales
(
    year    INT NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    product VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    profit  INT
);
</PRE>

<P>
The table's contents can be summarized per year with a simple <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT year, SUM(profit) FROM sales GROUP BY year;
+------+-------------+
| year | SUM(profit) |
+------+-------------+
| 2000 |        4525 |
| 2001 |        3010 |
+------+-------------+
</PRE>

<P>
This output shows the total profit for each year, but if you also want
to determine the total profit summed over all years, you must add up
the individual values yourself or run an additional query.

</P>
<P>
Or you can use <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>, which provides both levels of analysis with a
single query.
Adding a <CODE>WITH ROLLUP</CODE> modifier to the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause causes the query
to produce another row that shows the grand total over all year values:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT year, SUM(profit) FROM sales GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP;
+------+-------------+
| year | SUM(profit) |
+------+-------------+
| 2000 |        4525 |
| 2001 |        3010 |
| NULL |        7535 |
+------+-------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The grand total super-aggregate line is identified by the value <CODE>NULL</CODE> in
the <CODE>year</CODE> column.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> has a more complex effect when there are multiple <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
columns. In this case, each time there is a ``break'' (change in value)
in any but the last grouping column, the query produces an extra
super-aggregate summary row.

</P>
<P>
For example, without <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>, a summary on the <CODE>sales</CODE> table based
on <CODE>year</CODE>,
<CODE>country</CODE>, and <CODE>product</CODE> might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit)
    -&#62; FROM sales
    -&#62; GROUP BY year, country, product;
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | SUM(profit) |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |         100 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |         150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |        1200 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |          75 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |          10 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |          50 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |        2700 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |         250 |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The output indicates summary values only at the year/country/product level of
analysis.  When <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> is added, the query produces several extra rows:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit)
    -&#62; FROM sales
    -&#62; GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | SUM(profit) |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |        1500 |

</PRE>

<P>
For this query, adding <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> causes the output to include summary
information at four levels of analysis, not just one.  Here's how to
interpret the <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> output:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Following each set of product rows for a given year and country, an
extra summary row is produced showing the total for all products. These rows
have the <CODE>product</CODE> column set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

Following each set of rows for a given year, an extra summary row is
produced showing the total for all countries and products. These rows
have the <CODE>country</CODE> and <CODE>products</CODE> columns set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

Finally, following all other rows, an extra summary row is produced
showing the grand total for all years, countries, and products. This
row has the <CODE>year</CODE>, <CODE>country</CODE>, and <CODE>products</CODE> columns set to
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Other Considerations When using <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE></STRONG>

</P>
<P>
The following items list some behaviours specific to the MySQL implementation
of <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>:

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>, you cannot also use an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause to
sort the results. (In other words, <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> are mutually
exclusive.) However, you still have some control over sort order.
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
in MySQL sorts results, and you can use explicit <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE> keywords
with columns named in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> list to specify sort order for
individual columns.  (The higher-level summary rows added by <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>
still appear after the rows from which they are calculated, regardless
of the sort order.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> can be used to restrict the number of rows returned to the
client. <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> is applied after <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>, so the limit applies
against the extra rows added by <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>. For example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit)
    -&#62; FROM sales
    -&#62; GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP
    -&#62; LIMIT 5;
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | SUM(profit) |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |         100 |
| 2000 | Finland | NULL       |        1600 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |         150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |        1200 |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that using <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> with <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> may produce results
that are more difficult to interpret, because you have less context
for understanding the super-aggregate rows.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NULL</CODE> indicators in each super-aggregate row are produced when the
row is sent to the client.  The server looks at the columns named in
the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause following the leftmost one that has changed value.
For any column in the result set with a name that is a lexical match to
any of those names, its value is set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  (If you specify grouping
columns by column number, the server identifies which columns to set to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> by number.)

</P>
<P>
Because the <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in the super-aggregate rows are placed into the
result set at such a late stage in query processing, you cannot test them
as <CODE>NULL</CODE> values within the query itself.  For example, you cannot add
<CODE>HAVING product IS NULL</CODE> to the query to eliminate from the output all
but the super-aggregate rows.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> values do appear as <CODE>NULL</CODE>
on the client side and can be tested as such using any MySQL client
programming interface.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="GROUP-BY-hidden-fields" HREF="manual_toc.html#GROUP-BY-hidden-fields">6.3.7.3  <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with Hidden Fields</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1444"></A>
MySQL has extended the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>. You can use columns or
calculations in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expressions that don't appear in
the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part. This stands for <EM>any possible value for this
group</EM>.  You can use this to get better performance by avoiding sorting and
grouping on unnecessary items.  For example, you don't need to group on
<CODE>customer.name</CODE> in the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT order.custid,customer.name,MAX(payments)
    -&#62;        FROM order,customer
    -&#62;        WHERE order.custid = customer.custid
    -&#62;        GROUP BY order.custid;
</PRE>

<P>
In standard SQL, you would have to add <CODE>customer.name</CODE> to the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause.  In MySQL, the name is redundant if you don't run in
ANSI mode.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Don't use this feature</STRONG> if the columns you omit from the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part aren't unique in the group!  You will get
unpredictable results.

</P>
<P>
In some cases, you can use <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> to obtain a specific
column value even if it isn't unique. The following gives the value of
<CODE>column</CODE> from the row containing the smallest value in the <CODE>sort</CODE>
column:

</P>

<PRE>
SUBSTR(MIN(CONCAT(RPAD(sort,6,' '),column)),7)

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22 (or earlier) or if
you are trying to follow SQL-99, you can't use expressions in <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses.  You can work around this limitation by
using an alias for the expression:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) AS val FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        GROUP BY id,val ORDER BY val;

<P>
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables.
Each <CODE>select_expression</CODE> indicates a column you want to retrieve.
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> may also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.  
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 + 1;
         -&#62; 2
</PRE>

<P>
All clauses used must be given in exactly the order shown in the syntax
description. For example,
a <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause must come after any <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause and before
any <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1452"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1453"></A>
A <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expression may be given an alias using <CODE>AS alias_name</CODE>.
The alias is used as the expression's column name and can be used with
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clauses.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
    FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
</PRE>

The <CODE>AS</CODE> keyword is optional when aliasing a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expression.
The preceding example could have been written like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) full_name
    FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
</PRE>

Because the <CODE>AS</CODE> is optional, a subtle problem can occur
if you forget the comma between two <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expressions: MySQL will
interpret the second as an alias name. For example, in the following
statement, <CODE>columnb</CODE> is treated as an alias name:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT columna columnb FROM mytable;
</PRE>

<LI>

It is not allowed to use a column alias in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause,
because the column value may not yet be determined when the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause is executed.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_alias">A.5.4  Problems with <CODE>alias</CODE></A>.

The <CODE>FROM table_references</CODE> clause indicates the tables from which to
retrieve rows. If you name more than one table, you are performing a
join.  For information on join syntax, see section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>.
For each table specified, you may optionally specify an alias.

<PRE>
table_name [[AS] alias] [[USE INDEX (key_list)] | [IGNORE INDEX (key_list)] | FORCE INDEX (key_list)]]
</PRE>

As of MySQL Version 3.23.12, you can give hints about which
index MySQL should use when retrieving information from a
table. This is useful if <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> shows that MySQL is
using the wrong index from the list of possible indexes.  By specifying
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE>, you can tell MySQL to use only one of the
possible indexes to find rows in the table.  The alternative syntax
<CODE>IGNORE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> can be used to tell MySQL to not use some
particular index.

In MySQL 4.0.9 you can also use <CODE>FORCE INDEX</CODE>. This acts likes
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> but with the addition that a table scan
is assumed to be VERY expensive.  In other words a table scan will
only be used if there is no way to use one of the given index to
find rows in the table.

<CODE>USE/IGNORE/FORCE KEY</CODE> are synonyms for <CODE>USE/IGNORE/FORCE INDEX</CODE>.

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> <CODE>USE/IGNORE/FORCE INDEX</CODE> only affects which indexes are
used when MySQL decides how to find rows in the table and how to do the
join. It doesn't affect whether an index will be used when resolving an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

In MySQL 4.0.14 you can use <CODE>SET MAX_SEEKS_FOR_KEY=#</CODE> as an
alternative way to force MySQL to prefer key scans instead of table scans.

<LI>

You can refer to a table as <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> (within the current database),
or as <CODE>dbname.tbl_name</CODE> to explicitly specify a database.
You can refer to a column as <CODE>col_name</CODE>, <CODE>tbl_name.col_name</CODE>, or
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE>.  You need not specify a <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> or
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> prefix for a column reference in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>,
for examples of ambiguity that require the more explicit column reference
forms.

<LI>

From version 4.1.0, you are allowed to specify <CODE>DUAL</CODE> as a dummy
table name, in situations where no tables are referenced. This is purely
compatibility feature, some other servers require this syntax.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 + 1 FROM DUAL;
         -&#62; 2
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1461"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1462"></A>
A table reference may be aliased using <CODE>tbl_name [AS] alias_name</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee AS t1, info AS t2
    -&#62;        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
mysql&#62; SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee t1, info t2
    -&#62;        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
</PRE>

<LI>

Columns selected for output may be referred to in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clauses using column names, column aliases, or column
positions.  Column positions begin with 1:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    -&#62;        ORDER BY region, seed;
mysql&#62; SELECT college, region AS r, seed AS s FROM tournament
    -&#62;        ORDER BY r, s;
mysql&#62; SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    -&#62;        ORDER BY 2, 3;
</PRE>

To sort in reverse order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> (descending) keyword to the
name of the column in the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause that you are sorting by.
The default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using
the <CODE>ASC</CODE> keyword.

<LI>

In the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, you can use any of the functions that
MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary) functions.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Functions">6.3  Functions for Use in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause can refer to any column or alias named in the
<CODE>select_expression</CODE>. It is applied nearly last, just before items are
sent to the client, with no optimisation. (<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> is applied after
<CODE>HAVING</CODE>.) Don't use <CODE>HAVING</CODE> for items that
should be in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  For example, do not write this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name HAVING col_name &#62; 0;
</PRE>

Write this instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name WHERE col_name &#62; 0;
</PRE>

In MySQL Version 3.22.5 or later, you can also write queries like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT user,MAX(salary) FROM users
    -&#62;        GROUP BY user HAVING MAX(salary)&#62;10;
</PRE>

In older MySQL versions, you can write this instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT user,MAX(salary) AS sum FROM users
    -&#62;        group by user HAVING sum&#62;10;
</PRE>

<LI>

The options <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, <CODE>DISTINCTROW</CODE> and <CODE>ALL</CODE> specify
whether duplicate rows should be returned. The default is (<CODE>ALL</CODE>),
all matching rows are returned. <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> and <CODE>DISTINCTROW</CODE>
are synonyms and specify that duplicate rows in the result set should
be removed.

<LI>

<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE>, <CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE>, and options beginning with
<CODE>SQL_</CODE> are MySQL extensions to SQL-99.


<UL>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1463"></A>
<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> forces the optimiser to join the tables in the order in
which they are listed in the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause. You can use this to speed up
a query if the optimiser joins the tables in non-optimal order.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> will give the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> higher priority than
a statement that updates a table.  You should only use this for queries
that are very fast and must be done at once.  A <CODE>SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE>
query will run if the table is locked for read even if there is an update
statement that is waiting for the table to be free.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_BIG_RESULT</CODE> can be used with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>
to tell the optimiser that the result set will have many rows.  In this case,
MySQL will directly use disk-based temporary tables if needed.
MySQL will also, in this case, prefer sorting to doing a
temporary table with a key on the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> elements.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> forces the result to be put into a temporary
table. This helps MySQL free the table locks early and helps
in cases where it takes a long time to send the result set to the client.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, a MySQL-specific option, can be used
with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> to tell the optimiser that the
result set will be small.  In this case, MySQL uses fast
temporary tables to store the resulting table instead of using sorting. In
MySQL Version 3.23 this shouldn't normally be needed.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> (version 4.0.0 and up) tells MySQL to calculate
how many rows there would be in the result set, disregarding any
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause.
The number of rows can then be retrieved with <CODE>SELECT FOUND_ROWS()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

Please note that in versions prior to 4.1.0 this does not work with
<CODE>LIMIT 0</CODE>, which is optimised to return instantly (resulting in a
row count of 0). See section <A HREF="manual.html#LIMIT_optimisation">5.2.9  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>LIMIT</CODE></A>.
<LI>

<CODE>SQL_CACHE</CODE> tells MySQL to store the query result in the query cache
if you are using <CODE>QUERY_CACHE_TYPE=2</CODE> (<CODE>DEMAND</CODE>).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache">6.9  MySQL Query Cache</A>. In case of query with UNIONs and/or subqueries this

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_NO_CACHE</CODE> tells MySQL not to store the query result

If you use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, the output rows will be sorted according to the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> as if you had an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> over all the fields
in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>. MySQL has extended the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause so that
you can also specify <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE> after columns named in the
clause:


<PRE>
SELECT a,COUNT(b) FROM test_table GROUP BY a DESC
</PRE>

<LI>

MySQL has extended the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> to allow you to
select fields that are not mentioned in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause.
If you are not getting the results you expect from your query, please
read the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> description.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Group_by_functions">6.3.7  Functions and Modifiers for Use with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

As of MySQL 4.1.1, <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> allows a <CODE>WITH ROLLUP</CODE> modifier.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GROUP-BY-Modifiers">6.3.7.2  <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Modifiers</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause can be used to constrain the number of rows returned
by the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.  <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> takes one or two numeric
arguments, which must be integer constants.

With one argument, the value specifies the number of rows to return from the
beginning of the result set.
With two arguments, the first specifies the offset of the first row to
return, the second specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
The offset of the initial row is 0 (not 1):

To be compatible with PostgreSQL MySQL also supports the syntax:
<CODE>LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset</CODE>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5,10;  # Retrieve rows 6-15
</PRE>

To retrieve all rows from a certain offset up to the end of the result set,
you can use -1 for the second parameter:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 95,-1; # Retrieve rows 96-last.
</PRE>

If one argument is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows to return:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5;     # Retrieve first 5 rows
</PRE>

In other words, <CODE>LIMIT n</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>LIMIT 0,n</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1465"></A>
The <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'</CODE> form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> writes
the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the server host and
cannot already exist (among other things, this prevents database tables and
files such as <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> from being destroyed).  You must have the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege on the server host to use this form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

The <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> statement is intended primarily to let you very
quickly dump a table on the server machine. If you want to create the
resulting file on some other host than the server host, you can't use
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>. In this case you should instead use some
client program like <CODE>mysqldump --tab</CODE> or <CODE>mysql -e "SELECT
..." &#62; outfile</CODE> to generate the file.

<CODE>SELECT ...  INTO OUTFILE</CODE> is the complement of <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>; the syntax for the <CODE>export_options</CODE> part of the statement
consists of the same <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> clauses that are used
with the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

In the resulting text file, only the following characters are escaped by
the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character:


<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character

<LI>The first character in <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE>

<LI>The first character in <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>

</UL>

Additionally, <CODE>ASCII 0</CODE> is converted to <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> followed by 0
(<CODE>ASCII 48</CODE>).

The reason for the above is that you <STRONG>must</STRONG> escape any <CODE>FIELDS
TERMINATED BY</CODE>, <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>, or <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>
characters to reliably be able to read the file back. <CODE>ASCII 0</CODE> is
escaped to make it easier to view with some pagers.

As the resulting file doesn't have to conform to the SQL syntax, nothing
else need be escaped.

Here follows an example of getting a file in the format used by many
old programs.


<PRE>
SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/result.text"
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
FROM test_table;
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1466"></A>
If you use <CODE>INTO DUMPFILE</CODE> instead of <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, MySQL
will only write one row into the file, without any column or line
terminations and without any escaping.  This is useful if you want to
store a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> value in a file.

<LI>

Note that any file created by <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE> and <CODE>INTO
DUMPFILE</CODE> will be writeable by all users on the server host!  The reason is that the
MySQL server can't create a file that is owned by anyone else
than the user it's running as (you should never run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as
<CODE>root</CODE>).
The file thus must be world-writeable so that you can manipulate its contents.

<LI>

A <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> clause names a procedure that should process the data
in the result set.  For an example, see section <A HREF="manual.html#procedure_analyse">13.3.1  Procedure Analyse</A>.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE> on a storage engine with page or row locks,
the examined rows are write locked until the end of the current
transaction.

<P>
You should generally not have any conditions in the <CODE>ON</CODE> part that are

<UL>
<LI>

A table reference may be aliased using <CODE>tbl_name AS alias_name</CODE> or
<CODE>tbl_name alias_name</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee AS t1, info AS t2
    -&#62;        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>ON</CODE> conditional is any conditional of the form that may be used in
a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

If there is no matching record for the right table in the <CODE>ON</CODE> or
<CODE>USING</CODE> part in a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>, a row with all columns set to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> is used for the right table.  You can use this fact to find
records in a table that have no counterpart in another table:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT table1.* FROM table1
    -&#62;        LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
    -&#62;        WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

This example finds all rows in <CODE>table1</CODE> with an <CODE>id</CODE> value that is
not present in <CODE>table2</CODE> (that is, all rows in <CODE>table1</CODE> with no
corresponding row in <CODE>table2</CODE>).  This assumes that <CODE>table2.id</CODE> is
declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, of course. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LEFT_JOIN_optimisation">5.2.7  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>USING</CODE> <CODE>(column_list)</CODE> clause names a list of columns that must
exist in both tables. The following two clauses are semantically identical:


<PRE>
a LEFT JOIN b USING (c1,c2,c3)
a LEFT JOIN b ON a.c1=b.c1 AND a.c2=b.c2 AND a.c3=b.c3
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>NATURAL [LEFT] JOIN</CODE> of two tables is defined to be
semantically equivalent to an <CODE>INNER JOIN</CODE> or a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>
with a <CODE>USING</CODE> clause that names all columns that exist in both
tables.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1482"></A>
<CODE>INNER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>,</CODE> (comma) are semantically equivalent in
the absence of a join condition: both will produce a Cartesian product
between the specified tables (that is, each and every row in the first table
will be joined onto all rows in the second table).

<LI>

<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> works analogously as <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.  To keep code
portable across databases, it's recommended to use <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>
instead of <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1483"></A>
<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> is identical to <CODE>JOIN</CODE>, except that the left table
is always read before the right table. This can be used for those (few)
cases where the join optimiser puts the tables in the wrong order.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1484"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1485"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1486"></A>
As of MySQL Version 3.23.12, you can give hints about which
index MySQL should use when retrieving information from a
table. This is useful if <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> shows that MySQL is
using the wrong index from the list of possible indexes.  By specifying
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE>, you can tell MySQL to use only one of the
possible indexes to find rows in the table.  The alternative syntax
<CODE>IGNORE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> can be used to tell MySQL to not use some
particular index.

<A NAME="IDX1487"></A>
In MySQL 4.0.9 you can also use <CODE>FORCE INDEX</CODE>. This acts likes
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> but with the addition that a table scan
is assumed to be VERY expensive.  In other words a table scan will
only be used if there is no way to use one of the given index to
find rows in the table.

<A NAME="IDX1488"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1489"></A>
<CODE>USE/IGNORE KEY</CODE> are synonyms for <CODE>USE/IGNORE INDEX</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> <CODE>USE/IGNORE/FORCE INDEX</CODE> only affects which indexes are
used when MySQL decides how to find rows in the table and how to do the
join. It doesn't affect whether an index will be used when resolving an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Some examples:

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table1 USE INDEX (key1,key2)
    -&#62;          WHERE key1=1 AND key2=2 AND key3=3;

The <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> statement provides direct access to the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table

</P>
<P>
The first form of <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> statement opens a table, making
it accessible via subsequent <CODE>HANDLER ... READ</CODE> statements.
This table object is not shared by other threads and will not be closed
until the thread calls <CODE>HANDLER tbl_name CLOSE</CODE> or the thread dies.

</P>

<P>
The second form fetches one row (or more, specified by <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause)
where the index specified complies to the condition and <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
condition is met. If the index consists of several parts (spans over
several columns) the values are specified in comma-separated list,
providing values only for few first columns is possible.

</P>
<P>
The third form fetches one row (or more, specified by <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause)
from the table in index order, matching <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition.

</P>
<P>
The fourth form (without index specification) fetches one row (or more, specified
by <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause) from the table in natural row order (as stored
in datafile) matching <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition. It is faster than
<CODE>HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name</CODE> when a full table scan is desired.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HANDLER ... CLOSE</CODE> closes a table that was opened with
<CODE>HANDLER ... OPEN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note: If you're using <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> interface for <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> you should
remember to quote the keyword PRIMARY with backticks:
<CODE>HANDLER tbl READ `PRIMARY` &#62; (...)</CODE>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HANDLER</CODE> is a somewhat low-level statement.  For example, it does
not provide consistency.  That is, <CODE>HANDLER ... OPEN</CODE> does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG>
take a snapshot of the table, and does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> lock the table. This
means that after a <CODE>HANDLER ... OPEN</CODE> is issued, table data can be
modified (by this or any other thread) and these modifications may appear
only partially in <CODE>HANDLER ... NEXT</CODE> or <CODE>HANDLER ... PREV</CODE> scans.

</P>
<P>
The reasons to use this interface instead of normal SQL are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

It's faster than <CODE>SELECT</CODE> because:

<UL>
<LI>

A designated storage engine is allocated for the thread in <CODE>HANDLER OPEN</CODE>.
<LI>

There is less parsing involved.
<LI>

No optimiser and no query checking overhead.
<LI>

The used table doesn't have to be locked between two handler requests.
<LI>

The handler interface doesn't have to provide a consistent look of the
data (for example, dirty-reads are allowed), so the storage engine can
do optimisations that SQL doesn't normally allow.
</UL>

<LI>

It makes it much easier to port applications that uses an ISAM like
interface to MySQL.
<LI>

It allows one to traverse a database in a manner that is not easy
(in some cases impossible) to do with SQL. The handler interface is
more natural way to look at data when working with applications that
provide an interactive user interfaces to the database.

form with multiple value lists is supported in MySQL Version

</P>
<P>
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is the table into which rows should be inserted.  The column
name list or the <CODE>SET</CODE> clause indicates which columns the statement
specifies values for:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you specify no column list for <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES</CODE> or <CODE>INSERT
... SELECT</CODE>, values for all columns in the table must be provided in the
<CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list or by the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  If you don't know the order of
the columns in the table, use <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> to find out.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1493"></A>
Any column not explicitly given a value is set to its default value.  For
example, if you specify a column list that doesn't name all the columns in
the table, unnamed columns are set to their default values.  Default value
assignment is described in section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

You can also use the keyword <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> to set a column to its
default value. (New in MySQL 4.0.3.)  This makes it easier to write
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements that assign values to all but a few columns,
because it allows you to avoid writing an incomplete <CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list
(a list that does not include a value for each column in the table).
Otherwise, you would have to write out the list of column names
corresponding to each value in the <CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list.

MySQL always has a default value for all fields. This is something
that is imposed on MySQL to be able to work with both transactional
and non-transactional tables.

Our view is that checking of fields content should be done in the
application and not in the database server.

<LI>

An <CODE>expression</CODE> may refer to any column that was set earlier in a value
list.  For example, you can say this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(15,col1*2);
</PRE>

But not this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(col2*2,15);
</PRE>

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>, the server puts the row or
rows to be inserted into a buffer, and the client issuing the <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> statement then may continue on.  If the table is busy, the server
holds the rows.  When the table becomes free, it begins inserting rows,
checking periodically to see if there are new read requests for the
table. If there are, the delayed row queue is suspended until the table
becomes free again.

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the
table. This includes other clients that began reading while existing
clients are reading, and while the <CODE>INSERT LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> statement
is waiting. It is possible therefore for a client that issues an
<CODE>INSERT LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> statement to wait for a very long time (or
even forever) in a read-heavy environment.
(This is in contrast to <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>, which lets the client
continue at once.)  See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_DELAYED">6.4.3.2  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> Syntax</A>.  Note that <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>
should normally not be used with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as this disables
concurrent inserts. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> with many
rows, any rows that duplicate an existing <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
key in the table are ignored and are not inserted.  If you do not specify
<CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, the insert is aborted if there is any row that duplicates an
existing key value.  You can determine with the C API function
<CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> how many rows were inserted into the table.

<LI>

If you specify <CODE>ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE</CODE> clause (new in MySQL 4.1.0), and
a row is inserted that would cause a duplicate value in a <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key, an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> of the old row is performed. For
example, the command:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
    -&#62; ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=c+1;
</PRE>

in case of column <CODE>a</CODE> is declared as <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> and already
holds <CODE>1</CODE> once, would be identical to the


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1;
</PRE>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> that if column <CODE>b</CODE> is unique too, the
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> command would be written as


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1 OR b=2 LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

and if <CODE>a=1 OR b=2</CODE> matches several rows, only <STRONG>one</STRONG> row
will be updated! In general, one should try to avoid using
<CODE>ON DUPLICATE KEY</CODE> clause on tables with multiple <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.

Since MySQL 4.1.1 one can use function <CODE>VALUES(col_name)</CODE>
to refer to the column value in the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> part of the
<CODE>INSERT ... UPDATE</CODE> command - that is the value that would be
inserted if there would be no duplicate key conflict. This function
especially useful in multiple-row inserts. Naturally <CODE>VALUES()</CODE>
function is only meaningful in <CODE>INSERT ... UPDATE</CODE> command
and returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> otherwise.

Example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3),(4,5,6)
    -&#62; ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=VALUES(a)+VALUES(b);
</PRE>

The command above is identical to

INSERT DELAYED ...
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement is a
MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have clients
that can't wait for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to complete.  This is a common
problem when you use MySQL for logging and you also
periodically run <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that take a
long time to complete.  <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> was introduced in MySQL
Version 3.22.15.  It is a MySQL extension to SQL-92.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> only works with <CODE>ISAM</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.  Note that as <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables supports concurrent
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, if there is no free blocks in the
middle of the datafile, you very seldom need to use <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>, the client will get an OK at once
and the row will be inserted when the table is not in use by any other thread.

</P>
<P>
Another major benefit of using <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is that inserts
from many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much
faster than doing many separate inserts.

</P>
<P>
Note that currently the queued rows are only stored in memory until they are
inserted into the table.  This means that if you kill <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
the hard way (<CODE>kill -9</CODE>) or if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies unexpectedly, any
queued rows that weren't written to disk are lost!

</P>
<P>
The following describes in detail what happens when you use the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>.  In this
description, the ``thread'' is the thread that received an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> command and ``handler'' is the thread that handles all
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statements for a particular table.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When a thread executes a <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> statement for a table, a handler
thread is created to process all <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> statements for the table, if
no such handler already exists.

<LI>

The thread checks whether the handler has acquired a <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>
lock already; if not, it tells the handler thread to do so.  The
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> lock can be obtained even if other threads have a <CODE>READ</CODE>
or <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock on the table.  However, the handler will wait for all
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> locks or <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> to ensure that the table
structure is up to date.

<LI>

The thread executes the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement, but instead of writing
the row to the table, it puts a copy of the final row into a queue that
is managed by the handler thread. Any syntax errors are noticed by the
thread and reported to the client program.

<LI>

The client can't report the number of duplicates or the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
value for the resulting row; it can't obtain them from the server, because
the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> returns before the insert operation has been completed.  If
you use the C API, the <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> function doesn't return anything
meaningful, for the same reason.

<LI>

The binary log is updated by the handler thread when the row is inserted into
the table.  In case of multiple-row inserts, the binary log is updated when
the first row is inserted.

<LI>

After every <CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE> rows are written, the handler checks
whether any <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are still pending.  If so, it
allows these to execute before continuing.

<A NAME="IDX1500"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1501"></A>
<LI>

When the handler has no more rows in its queue, the table is unlocked.  If no
new <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> commands are received within
<CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE> seconds, the handler terminates.

<LI>

If more than <CODE>delayed_queue_size</CODE> rows are pending already in a
specific handler queue, the thread requesting <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
waits until there is room in the queue.  This is done to ensure that
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't use all memory for the delayed memory
queue.

<LI>

The handler thread will show up in the MySQL process list
with <CODE>delayed_insert</CODE> in the <CODE>Command</CODE> column.  It will
be killed if you execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> command or kill it with
<CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE>. However, it will first store all queued rows into the
table before exiting. During this time it will not accept any new
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands from another thread. If you execute an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> command after this, a new handler thread will be created.

Note that the above means that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> commands have higher
priority than normal <CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands if there is an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> handler already running!  Other update commands will have to wait
until the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> queue is empty, someone kills the handler
thread (with <CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE>), or someone executes <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.

<LI>

The following status variables provide information about <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> commands:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Variable</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Delayed_insert_threads</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of handler threads
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Delayed_writes</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of rows written with <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Not_flushed_delayed_rows</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of rows waiting to be written
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

You can view these variables by issuing a <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE> statement or
by executing a <CODE>mysqladmin extended-status</CODE> command.
</UL>

<P>
Note that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is slower than a normal INSERT if the
table is not in use.  There is also the additional overhead for the
server to handle a separate thread for each table on which you use
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  This means that you should only use <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> when you are really sure you need it!

    [WHERE where_definition]
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> updates columns in existing table rows with new values.
The <CODE>SET</CODE> clause indicates which columns to modify and the values
they should be given.  The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, if given, specifies
which rows should be updated.  Otherwise, all rows are updated. If the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause is specified, the rows will be updated in the
order that is specified.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, the update statement will not
abort even if we get duplicate key errors during the update.  Rows that
would cause conflicts will not be updated.

</P>
<P>
If you access a column from <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in an expression,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> uses the current value of the column.  For example, the
following statement sets the <CODE>age</CODE> column to one more than its
current value:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE persondata SET age=age+1;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> assignments are evaluated from left to right.  For example, the
following statement doubles the <CODE>age</CODE> column, then increments it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE persondata SET age=age*2, age=age+1;
</PRE>

<P>
If you set a column to the value it currently has, MySQL notices
this and doesn't update it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1503"></A>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> returns the number of rows that were actually changed.
In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the C API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>
returns the number of rows that were matched and updated and the number of
warnings that occurred during the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
If you update a column that has been declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> by
setting to <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the column is set to the default value appropriate
for the column type and the warning count is incremented.  The default
value is is <CODE>0</CODE> for numeric types, the empty string (<CODE>''</CODE>)
for string types, and the ``zero'' value for date and time types.

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL version 3.23, you can use <CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> to ensure
that only a given number of rows are changed.  MySQL will stop the
update as soon as it has found <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> rows that satisfies the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, independent of the rows changed content or not.

</P>
<P>
If an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause is used (available from MySQL 4.0.0), the rows
will be updated in that order. This is really only useful in conjunction
with <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 4.0.4, you can also perform <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
operations that cover multiple tables:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE items,month SET items.price=month.price
WHERE items.id=month.id;

<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

<P>
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> deletes rows from <CODE>table_name</CODE> that satisfy the condition
given by <CODE>where_definition</CODE>, and returns the number of records deleted.

</P>
<P>
If you issue a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, all rows are
deleted.  If you do this in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, this works as
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TRUNCATE">6.4.6  <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  In MySQL 3.23,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will return zero as the number
of affected records.

</P>
<P>
If you really want to know how many records are deleted when you are deleting
all rows, and are willing to suffer a speed penalty, you can use a
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement of this form:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM table_name WHERE 1&#62;0;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this is much slower than <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> with no
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, because it deletes rows one at a time.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

</P>
<P>
For MyISAM tables,
if you specify the word <CODE>QUICK</CODE> then the storage engine will not
merge index leaves during delete, which may speed up certain kind of
deletes.

</P>
<P>
The speed of delete operations may also be affected by factors discussed in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Delete_speed">5.2.12  Speed of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Queries</A>.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, deleted records are maintained in a linked list and
subsequent <CODE>INSERT</CODE> operations reuse old record positions. To
reclaim unused space and reduce file-sizes, use the <CODE>OPTIMIZE
TABLE</CODE> statement or the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility to reorganise tables.
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is easier, but <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is faster.  See
section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> and section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

</P>
<P>
The first multi-table delete format is supported starting from MySQL 4.0.0.
The second multi-table delete format is supported starting from MySQL 4.0.2.

</P>
<P>
The idea is that only matching rows from the tables listed
<STRONG>before</STRONG> the <CODE>FROM</CODE> or before the <CODE>USING</CODE> clause are
deleted. The effect is that you can delete rows from many tables at the
same time and also have additional tables that are used for searching.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>.*</CODE> after the table names is there just to be compatible with
<CODE>Access</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
DELETE t1,t2 FROM t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id

or

DELETE FROM t1,t2 USING t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id
</PRE>

<P>
In the above case we delete matching rows just from tables <CODE>t1</CODE> and
<CODE>t2</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause is used (available from MySQL 4.0.0), the rows
will be deleted in that order. This is really only useful in conjunction
with <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
DELETE FROM somelog
WHERE user = 'jcole'
ORDER BY timestamp
LIMIT 1
</PRE>

<P>
This will delete the oldest entry (by <CODE>timestamp</CODE>) where the row matches
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL-specific <CODE>LIMIT row_count</CODE> option to <CODE>DELETE</CODE> tells
the server the maximum number of rows to be deleted before control is
returned to the client.  This can be used to ensure that a specific
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> command doesn't take too much time.  You can simply repeat
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> command until the number of affected rows is less than
the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
From MySQL 4.0, you can specify multiple tables in the <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
statement to delete rows from one or more tables depending on a particular
condition in multiple tables. However, you can not use <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
or <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> in a multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> differs from <CODE>DELETE FROM ...</CODE>
in the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is much faster
than deleting rows one by one.
<LI>

Not transaction-safe; you will get an error if you have an active
transaction or an active table lock.
<LI>

Doesn't return the number of deleted rows.
<LI>

As long as the table definition file <TT>`table_name.frm'</TT> is
valid, the table can be re-created this way, even if the data or index
files have become corrupted.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> is an Oracle SQL extension.
This statement was added in MySQL 3.23.28, although from 3.23.28

<P>
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> works exactly like <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, except that if an old
record in the table has the same value as a new record on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
index or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, the old record is deleted before the new
record is inserted.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
In other words, you can't access the values of the old row from a
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> statement.  In some old MySQL versions it appeared that
you could do this, but that was a bug that has been corrected.

</P>
<P>
To be able to use <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> you must have <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges for the table.

</P>
<P>
When you use a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>
will return 2 if the new row replaced an old row.  This is because
one row was inserted after the duplicate was deleted.

</P>
<P>
This fact makes it easy to determine whether <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> added
or replaced a row: check whether the affected-rows value is 1 (added)
or 2 (replaced).

</P>
<P>
Note that unless the table has a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>,
using a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command makes no sense. It becomes equivalent to
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, because there is no index to be used to determine whether a new
row duplicates another.

For security reasons, when reading text files located on the server, the

the table at the same time.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> will be a bit slower than letting the server access the
files directly, because the contents of the file must be sent over the
connection by the client
to the server.  On the other hand, you do not need the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege to load local files.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL before Version 3.23.24 you can't read from a
FIFO with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.  If you need to read from a FIFO (for
example the output from gunzip), use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE>
instead.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1508"></A>
You can also load datafiles by using the <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> utility; it
operates by sending a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command to the server.  The
<CODE>--local</CODE> option causes <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> to read datafiles from the
client host.  You can specify the <CODE>--compress</CODE> option to get better
performance over slow networks if the client and server support the
compressed protocol.

</P>
<P>
When locating files on the server host, the server uses the following rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as is.

<LI>

If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is given,
the server searches for the file relative to the server's data directory.

<LI>

If a filename with no leading components is given, the server looks for
the file in the database directory of the current database.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these rules mean a file named as <TT>`./myfile.txt'</TT> is read from
the server's data directory, whereas the same file named as <TT>`myfile.txt'</TT> is
read from the database directory of the current database.  For example,
the following <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement reads the file <TT>`data.txt'</TT>
from the database directory for <CODE>db1</CODE> because <CODE>db1</CODE> is the current
database, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a
table in the <CODE>db2</CODE> database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE db1;
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "data.txt" INTO TABLE db2.my_table;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> and <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> keywords control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.

</P>
<P>
If you specify <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, input rows replace existing rows (in other
words rows that has the same value for a primary or unique index as an
existing row). See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPLACE">6.4.7  <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you specify <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, input rows that duplicate an existing row
on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option,
the behaviour depends on whether or not the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> keyword is specified.
Without <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is
found, and the rest of the text file is ignored.  With <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>,
the default behaviour is the same as if <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is specified;
this is because the server has no way to stop transmission of the file
in the middle of the operation.

</P>
<P>
If you want to ignore foreign key constraints during load you can do
<CODE>SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0</CODE> before executing <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on an empty <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, all
non-unique indexes are created in a separate batch (like in
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>).  This normally makes <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> much faster
when you have many indexes.  Normally this is very fast, but in some
extreme cases you can create the indexes even faster by turning them off
with <CODE>ALTER TABLE .. DISABLE KEYS</CODE> and use <CODE>ALTER TABLE .. ENABLE
KEYS</CODE> to recreate the indexes.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is the complement of <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
To write data from a table to a file, use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
To read the file back into a table, use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
The syntax of the <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> clauses is the same for
both commands.  Both clauses are optional, but <CODE>FIELDS</CODE>
must precede <CODE>LINES</CODE> if both are specified.

</P>
<P>
If you specify a <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause,
each of its subclauses (<CODE>TERMINATED BY</CODE>, <CODE>[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED
BY</CODE>, and <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>) is also optional, except that you must
specify at least one of them.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify a <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause, the defaults are the
same as if you had written this:

</P>

<PRE>
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't specify a <CODE>LINES</CODE> clause, the default
is the same as if you had written this:

</P>

<PRE>
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If you have generated the text file on a Windows system
you may have to change the above to: <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'</CODE>
as Windows uses two characters as a line terminator. Some programs, like
<CODE>wordpad</CODE>, may use <CODE>\r</CODE> as a line terminator.

</P>
<P>
If all the lines you want to read in has a common prefix that you want
to skip, you can use <CODE>LINES STARTING BY prefix_string</CODE> for this.

</P>
<P>
In other words, the defaults cause <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to act as follows
when reading input:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Look for line boundaries at newlines.

<LI>

If <CODE>LINES STARTING BY prefix</CODE> is used, read until prefix is found
and start reading at character after prefix.  If line doesn't include prefix
it will be skipped.

<LI>

Break lines into fields at tabs.

<LI>

Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting characters.

<LI>

Interpret occurrences of tab, newline, or <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> preceded by
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> as literal characters that are part of field values.
</UL>

<P>
Conversely, the defaults cause <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> to act as
follows when writing output:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Write tabs between fields.

<LI>

Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> to escape instances of tab, newline or <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that occur
within field values.

<LI>

Write newlines at the ends of lines.
</UL>

<P>
Note that to write <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\\'</CODE>, you must specify two
backslashes for the value to be read as a single backslash.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>IGNORE number LINES</CODE> option can be used to ignore lines at
the start of the file.  For example, you can use <CODE>IGNORE 1 LINES</CODE>
to skip over an initial header line containing column names:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/file_name" INTO TABLE test IGNORE 1 LINES;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> in tandem with <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> to write data from a database into a file and then read
the file back into the database later, the field and line handling
options for both commands must match.  Otherwise, <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE> will not interpret the contents of the file properly.  Suppose
you use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> to write a file with
fields delimited by commas:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
    -&#62;          FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    -&#62;          FROM ...;
</PRE>

<P>
To read the comma-delimited file back in, the correct statement would be:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
    -&#62;           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
</PRE>

<P>
If instead you tried to read in the file with the statement shown here, it
wouldn't work because it instructs <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to look for
tabs between fields:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
    -&#62;           FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
</PRE>

<P>
The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as
a single field.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> can be used to read files obtained from
external sources, too. For example, a file in dBASE format will have
fields separated by commas and enclosed in double quotes.  If lines in
the file are terminated by newlines, the command shown here
illustrates the field and line handling options you would use to load
the file:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
    -&#62;           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
    -&#62;           LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
</PRE>

<P>
Any of the field or line handling options may specify an empty string
(<CODE>''</CODE>).  If not empty, the <CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
and <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> values must be a single character.  The
<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> values may
be more than one character.  For example, to write lines that are
terminated by carriage return-linefeed pairs, or to read a file
containing such lines, specify a <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'</CODE>
clause.

</P>
<P>
For example, to read a file of jokes, that are separated with a line
of <CODE>%%</CODE>, into an SQL table you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE jokes (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, joke TEXT
NOT NULL);
LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/jokes.txt" INTO TABLE jokes FIELDS TERMINATED BY ""
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n%%\n" (joke);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE> controls quoting of fields.  For
output (<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>), if you omit the word
<CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>, all fields are enclosed by the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
character.  An example of such output (using a comma as the field
delimiter) is shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
"1","a string","100.20"
"2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
"3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
"4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"
</PRE>

<P>
If you specify <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>, the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character is
used only to enclose <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> fields:

</P>

<PRE>
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20
</PRE>

<P>
Note that occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character within a
field value are escaped by prefixing them with the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>
character.  Also note that if you specify an empty <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>
value, it is possible to generate output that cannot be read properly by
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. For example, the preceding output just shown would
appear as follows if the escape character is empty.  Observe that the
second field in the fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which
(erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

</P>

<PRE>
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20
</PRE>

<P>
For input, the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character, if present, is stripped
from the ends of field values.  (This is true whether <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>
is specified; <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE> has no effect on input interpretation.)
Occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character preceded by the
<CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character are interpreted as part of the current
field value.

</P>
<P>
If the field begins with the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character, instances
of that character are recognized as terminating a field value only
if followed by the field or line <CODE>TERMINATED BY</CODE> sequence.
To avoid ambiguity, occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character
within a field value can be doubled and will be interpreted as a
single instance of the character.  For example, if <CODE>ENCLOSED
BY '"'</CODE> is specified, quotes are handled as shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
"The ""BIG"" boss"  -&#62; The "BIG" boss
The "BIG" boss      -&#62; The "BIG" boss
The ""BIG"" boss    -&#62; The ""BIG"" boss
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> controls how to write or read special characters.
If the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is not empty, it is used to prefix
the following characters on output:

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character
<LI>

The <CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character
<LI>

The first character of the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> values
<LI>

ASCII <CODE>0</CODE> (what is actually written following the escape character is
ASCII <CODE>'0'</CODE>, not a zero-valued byte)
</UL>

<P>
If the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is empty, no characters are escaped.
It is probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character,
particularly if field values in your data contain any of the characters in
the list just given.

</P>
<P>
For input, if the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is not empty, occurrences
of that character are stripped and the following character is taken literally
as part of a field value.  The exceptions are an escaped <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`N'</SAMP> (for example, <CODE>\0</CODE> or <CODE>\N</CODE> if the escape character is
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  These sequences are interpreted as ASCII <CODE>0</CODE> (a zero-valued
byte) and <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  See below for the rules on <CODE>NULL</CODE> handling.

</P>
<P>
For more information about <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-escape syntax,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Literals">6.1.1  Literals: How to Write Strings and Numbers</A>.

</P>
<P>
In certain cases, field and line handling options interact:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> is an empty string and <CODE>FIELDS
TERMINATED BY</CODE> is non-empty, lines are also terminated with
<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE>.
<LI>

If the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> values
are both empty (<CODE>''</CODE>), a fixed-row (non-delimited) format is used.
With fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields (but you
can still have a line terminator). Instead, column values are written
and read using the ``display'' widths of the columns.  For example, if a
column is declared as <CODE>INT(7)</CODE>, values for the column are written
using 7-character fields.  On input, values for the column are obtained
by reading 7 characters.

<CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> is still used to separate lines.  If a line
doesn't contain all fields, the rest of the fields will be set to their
default values. If you don't have a line terminator, you should set this
to <CODE>''</CODE>.  In this case the text file must contain all fields for
each row.

Fixed-row format also affects handling of <CODE>NULL</CODE> values; see below.
Note that fixed-size format will not work if you are using a multi-byte
character set.
</UL>

<P>
Handling of <CODE>NULL</CODE> values varies, depending on the <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES</CODE> options you use:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For the default <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> values,
<CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as <CODE>\N</CODE> for output and <CODE>\N</CODE> is read
as <CODE>NULL</CODE> for input (assuming the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character
is <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> is not empty, a field containing the literal
word <CODE>NULL</CODE> as its value is read as a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value (this differs
from the word <CODE>NULL</CODE> enclosed within <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
characters, which is read as the string <CODE>'NULL'</CODE>).

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> is empty, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as the word
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

With fixed-row format (which happens when <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and
<CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> are both empty), <CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as an empty
string.  Note that this causes both <CODE>NULL</CODE> values and empty strings in
the table to be indistinguishable when written to the file because they are
both written as empty strings.  If you need to be able to tell the two apart
when reading the file back in, you should not use fixed-row format.
</UL>

<P>
Some cases are not supported by <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>:

<UL>

<LI>

Fixed-size rows (<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED
BY</CODE> both empty) and <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.

<LI>

If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix of another,
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> won't be able to interpret the input properly.
For example, the following <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause would cause problems:


<PRE>
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'
</PRE>

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> is empty, a field value that contains an occurrence
of <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> or <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>
followed by the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> value will cause <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> to stop reading a field or line too early.
This happens because <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> cannot properly determine
where the field or line value ends.
</UL>

<P>
The following example loads all columns of the <CODE>persondata</CODE> table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;
</PRE>

<P>
No field list is specified, so <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> expects input rows
to contain a field for each table column.  The default <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES</CODE> values are used.

</P>
<P>
If you wish to load only some of a table's columns, specify a field list:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt'
    -&#62;           INTO TABLE persondata (col1,col2,...);
</PRE>

<P>
You must also specify a field list if the order of the fields in the input
file differs from the order of the columns in the table.  Otherwise,
MySQL cannot tell how to match up input fields with table columns.

</P>
<P>
If a row has too few fields, the columns for which no input field is present
are set to default values.  Default value assignment is described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
An empty field value is interpreted differently than if the field value
is missing:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For string types, the column is set to the empty string.

<LI>

For numeric types, the column is set to <CODE>0</CODE>.

<LI>

For date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate ``zero''
value for the type.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these are the same values that result if you assign an empty
string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type explicitly
in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns are only set to the current date and time if there
is a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value for the column (that is, <CODE>\N</CODE>), or (for the
first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column only) if the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is
omitted from the field list when a field list is specified.

</P>
<P>
If an input row has too many fields, the extra fields are ignored and
the number of warnings is incremented.  Note that before MySQL 4.1.1 the
warnings is just a number to indicate that something went wrong.
In MySQL 4.1.1 you can do <CODE>SHOW WARNINGS</CODE> to get more information for
what went wrong.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> regards all input as strings, so you can't use
numeric values for <CODE>ENUM</CODE> or <CODE>SET</CODE> columns the way you can with
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  All <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> values must be
specified as strings!

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1509"></A>
If you are using the C API, you can get information about the query by
calling the API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> when the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>
query finishes.  The format of the information string is shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
</PRE>

<P>
Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are inserted
via the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement (see section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>), except
that <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> also generates warnings when there are too few
or too many fields in the input row.  The warnings are not stored anywhere;
the number of warnings can only be used as an indication if everything went
well.

</P>
<P>
If you get warnings and want to know exactly why you got them, one way
to do this is to use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> into another file
and compare this to your original input file.

</P>
<P>
If you need <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> to read from a pipe, you can use the
following trick:

</P>

<PRE>
mkfifo /mysql/db/x/x
chmod 666 /mysql/db/x/x
cat &#60; /dev/tcp/10.1.1.12/4711 &#62; /nt/mysql/db/x/x
mysql -e "LOAD DATA INFILE 'x' INTO TABLE x" x
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using a version of MySQL older than 3.23.25
you can only do the above with <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.1.1 you can use <CODE>SHOW WARNINGS</CODE> to get a list of the first
<CODE>max_error_count</CODE> warnings. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_WARNINGS">4.5.7.9  <CODE>SHOW WARNINGS | ERRORS</CODE></A>.

<P>
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> creates a table with the given name.
Rules for allowable table names are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>.  
By default, the table is created in the current database.  
An error occurs if the table already exists, if there is no current database,
or if the database does not exist.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the table name can be specified as
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> to create the table in a specific database.
This works regardless of whether there is a current database.

</P>
<P>
From MySQL Version 3.23, you can use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword when
you create a table. The temporary table is visible only to the
current connection, and will be deleted automatically when the
connection is closed.  This means that two different
connections can both use the same temporary table name without conflicting
with each other or with an existing table of the same name. (The existing table
is hidden until the temporary table is deleted.)  From MySQL 4.0.2 on, you must
have the <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE> privilege to be able to create
temporary tables.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23 or later, you can use the keywords
<CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> so that an error does not occur if the table already
exists.  Note that there is no verification that the existing table has a
structure identical to that indicated by the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
From version 4.1.0, the attribute <CODE>SERIAL</CODE> can be used as an alias for
<CODE>BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE</CODE>. This is compatibility feature.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1518"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1519"></A>

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 3.23, you can create one table from another by adding a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement at the end of the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl;
</PRE>

<P>
Indexes are not carried over to the new table, and some conversion of column
types may occur. For example, the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> attribute is not
preserved, and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns may become <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.1, you can explicitly specify the type for a generated column:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE foo (a tinyint not null) SELECT b+1 AS 'a' FROM bar;
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL 4.1, you can also use <CODE>LIKE</CODE> to create a table based on the
definition of another table, including any column attributes and
indexes the original table has:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE new_tbl LIKE orig_tbl;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... LIKE</CODE> does not copy any <CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> or
<CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE> table options that were specified for the original
table.

</P>
<P>
Each table <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is represented by some files in the database
directory. In the case of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>-type tables you will get:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>File</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>

</TABLE>

<P>
For more information on the properties of the various column types, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If neither <CODE>NULL</CODE> nor <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> is specified, the column
is treated as though <CODE>NULL</CODE> had been specified.

<LI>

An integer column may have the additional attribute <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>.
When you insert a value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> (recommended) or <CODE>0</CODE> into an
indexed
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the column is set to the next sequence value.
Typically this is <CODE>value+1</CODE>, where
<CODE>value</CODE> is the largest value for the column currently in the table.
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> sequences begin with <CODE>1</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">11.1.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

If you delete the row containing the maximum value for an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the value will be reused for an
<CODE>ISAM</CODE> or <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, but not for a
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table.  If you delete all rows in the table
with <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> (without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>) in
<CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, the sequence starts over for all table types except
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_auto-increment_column">7.5.12.5  How an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> Column Works in InnoDB</A>.

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: there can be only one <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column per
table, it must be indexed and it can't have a <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value.
In MySQL Version 3.23, an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column will work properly
only if it contains only positive values. Inserting a
negative number is regarded as inserting a very large positive number.
This is done to avoid precision problems when numbers ``wrap'' over from
positive to negative and also to ensure that one doesn't accidentally
get an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column that contains 0.

In <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables you can specify <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
secondary column in a multiple-column key.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#example-AUTO_INCREMENT">3.6.9  Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE></A>.

<A NAME="IDX1520"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1521"></A>
To make MySQL compatible with some ODBC applications, you can find the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value for the last inserted row with the following query:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values are handled differently for <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns than
for other column types.  You cannot store a literal <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column; setting the column to <CODE>NULL</CODE> sets it to the
current date and time.  Because <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns behave this way, the
<CODE>NULL</CODE> and <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> attributes do not apply in the normal way and
are ignored if you specify them.

On the other hand, to make it easier for MySQL clients to use
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns, the server reports that such columns may be
assigned <CODE>NULL</CODE> values (which is true), even though <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
never actually will contain a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  You can see this when you
use <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> to get a description of your table.

Note that setting a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to <CODE>0</CODE> is not the same
as setting it to <CODE>NULL</CODE>, because <CODE>0</CODE> is a valid <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
value.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1522"></A>
A <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value has to be a constant, it cannot be a function or
an expression.

If no <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value is specified for a column, MySQL
automatically assigns one, as follows.

If the column may take <CODE>NULL</CODE> as a value, the default value is
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

If the column is declared as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, the default value depends on
the column type:


<UL>
<LI>

For numeric types other than those declared with the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
attribute, the default is <CODE>0</CODE>.  For an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the
default value is the next value in the sequence.

<LI>

For date and time types other than <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, the default is the
appropriate zero value for the type.  For the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column in a table, the default value is the current date and time.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.

<LI>

For string types other than <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the default value is the empty
string.  For <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the default is the first enumeration value.
</UL>

Default values must be constants. This means, for example, that you cannot
set the default for a date column to be the value of a function such as
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> or <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1523"></A>
A comment for a column may be specified with the <CODE>COMMENT</CODE> option.
The comment is displayed by the
<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement, and by <CODE>SHOW FULL COLUMNS</CODE>.
This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.
(It is allowed but ignored in earlier versions.)

<LI>

<CODE>KEY</CODE> is normally a synonym for <CODE>INDEX</CODE>.
From version 4.1, the key attribute <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> may also be
specified as just <CODE>KEY</CODE>. This was implemented for compatibility
with other databases.

<LI>

In MySQL, a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key can have only distinct values. An
error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key that matches an existing
row.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1524"></A>
A <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> is a unique <CODE>KEY</CODE> where all key columns must be
defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>. If they are not explicitly declared as
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, it will be done implicitly (and quietly).  In MySQL
the key is named <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>. A table can have only one <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.
If you don't have a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> and some applications ask for the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in your tables, MySQL will return the first
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key, which doesn't have any <CODE>NULL</CODE> columns, as the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.

<LI>

A <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> can be a multiple-column index.  However, you cannot
create a multiple-column index using the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> key attibute in a
column specification.  Doing so will mark only that single column as primary.
You must use a separate <CODE>PRIMARY KEY(index_col_name, ...)</CODE> clause.

<LI>

A <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index is one in which all values in the index must be
distinct. The exception to this is that if a column in the index is allowed
to contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> values, it may contain multiple <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
This exception does not apply to <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, which allow only a single
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

If the <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key consists of only one column and this
is of type integer, you can also refer to it as <CODE>_rowid</CODE>
(new in Version 3.23.11).

<LI>

If you don't assign a name to an index that is not a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>,
the index will be assigned the same
name as the first <CODE>index_col_name</CODE>, with an optional suffix (<CODE>_2</CODE>,
<CODE>_3</CODE>, <CODE>...</CODE>) to make it unique.  You can see index names for a
table using <CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Show_database_info">4.5.7.1  Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1526"></A>
Only the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, and <CODE>BDB</CODE> table types support indexes on columns that can have
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values. In other cases you must declare such columns
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> or an error results.

<LI>

With <CODE>col_name(length)</CODE> syntax in an index specification, you can create
an index that uses only the first <CODE>length</CODE> bytes of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE>
or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column. This can make the index file much smaller.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Indexes">5.4.4  Column Indexes</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1527"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1530"></A>
Only the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and (as of MySQL 4.0.14)
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table types support indexing on <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.  When putting an index on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>
column you MUST always specify the length of the index, up to 255 bytes. For
example:

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
</PRE>

<LI>

An <CODE>index_col_name</CODE> specification may end with <CODE>ASC</CODE> or <CODE>DESC</CODE>.
These keywords are allowed for future extensions for specifying ascending
or descending index value storage.  Currently they are parsed but ignored;
index values are always stored in ascending order.

<LI>

When you use <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> or
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> column, the server sorts values using only the initial number of
bytes indicated by the <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> server variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They can be created
only from <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column; partial indexing is not
supported. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A> for details of operation.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.23.44 or later, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support checking of
foreign key constraints. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>. Note that the
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is more restrictive than
the syntax presented above: The columns of the referenced
table must always be explicitly named.
InnoDB supports both <CODE>ON DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>ON UPDATE</CODE>
actions on foreign keys as of MySQL 3.23.50 and 4.0.8, respectively.
See the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> manual section for the precise syntax.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints">7.5.5.2  <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> Constraints</A>.
For other table types, MySQL Server does parse the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>,
<CODE>CHECK</CODE>, and <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> syntax in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> commands,
but without further action being taken. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys">1.7.4.5  Foreign Keys</A>.

<LI>

For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables,
each <CODE>NULL</CODE> column takes one bit extra, rounded up to the nearest byte.
The maximum record length in bytes can be calculated as follows:


<PRE>
row length = 1
             + (sum of column lengths)
             + (number of NULL columns + delete_flag + 7)/8
             + (number of variable-length columns)
</PRE>

<CODE>delete_flag</CODE> is 1 for tables with static record format. Static
tables use a bit in the row record for a flag that indicates whether
the row has been deleted.  <CODE>delete_flag</CODE> is 0 for dynamic tables
because the flag is stored in the dynamic row header.

These calculations do not apply for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, for which
storage size is not different for <CODE>NULL</CODE> columns compared to <CODE>NOT
NULL</CODE> columns.

<LI>

The <CODE>table_options</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> options are only
implemented in MySQL Version 3.23 and above.

The <CODE>TYPE</CODE> option for specifying the table type takes the following
values:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Table type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>BDB</CODE> or <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> </TD><TD> Transaction-safe tables with page locking. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.6  <CODE>BDB</CODE> or <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> Tables</A>.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

If a table type is specified, and that particular type is not available,
MySQL will use <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> instead.
For example, if a table definition includes the <CODE>TYPE=BDB</CODE> option but the
MySQL server does not support <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, the table will be created
as a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.  This makes it possible to have a replication
setup where you have transactional tables on the master but tables created
on the slave are non-transactional (to get more speed).  In MySQL 4.1.1 you
get a warning if the specified table type is not honored.

The other table options are used to optimise the behaviour of the
table. In most cases, you don't have to specify any of them.
The options work for all table types, unless otherwise indicated:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> </TD><TD> The next <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value you want to set for your table (<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> only; to set the first auto-increment value for an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table, insert a dummy row with a value one less, and delete the dummy row).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> </TD><TD> An approximation of the average row length for your table. You only need to set this for large tables with variable size records.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CHECKSUM</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if you want MySQL to maintain a checksum for all rows (makes the table a little slower to update but makes it easier to find corrupted tables) (<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> only).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>COMMENT</CODE> </TD><TD> A 60-character comment for your table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Maximum number of rows you plan to store in the table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MIN_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Minimum number of rows you plan to store in the table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if you want to have a smaller index.  This usually makes updates slower and reads faster (<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> only). Setting this to 0 will disable all packing of keys. Setting this to <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> (MySQL 4.0) will tell the storage engine to only pack long <CODE>CHAR</CODE>/<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PASSWORD</CODE> </TD><TD> Encrypt the <TT>`.frm'</TT> file with a password.  This option doesn't do anything in the standard MySQL version.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if want to delay key table updates until the table is closed (<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> only).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>ROW_FORMAT</CODE> </TD><TD> Defines how the rows should be stored. Currently this option only works with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, which supports the <CODE>DYNAMIC</CODE> and <CODE>FIXED</CODE> row formats. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Formats</A>.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

When you use a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, MySQL uses the product of
<CODE>MAX_ROWS * AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> to decide how big the resulting table
will be.  If you don't specify any of the above options, the maximum size
for a table will be 4G (or 2G if your operating systems only supports 2G
tables). The reason for this is just to keep down the pointer sizes
to make the index smaller and faster if you don't really need big files.

If you don't use <CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE>, the default is to only pack strings,
not numbers.  If you use <CODE>PACK_KEYS=1</CODE>, numbers will be packed as well.

When packing binary number keys, MySQL will use prefix compression.
This means that you will only get a big benefit from this if you have
many numbers that are the same.  Prefix compression means that every
key needs one extra byte to indicate how many bytes of the previous key are
the same for the next key (note that the pointer to the row is stored
in high-byte-first order directly after the key, to improve
compression).  This means that if you have many equal keys on two consecutive
rows, all following ``same'' keys will usually only take 2 bytes
(including the pointer to the row).  Compare this to the ordinary case
where the following keys will take storage_size_for_key +
pointer_size (usually 4).  On the other hand, if all keys are
totally different, you will use 1 byte more per key, if the key isn't a
key that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE> values. (In this case the packed key length will
be stored in the same byte that is used to mark if a key is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.)

<LI>

As of MySQL 3.23,
if you specify a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> after the <CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement,
MySQL will create new fields for all elements in the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    -&#62;        PRIMARY KEY (a), KEY(b))
    -&#62;        TYPE=MyISAM SELECT b,c FROM test2;
</PRE>

This will create a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table with three columns, a, b, and c.
Notice that the columns from the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement are appended to
the right side of the table, not overlapped onto it.  Take the following
example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM foo;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+

mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE bar (m INT) SELECT n FROM foo;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM bar;
+------+---+
| m    | n |
+------+---+
| NULL | 1 |
+------+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

For each row in table <CODE>foo</CODE>, a row is inserted in <CODE>bar</CODE> with
the values from <CODE>foo</CODE> and default values for the new columns.

<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</CODE> will not automatically create any indexes
for you.  This is done intentionally to make the command as flexible as
possible.  If you want to have indexes in the created table, you should
specify these before the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE bar (UNIQUE (n)) SELECT n FROM foo;
</PRE>

If any errors occur while copying the data to the table, it will
automatically be deleted.

You can precede the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> by <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> or <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>
to indicate how to handle records that duplicate unique key values.
With <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, new records that duplicate an existing record on a
unique key value are discarded.  With <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, new records replace
records that have the same unique key value.  If neither <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>
nor <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> are specified, duplicate unique key values result in
an error.

To ensure that the update log/binary log can be used to re-create the
original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</CODE>.
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1531"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1532"></A>
The <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> option will help you to exceed the 2G/4G limit for
the MyISAM datafile (not the index file) on operating systems that
don't support big files. Note that this option is not recommended for
filesystem that supports big files!

You can get more speed from the I/O bottleneck by putting <CODE>RAID</CODE>
directories on different physical disks. <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> will work on
any OS, as long as you have configured MySQL with <CODE>--with-raid</CODE>.
For now the only allowed <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> is <CODE>STRIPED</CODE> (<CODE>1</CODE>
and <CODE>RAID0</CODE> are aliases for this).

If you specify <CODE>RAID_TYPE=STRIPED</CODE> for a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will create <CODE>RAID_CHUNKS</CODE> subdirectories named 00,
01, 02 in the database directory.  In each of these directories
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will create a <CODE>table_name.MYD</CODE>.  When writing data
to the datafile, the <CODE>RAID</CODE> handler will map the first
<CODE>RAID_CHUNKSIZE</CODE> *1024 bytes to the first file, the next
<CODE>RAID_CHUNKSIZE</CODE> *1024 bytes to the next file and so on.
<LI>

<CODE>UNION</CODE> is used when you want to use a collection of identical
tables as one. This only works with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.

For the moment you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges on the tables you map to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
All mapped tables must be in the same database as the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

<LI>

If you want to insert data in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you have to specify with
<CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> into with table the row should be inserted.
<CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> is an option useful for <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables only. 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>. This option was introduced in MySQL 4.0.0.

<LI>

In the created table the <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> key will be placed first, followed
by all <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys and then the normal keys.  This helps the
MySQL optimiser to prioritise which key to use and also more quickly
detect duplicated <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.

<LI>

By using <CODE>DATA DIRECTORY="directory"</CODE> or <CODE>INDEX
DIRECTORY="directory"</CODE> you can specify where the storage engine should
put it's table and index files.  Note that the directory should be a full
path to the directory (not relative path).

This only works for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0, when you
are not using the <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE> option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links_to_tables">5.6.1.2  Using Symbolic Links for Tables</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1533"></A>

</P>
<P>
In some cases, MySQL silently changes a column specification from
that given in a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  (This may also occur with
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns with a length less than four are changed to
<CODE>CHAR</CODE>.

<LI>

If any column in a table has a variable length, the entire row is
variable-length as a result.  Therefore, if a table contains any
variable-length columns (<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>),
all <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns longer than three characters are changed to
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.  This doesn't affect how you use the columns in
any way; in MySQL, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> is just a different way to
store characters.  MySQL performs this conversion because it
saves space and makes table operations faster.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

From version 4.1.0, if a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> field with a
length specification greater than 255 is converted to <CODE>TEXT</CODE>.
This is a compatibility feature.

<LI>

<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> display sizes must be even and in the range from 2 to 14.
If you specify a display size of 0 or greater than 14, the size is coerced
to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to 13 are coerced
to the next higher even number.

<LI>

You cannot store a literal <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column; setting
it to <CODE>NULL</CODE> sets it to the current date and time.  Because
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns behave this way, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> and <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>
attributes do not apply in the normal way and are ignored if you specify
them.  <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> always reports that a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column may be assigned <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.

<LI>

MySQL maps certain column types used by other SQL database vendors
to MySQL types.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Other-vendor_column_types">6.2.5  Using Column Types from Other Database Engines</A>.
</UL>

<P>
If you want to see whether MySQL used a column type other
than the one you specified, issue a <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> statement after
creating or altering your table.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1534"></A>
Certain other column type changes may occur if you compress a table

<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> allows you to change the structure of an existing table.
For example, you can add or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change
the type of existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself.  You can
also change the comment for the table and type of the table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to change a column specification but
<CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> indicates that your column was not changed, it is
possible that MySQL ignored your modification for one of the reasons
described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.  For example, if you try to change
a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, MySQL will still use
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> if the table contains other variable-length columns.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works by making a temporary copy of the original table.
The alteration is performed on the copy, then the original table is
deleted and the new one is renamed. This is done in such a way that
all updates are automatically redirected to the new table without
any failed updates. While <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> is executing, the original
table is readable by other clients. Updates and writes to the table
are stalled until the new table is ready.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you use any other option to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> than
<CODE>RENAME</CODE>, MySQL will always create a temporary table, even
if the data wouldn't strictly need to be copied (like when you change the
name of a column). We plan to fix this in the future, but as one doesn't
normally do <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> that often this isn't that high on our TODO.
For MyISAM tables, you can speed up the index recreation part (which is the
slowest part of the recreation process) by setting the
<CODE>myisam_sort_buffer_size</CODE> variable to a high value.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, you need <CODE>ALTER</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
and <CODE>CREATE</CODE> privileges on the table.

<LI>

<CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is a MySQL extension to SQL-92.
It controls how <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works if there are duplicates on
unique keys in the new table.
If <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> isn't specified, the copy is aborted and rolled back.
If <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is specified, then for rows with duplicates on a unique
key, only the first row is used; the others are deleted.

<LI>

You can issue multiple <CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>, and
<CODE>CHANGE</CODE> clauses in a single <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement. This is a
MySQL extension to SQL-92, which allows only one of each clause
per <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE col_name</CODE>, <CODE>DROP col_name</CODE>, and <CODE>DROP
INDEX</CODE> are MySQL extensions to SQL-92.

<LI>

<CODE>MODIFY</CODE> is an Oracle extension to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

The optional word <CODE>COLUMN</CODE> is a pure noise word and can be omitted.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name RENAME TO new_name</CODE> without any other
options, MySQL simply renames the files that correspond to the table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE>.  There is no need to create the temporary table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#RENAME_TABLE">6.5.5  <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>create_definition</CODE> clauses use the same syntax for <CODE>ADD</CODE> and
<CODE>CHANGE</CODE> as for <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.  Note that this syntax includes
the column name, not just the column type.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can rename a column using a <CODE>CHANGE old_col_name create_definition</CODE>
clause.  To do so, specify the old and new column names and the type that
the column currently has.  For example, to rename an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> column
from <CODE>a</CODE> to <CODE>b</CODE>, you can do this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE a b INTEGER;
</PRE>

If you want to change a column's type but not the name, <CODE>CHANGE</CODE>
syntax still requires an old and new column name, even if they are the same.
For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b b BIGINT NOT NULL;
</PRE>

However, as of MySQL Version 3.22.16a, you can also use <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>
to change a column's type without renaming it:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b BIGINT NOT NULL;
</PRE>

<LI>

If you use <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE> to shorten a column for which
an index exists on part of the column (for instance, if you have an index
on the first 10 characters of a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column), you cannot make
the column shorter than the number of characters that are indexed.

<LI>

When you change a column type using <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>,
MySQL tries to convert data to the new type as well as possible.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, you can use <CODE>FIRST</CODE> or
<CODE>ADD ... AFTER col_name</CODE> to add a column at a specific position
within a table row. The default is to add the column last.
From MySQL Version 4.0.1, you can also use the <CODE>FIRST</CODE> and
<CODE>AFTER</CODE> keywords in <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>ALTER COLUMN</CODE> specifies a new default value for a column
or removes the old default value.
If the old default is removed and the column can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the new
default is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If the column cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, MySQL
assigns a default value, as described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1543"></A>

<CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> removes an index. This is a MySQL extension to
SQL-92. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DROP_INDEX">6.5.8  <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If columns are dropped from a table, the columns are also removed from any
index of which they are a part.  If all columns that make up an index are
dropped, the index is dropped as well.

<LI>

If a table contains only one column, the column cannot be dropped.
If what you intend is to remove the table, use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> instead.

<A NAME="IDX1546"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1547"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1548"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP PRIMARY KEY</CODE> drops the primary index. If no such
index exists, it drops the first <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index in the table.
(MySQL marks the first <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key as the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>
if no <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> was specified explicitly.)

<A NAME="IDX1549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1550"></A>
If you add a <CODE>UNIQUE INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> to a table, this
is stored before any not <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index so that MySQL can detect
duplicate keys as early as possible.

<A NAME="IDX1551"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> allows you to create the new table with the rows in a
specific order.  Note that the table will not remain in this order after
inserts and deletes.  In some cases, it may make sorting easier for
MySQL if the table is in order by the column that you wish to
order it by later.  This option is mainly useful when you know that you
are mostly going to query the rows in a certain order; by using this
option after big changes to the table, you may be able to get higher
performance.

<A NAME="IDX1552"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1553"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1554"></A>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, all non-unique
indexes are created in a separate batch (like in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>).
This should make <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> much faster when you have many indexes.

<LI>

Since <STRONG>MySQL 4.0</STRONG> the above feature can be activated explicitly.
<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE KEYS</CODE> makes MySQL to stop updating
non-unique indexes for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS</CODE> then should be used to recreate missing
indexes. As MySQL does it with a special algorithm which is much
faster then inserting keys one by one, disabling keys could give a
considerable speedup on bulk inserts.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1555"></A>
With the C API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>, you can find out how many
records were copied, and (when <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is used) how many records were
deleted due to duplication of unique key values.

<A NAME="IDX1556"></A>

The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>, <CODE>CHECK</CODE>, and <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> clauses don't

See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints">7.5.5.2  <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> Constraints</A>.
The syntax for other table types is provided only for compatibility,

<P>
To change column <CODE>a</CODE> from <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> to <CODE>TINYINT NOT NULL</CODE>
(leaving the name the same), and to change column <CODE>b</CODE> from
<CODE>CHAR(10)</CODE> to <CODE>CHAR(20)</CODE> as well as renaming it from <CODE>b</CODE> to
<CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 MODIFY a TINYINT NOT NULL, CHANGE b c CHAR(20);
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column named <CODE>d</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD d TIMESTAMP;
</PRE>

<P>
To add an index on column <CODE>d</CODE>, and make column <CODE>a</CODE> the primary key:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD INDEX (d), ADD PRIMARY KEY (a);
</PRE>

<P>
To remove column <CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c;
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> integer column named <CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD c INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
           ADD INDEX (c);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that we indexed <CODE>c</CODE>, because <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns must be
indexed, and also that we declare <CODE>c</CODE> as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, because
indexed columns cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you add an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, column values are filled in
with sequence numbers for you automatically.  You can set the first
sequence number by executing <CODE>SET INSERT_ID=#</CODE> before
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or using the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT = #</CODE> table option.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
With MyISAM tables, if you don't change the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column, the sequence number will not be affected. If you drop an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column and then add another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column, the numbers will start from 1 again.

Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table itself
is created with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> allows you to add indexes to existing tables.

</P>
<P>
A column list of the form <CODE>(col1,col2,...)</CODE> creates a multiple-column
index.  Index values are formed by concatenating the values of the given
columns.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, indexes can be created that
use only part of a column, using <CODE>col_name(length)</CODE> syntax to index the
first <CODE>length</CODE> bytes of each column value.  (For
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, a prefix length is required;
<CODE>length</CODE> may be a value up to 255.) The
statement shown here creates an index using the first 10 characters of
the <CODE>name</CODE> column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10));
</PRE>

<P>
Because most names usually differ in the first 10 characters, this index should
not be much slower than an index created from the entire <CODE>name</CODE> column.
Also, using partial columns for indexes can make the index file much smaller,
which could save a lot of disk space and might also speed up <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations!

</P>
<P>
Note that you can add an index on a column that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values only if you are using MySQL Version 3.23.2 or newer and are using the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, or <CODE>BDB</CODE> table type.
You can only add an index on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column if you are using
MySQL Version 3.23.2 or newer and are using the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or <CODE>BDB</CODE>
table type, or MySQL Version 4.0.14 or newer and the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table type.
For an index on a<CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column, a prefix length must always
be specified.

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>index_col_name</CODE> specification may end with <CODE>ASC</CODE> or <CODE>DESC</CODE>.
These keywords are allowed for future extensions for specifying ascending
or descending index value storage.  Currently they are parsed but ignored;
index values are always stored in ascending order.

</P>

For more information about how MySQL uses indexes, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes can index only <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, and only in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes
are available in MySQL Version 3.23.23 and later.

The <CODE>USE db_name</CODE> statement tells MySQL to use the <CODE>db_name</CODE>
database as the default database for subsequent queries.  The database remains
current until the end of the session or until another <CODE>USE</CODE> statement
is issued:

Making a particular database current by means of the <CODE>USE</CODE> statement
does not preclude you from accessing tables in other databases.  The following example
accesses the <CODE>author</CODE> table from the <CODE>db1</CODE> database and the

By default, MySQL runs in autocommit mode. This means that
as soon as you execute a statement that updates (modifies) a table,
MySQL will store the update on disk.

</P>
<P>
If you are using transaction-safe tables (like <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> or <CODE>BDB</CODE>),
you can put MySQL into non-autocommit mode with the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0
</PRE>

<P>
After disabling autocommit mode by setting the <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> variable to
zero, you must use <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> to store your changes to disk or
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> if you want to ignore the changes you have made since
the beginning of your transaction.

</P>
<P>
If you want to disable autocommit mode for a single series of
statements, you can use the <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> statement:
:

</P>

<PRE>
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
UPDATE table2 SET summmary=@A WHERE type=1;
COMMIT;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>BEGIN</CODE> and <CODE>BEGIN WORK</CODE> can be used instead of 
<CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> to initiate a transaction.
<CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> was added to MySQL 4.0.11;  it is SQL-99 syntax and
is the recommended way to start an ad-hoc transaction.  <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> and
<CODE>BEGIN WORK</CODE> are available from MySQL 3.23.17 and 3.23.19, respectively.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are not using transaction-safe tables, any changes will be
stored at once, regardless of the status of autocommit mode.

</P>
<P>
If you issue a <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement after updating a non-transactional
table, you will get an error (<CODE>ER_WARNING_NOT_COMPLETE_ROLLBACK</CODE>) as
a warning.  All transaction-safe tables will be restored but any
non-transaction-safe table will not change.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> or <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE>, you
should use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the
older update log.  Transactions are stored in the binary log
in one chunk, upon <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, to ensure that transactions that are
rolled back are not stored.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can change the isolation level for transactions with
<CODE>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_TRANSACTION">6.7.6  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Cannot_roll_back" HREF="manual_toc.html#Cannot_roll_back">6.7.2  Statements That Cannot Be Rolled Back</A></H3>

<P>
Some statements cannot be rolled back.  In general, these will include data
definition language (DDL) statements, such as those that create or drop
databases, or those that create, drop, or alter tables.

</P>
<P>
You may wish to design your transactions not to include such statements.
If you issue a statement that cannot be rolled back early in a transaction,
and then another statement later fails, the full effect of the transaction
cannot be rolled back by issuing a <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement.

locked.  Prior to MySQL 4.0.13, <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> ends a transaction if
the binary update log is enabled.

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.14 and 4.1.1, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> supports the SQL commands
<CODE>SAVEPOINT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
SAVEPOINT identifier
</PRE>

<P>
This statement sets a named transaction savepoint whose name is
<CODE>identifier</CODE>.  If the current transaction already has a
savepoint with the same name, the old savepoint is deleted and a
new one is set.

</P>

<PRE>
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT identifier
</PRE>

<P>
This statement rolls back a transaction to the named savepoint.
Modifications that this transaction made to rows after the savepoint
was set are undone in the rollback, but <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> does <STRONG>not</STRONG>
release the row locks that were stored in memory after the savepoint.
(Note that for a new inserted row, the lock information is carried by
the transaction ID stored in the row; the lock is not separately
stored in memory. In this case, the row lock is released in the undo.)
Savepoints that were set at a later time than the named savepoint are
deleted.

</P>
<P>
If the command returns the following error, it means that
no savepoint with the specified name  exists:

</P>

<PRE>
ERROR 1181: Got error 153 during ROLLBACK

All savepoints of the current transaction are deleted if you execute a

<A NAME="IDX1583"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ [LOCAL] | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE}
            [, tbl_name [AS alias] {READ [LOCAL] | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE} ...]
...
UNLOCK TABLES
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> locks tables for the current thread.  <CODE>UNLOCK
TABLES</CODE> releases any locks held by the current thread.  All tables that
are locked by the current thread are implicitly unlocked when the
thread issues another <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, or when the connection to the
server is closed.

</P>
<P>
To use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in MySQL 4.0.2 you need the global
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> privilege and a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege on the
involved tables. In MySQL 3.23 you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
<CODE>insert</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> privileges for the
tables.

</P>
<P>
The main reasons to use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> are for emulating transactions
or getting more speed when updating tables.  This is explained in more
detail later.

</P>
<P>
If a thread obtains a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock on a table, that thread (and all other
threads) can only read from the table. If a thread obtains a <CODE>WRITE</CODE>
lock on a table, then only the thread holding the lock can read from
or write to the table.  Other threads are blocked.

</P>
<P>
The difference between <CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> and <CODE>READ</CODE> is that
<CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> allows non-conflicting <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to
execute while the lock is held.  This can't however be used if you are
going to manipulate the database files outside MySQL while you
hold the lock.

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, you must lock all tables that you are
going to use and you must use the same alias that you are going to use
in your queries!  If you are using a table multiple times in a query
(with aliases), you must get a lock for each alias!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks normally have higher priority than <CODE>READ</CODE> locks, to
ensure that updates are processed as soon as possible. This means that if one
thread obtains a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock and then another thread requests a
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock, subsequent <CODE>READ</CODE> lock requests will wait until the
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> thread has gotten the lock and released it.  You can use
<CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> locks to allow other threads to obtain <CODE>READ</CODE>
locks while the thread is waiting for the <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock. You should only
use <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> locks if you are sure that there will
eventually be a time when no threads will have a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> works as follows:

<OL>
<LI>

Sort all tables to be locked in a internally defined order (from the
user standpoint the order is undefined).
<LI>

If a table is locked with a read and a write lock, put the write lock
before the read lock.
<LI>

Lock one table at a time until the thread gets all locks.
</OL>

<P>
This policy ensures that table locking is deadlock free. There is
however other things one needs to be aware of with this schema:

</P>
<P>
If you are using a <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> lock for a table, this
means only that MySQL will wait for this particlar lock until
there is no threads that wants a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock.  When the thread has
got the <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock and is waiting to get the lock for the next
table in the lock table list, all other threads will wait for the
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock to be released.  If this becomes a serious problem
with your application, you should consider converting some of your
tables to transaction safe tables.

</P>
<P>
You can safely kill a thread that is waiting for a table lock with
<CODE>KILL</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#KILL">4.5.6  <CODE>KILL</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that you should <STRONG>not</STRONG> lock any tables that you are using with
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  This is because that in this case the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
is done by a separate thread.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you don't have to lock tables, as all single <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements
are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any other currently executing
SQL statement. There are a few cases when you would like to lock tables
anyway:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are going to run many operations on a bunch of tables, it's much
faster to lock the tables you are going to use.  The downside is, of course,
that no thread can update a <CODE>READ</CODE>-locked table (including the one
holding the lock) and no thread can read a <CODE>WRITE</CODE>-locked table other
than the one holding the lock.

The reason some things are faster under <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> is that
MySQL will not flush the key cache for the locked tables until
<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> is called (normally the key cache is flushed after
each SQL statement). This speeds up inserting/updateing/deletes on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

If you are using a storage engine in MySQL that doesn't support
transactions, you must use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> if you want to ensure that
no other thread comes between a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>. The
example shown here requires <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in order to execute safely:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
mysql&#62; SELECT SUM(value) FROM trans WHERE customer_id=some_id;
mysql&#62; UPDATE customer SET total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
    -&#62;        WHERE customer_id=some_id;
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

Without <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, there is a chance that another thread might
insert a new row in the <CODE>trans</CODE> table between execution of the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.
</UL>

<P>
By using incremental updates (<CODE>UPDATE customer SET
value=value+new_value</CODE>) or the <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function, you can
avoid using <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in many cases.

</P>
<P>
You can also solve some cases by using the user-level lock functions
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> and <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>.  These locks are saved in a hash
table in the server and implemented with <CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> and
<CODE>pthread_mutex_unlock()</CODE> for high speed.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Internal_locking">5.3.1  How MySQL Locks Tables</A>, for more information on locking policy.

</P>
<P>
You can lock all tables in all databases with read locks with the
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>. This is very
convenient way to get backups if you have a filesystem, like Veritas,
that can take snapshots in time.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> is not transaction-safe and will
implicitly commit any active transactions before attempting to lock the
tables.

<P>
Sets the transaction isolation level for the global, whole session or
the next transaction.

</P>
<P>
The default behaviour is to set the isolation level for the next (not
started) transaction.  If you use the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> keyword, the statement
sets the default transaction level globally for all new connections
created from that point on (but not existing connections).
You need the <CODE>SUPER</CODE>

default transaction level for all future transactions performed on the

As of Version 3.23.23, MySQL has support for full-text indexing
and searching.  Full-text indexes in MySQL are an index of type
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>.  <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes are used with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables
only and can be created from <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns at <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> time or added later with
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>.  For large datasets, it will be
much faster to load your data into a table that has no <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>
index, then create the index with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> (or <CODE>CREATE

<P>
The <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function performs a natural language search for a string
against a text collection (a set of one or more columns included in
a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index).  The search string is given as the argument to
<CODE>AGAINST()</CODE>.  The search is performed in case-insensitive fashion.
For every row in the table, <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> returns a relevance value,
that is, a similarity measure between the search string and the text in
that row in the columns named in the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> list.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> is used in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause (see example above)
the rows returned are automatically sorted with highest relevance first.
Relevance values are non-negative floating-point numbers.  Zero relevance
means no similarity.  Relevance is computed based on the number of words
in the row, the number of unique words in that row, the total number of
words in the collection, and the number of documents (rows) that contain
a particular word.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to perform a boolean mode search.  This is explained
later in the section.

</P>
<P>
The preceding example is a basic illustration showing how to use the
<CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function. Rows are returned in order of decreasing
relevance.

</P>
<P>
The next example shows how to retrieve the relevance values explicitly.
As neither <CODE>WHERE</CODE> nor <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses are present, returned
rows are not ordered.

</P>

<P>
The following example is more complex.  The query returns the relevance
and still sorts the rows in order of decreasing relevance. To achieve
this result, you should specify <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> twice. This will cause no
additional overhead, because the MySQL optimiser will notice that the
two <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> calls are identical and invoke the full-text search
code only once.

<P>
MySQL uses a very simple parser to split text into words.  A ``word''
is any sequence of characters consisting of letters, digits, <SAMP>`''</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  Any ``word'' that is present in the stopword list or is just
too short is ignored.  The default minimum length of words that will be found
by full-text searches is four characters. This can be changed as described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Fine-tuning">6.8.2  Fine-tuning MySQL Full-text Search</A>.

</P>
<P>
Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted
according to its significance in the query or collection.  This way, a
word that is present in many documents will have lower weight (and may
even have a zero weight), because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection.  Otherwise, if the word is rare, it will receive a
higher weight.  The weights of the words are then combined to compute the
relevance of the row.

</P>
<P>
Such a technique works best with large collections (in fact, it was
carefully tuned this way).  For very small tables, word distribution
does not reflect adequately their semantic value, and this model
may sometimes produce bizarre results.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('MySQL');
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The search for the word <CODE>MySQL</CODE> produces no results in the above
example, because that word is present in more than half the rows.  As such,
it is effectively treated as a stopword (that is, a word with zero semantic
value).  This is the most desirable behaviour -- a natural language query
should not return every second row from a 1 GB table.

</P>
<P>
A word that matches half of rows in a table is less likely to locate relevant
documents.  In fact, it will most likely find plenty of irrelevant documents.
We all know this happens far too often when we are trying to find something on
the Internet with a search engine.  It is with this reasoning that such rows
have been assigned a low semantic value in <STRONG>this particular dataset</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
As of Version 4.0.1, MySQL can also perform boolean full-text searches using
the <CODE>IN BOOLEAN MODE</CODE> modifier.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body)

<P>
This query retrieved all the rows that contain the word <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
(note: the 50% threshold is not used), but that do <STRONG>not</STRONG> contain
the word <CODE>YourSQL</CODE>.  Note that a boolean mode search does not
automatically sort rows in order of decreasing relevance.  You can
see this from result of the preceding query, where the row with the
highest relevance (the one that contains <CODE>MySQL</CODE> twice) is listed
last, not first.  A boolean full-text search can also work even without
a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index, although it would be <STRONG>slow</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>+</CODE>
<DD>
A leading plus sign indicates that this word <STRONG>must be</STRONG>
present in every row returned.
<DT><CODE>-</CODE>
<DD>
A leading minus sign indicates that this word <STRONG>must not be</STRONG>
present in any row returned.
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>
By default (when neither plus nor minus is specified) the word is optional,
but the rows that contain it will be rated higher. This mimicks the
behaviour of <CODE>MATCH() ... AGAINST()</CODE> without the <CODE>IN BOOLEAN
MODE</CODE> modifier.
<DT><CODE>&#60; &#62;</CODE>
<DD>
These two operators are used to change a word's contribution to the
relevance value that is assigned to a row.  The <CODE>&#60;</CODE> operator
decreases the contribution and the <CODE>&#62;</CODE> operator increases it.
See the example below.
<DT><CODE>( )</CODE>
<DD>
Parentheses are used to group words into subexpressions.
<DT><CODE>~</CODE>
<DD>
A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's
contribution to the row relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking
noise words. A row that contains such a word will be rated lower than
others, but will not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the
<CODE>-</CODE> operator.
<DT><CODE>*</CODE>
<DD>
An asterisk is the truncation operator. Unlike the other operators, it
should be <STRONG>appended</STRONG> to the word, not prepended.
<DT><CODE>"</CODE>
<DD>
The phrase, that is enclosed in double quotes <CODE>"</CODE>, matches only
rows that contain this phrase <STRONG>literally, as it was typed</STRONG>.
</DL>

<P>
And here are some examples:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>apple banana</CODE>
<DD>
find rows that contain at least one of these words.
<DT><CODE>+apple +juice</CODE>
<DD>
... both words.
<DT><CODE>+apple macintosh</CODE>
<DD>
... word ``apple'', but rank it higher if it also contain ``macintosh''.
<DT><CODE>+apple -macintosh</CODE>
<DD>
... word ``apple'' but not ``macintosh''.
<DT><CODE>+apple +(&#62;turnover &#60;strudel)</CODE>
<DD>
... ``apple'' and ``turnover'', or ``apple'' and ``strudel'' (in any
order), but rank ``apple pie'' higher than ``apple strudel''.
<DT><CODE>apple*</CODE>

<H3><A NAME="Fulltext_Fine-tuning" HREF="manual_toc.html#Fulltext_Fine-tuning">6.8.2  Fine-tuning MySQL Full-text Search</A></H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, full-text search has few user-tunable parameters yet,
although adding some is very high on the TODO. If you have a
MySQL source distribution (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>), you can
exert more control over full-text searching behaviour.

</P>
<P>
Note that full-text search was carefully tuned for the best searching
effectiveness.  Modifying the default behaviour will, in most cases,
only make the search results worse.  Do not alter the MySQL sources
unless you know what you are doing!

</P>
<P>
The full-text variables described in the following list must be set
at server startup time. You cannot modify them dynamically while the
server is running.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The minimum length of words to be indexed is defined by the MySQL
variable <CODE>ft_min_word_len</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
(This variable is only available from MySQL version 4.0.)
The default value is four characters.
Change it to the value you prefer, and rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes.
For example, if you want three-character words to be searchable, you can set
this variable by putting the following lines in an option file:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=3
</PRE>

Then restart the server and rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes.

<LI>

The stopword list can be loaded from the file specified by the
<CODE>ft_stopword_file</CODE> variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
Rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes after modifying the stopword list.
(This variable is only available from MySQL version 4.0.10 and onwards)

<LI>

The 50% threshold is determined by the particular weighting scheme chosen.
To disable it, change the following line in <TT>`myisam/ftdefs.h'</TT>:

<PRE>
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_PROB
</PRE>

To:

<PRE>
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_FREQ
</PRE>

Then recompile MySQL.
There is no need to rebuild the indexes in this case.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: by doing this you <STRONG>severely</STRONG> decrease MySQL's ability
to provide adequate relevance values for the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function.
If you really need to search for such common words, it would be better to
search using <CODE>IN BOOLEAN MODE</CODE> instead, which does not observe the 50%
threshold.

<LI>

Sometimes the search engine maintainer would like to change the operators used
for boolean full-text searches. These are defined by the
<CODE>ft_boolean_syntax</CODE> variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
Still, this variable is read-only; its value is set in
<TT>`myisam/ft_static.c'</TT>.

</UL>

<P>
For full-text changes that require you to rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes,
the easiest way to do so for a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table is to use the following
statement, which rebuilds the index file:

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1589"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1590"></A>

</P>
<P>
From version 4.0.1, <CODE>MySQL server</CODE> features a <CODE>Query Cache</CODE>.
When in use, the query cache stores the text of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query
together with the corresponding result that was sent to the client.
If an identical query is later received, the server will retrieve
the results from the query cache rather than parsing and executing the
same query again.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The query cache does not return stale data. When data
is modified, any relevant entries in the query cache are flushed.

</P>
<P>
The query cache is extremely useful in an environment where (some)
tables don't change very often and you have a lot of identical queries.
This is a typical situation for many web servers that use a lot of
dynamic content.

</P>
<P>
Below is some performance data for the query cache. (These results were 
generated by running the MySQL benchmark suite on a Linux Alpha
2 x 500 MHz with 2 GB RAM and a 64 MB query cache):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If all of the queries you're performing are simple (such as selecting a
row from a table with one row); but still differ so that the queries can
not be cached, the overhead for having the query cache active is 13%.
This could be regarded as the worst case scenario. However, in real life,
queries are much more complicated than our simple example so the overhead
is normally significantly lower.
<LI>

Searches after one row in a one row table is 238% faster.
This can be regarded as close to the minimum speedup to be expected for
a query that is cached.
<LI>

If you want to disable the query cache code set <CODE>query_cache_size=0</CODE>.
By disabling the query cache code there is no noticeable overhead.
(query cache can be excluded from code with help of configure option
<CODE>--without-query-cache</CODE>)
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Query_Cache_How" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_Cache_How">6.9.1  How the Query Cache Operates</A></H3>

<P>
Queries are compared before parsing, thus

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
and

</P>

<PRE>
Select * from tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
are regarded as different queries for query cache, so queries need
to be exactly the same (byte for byte) to be seen as identical.
In addition, a query may be seen as different if for instance one
client is using a new communication protocol format or another
character set than another client.

</P>
<P>
Queries that uses different databases, uses different protocol versions
or the uses different default character sets are considered different
queries and cached separately.

</P>
<P>
The cache does work for <CODE>SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ...</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT FOUND_ROWS() ...</CODE> type queries because the number of
found rows is also stored in the cache.

</P>
<P>
If query result was returned from query cache then status variable
<CODE>Com_select</CODE> will not be increased, but <CODE>Qcache_hits</CODE> will be. 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache_Status_and_Maintenance">6.9.4  Query Cache Status and Maintenance</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a table changes (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER</CODE> or <CODE>DROP TABLE|DATABASE</CODE>),
then all cached queries that used this table (possibly through a
<CODE>MRG_MyISAM</CODE> table!) become invalid and are removed from the cache.

</P>
<P>
Transactional <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables that have been changed will be invalidated
when a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> is performed.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0, the query cache is disabled inside of transactions (it does
not return results). Beginning with MySQL 4.1.1, the query cache will also
work inside of transactions when using <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables (it will use the
table version number to detect if the data is still current or not).

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 5.0, a query that begins with a leading comment might be cached,
but could not be fetched from the cache. This problem is fixed in MySQL 5.0.

</P>
<P>
A query cannot be cached if it contains one of the functions:

</P>
<P>
Nor can a query be cached if it contains user variables,
references the mysql system database,
is of the form <CODE>SELECT ... IN SHARE MODE</CODE>,
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE ...</CODE>,
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE ...</CODE> or
of the form <CODE>SELECT * FROM AUTOINCREMENT_FIELD IS NULL</CODE>
(to retrieve last insert ID - ODBC work around).

</P>
<P>
However, <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> will return the correct value,
even if the preceding query was fetched from the cache.

</P>
<P>
In case a query does not use any tables, or uses temporary tables,
or if the user has a column privilege for any of the involved tables,
that query will not be cached.

</P>
<P>
Before a query is fetched from the query cache, MySQL will check that
the user has SELECT privilege to all the involved databases and
tables. If this is not the case, the cached result will not be used.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Query_Cache_Configuration" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_Cache_Configuration">6.9.2  Query Cache Configuration</A></H3>

<P>
The query cache adds a few <CODE>MySQL</CODE> system variables for
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> which may be set in a configuration file, on the
command-line when starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>query_cache_limit</CODE>

Don't cache results that are bigger than this. (Default 1M).

<LI><CODE>query_cache_min_res_unit</CODE>

This variable is present from version 4.1.

The result of a query (the data that is also sent to the client) is stored
in the query cache during result retrieval. Therefore the data is usually
not handled in one big chunk. The query cache allocates blocks for storing
this data on demand, so when one block is filled, a new block is allocated.
Because memory allocation operation is costly (time wise), the query cache
allocates blocks with a minimum size of <CODE>query_cache_min_res_unit</CODE>.
When a query is executed, the last result block is trimmed to the actual
data size, so that unused memory is freed.

<UL>
<LI>

The default value of <CODE>query_cache_min_res_unit</CODE> is 4 KB which should
be adequate for most cases.
<LI>

If you have a lot of queries with small results, the default block size may
lead to memory fragmentation (indicated by a large number of free blocks
(<CODE>Qcache_free_blocks</CODE>), which can cause the query cache to have to
delete queries from the cache due to lack of memory
(<CODE>Qcache_lowmem_prunes</CODE>)). In this case you should decrease
<CODE>query_cache_min_res_unit</CODE>.
<LI>

If you mostly have queres with big results (see <CODE>Qcache_total_blocks</CODE>
and <CODE>Qcache_queries_in_cache</CODE>), you can increase performance by
increasing <CODE>query_cache_min_res_unit</CODE>. However, be careful to not
make it to large (see the previous point).
</UL>

<LI><CODE>query_cache_size</CODE>

The amount of memory (specified in bytes) allocated to store results from
old queries. If this is 0, the query cache is disabled (default).

Total number of queries =

</P>
<P>
The query cache uses variable length blocks, so <CODE>Qcache_total_blocks</CODE>
and <CODE>Qcache_free_blocks</CODE> may indicate query cache memory fragmentation.
After <CODE>FLUSH QUERY CACHE</CODE> only a single (big) free block remains.

</P>
<P>
Note: Every query needs a minimum of two blocks (one for the query text
and one or more for the query results). Also, every table that is used
by a query needs one block, but if two or more queries use same table
only one block needs to be allocated.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>Qcache_lowmem_prunes</CODE> status variable to tune the query
cache size. It counts the number of queries that have been removed from the
cache to free up memory for caching new queries. The query cache uses a
<CODE>least recently used</CODE> (<CODE>LRU</CODE>) strategy to decide which queries to
remove from the cache.

<P>
As of MySQL Version 3.23.6, you can choose between three basic
table formats (<CODE>ISAM</CODE>, <CODE>HEAP</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>).  Newer
versions of MySQL support additional table types (<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>,
or <CODE>BDB</CODE>), depending on how you compile it. A database may contain
tables of different types.

</P>
<P>
When you create a new table, you can tell MySQL what type of table to create.
The default table type is usually <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.

</P>

<P>
MySQL will always create a <TT>`.frm'</TT> file to hold the table and column
definitions. The table's index and data will be stored in one or more other
files, depending on the table type.

</P>
<P>
If you try to use a table type that is not compiled-in or activated,
MySQL will instead create a table of type <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  This behaviour
is convenient when you want to copy tables between MySQL servers that
support different table types. (Perhaps your master server supports
transactional storage engines for increased safety, while the slave servers use
only non-transactional storage engines for greater speed.)

</P>
<P>
This automatic change of table types can be confusing for new MySQL users.  We
plan to fix this by introducing warnings in the new client/server protocol in
version 4.1 and generating a warning when a table type is automatically changed.

</P>
<P>
You can convert tables between different types with the <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL supports two different kinds of
tables: transaction-safe tables (<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE>)
and not transaction-safe tables (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>, <CODE>ISAM</CODE>,
<CODE>MERGE</CODE>, and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Advantages of transaction-safe tables (TST):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Safer. Even if MySQL crashes or you get hardware problems, you
can get your data back, either by automatic recovery or from a backup
+ the transaction log.
<LI>

You can combine many statements and accept these all in one go with
the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> command.
<LI>

You can execute <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> to ignore your changes (if you are not
running in auto-commit mode).
<LI>

If an update fails, all your changes will be restored. (With NTST tables all
changes that have taken place are permanent)
<LI>

Can provide better concurrency if the table gets many updates concurrently
with reads.
</UL>

<P>
Note that to use <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables you have to use at least the
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> startup option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.3  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
Advantages of not transaction-safe tables (NTST):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Much faster as there is no transaction overhead.
<LI>

Will use less disk space as there is no overhead of transactions.
<LI>

Will use less memory to do updates.
</UL>

<P>
You can combine TST and NTST tables in the same statements to get the best
of both worlds.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="MyISAM" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is the default table type in MySQL Version 3.23. It's
based on the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> code and has a lot of useful extensions.

</P>
<P>
The index is stored in a file with the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> (MYIndex) extension,
and the data is stored in a file with the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> (MYData) extension.
You can check/repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crash_recovery">4.4.6.7  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Crash Recovery</A>. You can compress <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> to take up much less space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following is new in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There is a flag in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> file that indicates whether
the table was closed correctly.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is started with
<CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>, <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables will automatically be
checked and/or repaired on open if the table wasn't closed properly.
<LI>

You can <CODE>INSERT</CODE> new rows in a table that doesn't have free blocks
in the middle of the datafile, at the same time other threads are
reading from the table (concurrent insert).  A free block can come from
an update of a dynamic length row with much data to a row with less data
or when deleting rows. When all free blocks are used up, all future
inserts will be concurrent again.
<LI>

Support for big files (63-bit) on filesystems/operating systems that
support big files.
<LI>

All data is stored with the low byte first. This makes the data machine
and OS independent. The only requirement for binary portability
is that the machine uses
two's-complement signed integers (as every machine for the last 20 years
has) and IEEE floating-point format (also totally dominant among
mainstream machines). The only area of machines that may not support
binary compatibility are embedded systems (because they sometimes have
peculiar processors).

There is no big speed penalty in storing data low byte first; the bytes
in a table row is normally unaligned and it doesn't take that much more
power to read an unaligned byte in order than in reverse order.  The
actual fetch-column-value code is also not time critical compared to
other code.
<LI>

All number keys are stored with high byte first to give better index
compression.
<LI>

Internal handling of one <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column. <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
will automatically update this on <CODE>INSERT/UPDATE</CODE>. The
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value can be reset with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. This
will make <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns faster (at least 10%) and old
numbers will not be reused as with the old <CODE>ISAM</CODE>. Note that when an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> is defined on the end of a multi-part-key the old
behaviour is still present.
<LI>

When inserted in sorted order (as when you are using an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column) the key tree will be split so that the high node only contains one
key. This will improve the space utilisation in the key tree.
<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns can be indexed.
<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values are allowed in indexed columns.  This takes 0-1
bytes/key.
<LI>

Maximum key length is 500 bytes by default (can be changed by
recompiling).  In cases of keys longer than 250 bytes, a bigger key
block size than the default of 1024 bytes is used for this key.
<LI>

Maximum number of keys/table is 32 as default. This can be enlarged to 64
without having to recompile <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will mark tables as checked if one runs it with
<CODE>--update-state</CODE>. <CODE>myisamchk --fast</CODE> will only check those
tables that don't have this mark.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE> stores statistics for key parts (and not only for
whole keys as in <CODE>ISAM</CODE>).
<LI>

Dynamic size rows will now be much less fragmented when mixing deletes
with updates and inserts.  This is done by automatically combining adjacent
deleted blocks and by extending blocks if the next block is deleted.
<LI>

<CODE>myisampack</CODE> can pack <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.
<LI>

You can use put the datafile and index file on different directories
to get more speed (with the <CODE>DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY="path"</CODE> option to
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>). See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> also supports the following things, which MySQL
will be able to use in the near future:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Support for a true <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> type; a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column starts
with a length stored in 2 bytes.
<LI>

Tables with <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> may have fixed or dynamic record length.
<LI>

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> may be up to 64K.
All key segments have their own language definition. This will enable
MySQL to have different language definitions per column.
<LI>

A hashed computed index can be used for <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>. This will allow
you to have <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> on any combination of columns in a table. (You
can't search on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> computed index, however.)
</UL>

<P>
Note that index files are usually much smaller with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> than with
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>. This means that <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will normally use less
system resources than <CODE>ISAM</CODE>, but will need more CPU time when inserting
data into a compressed index.

</P>
<P>
The following options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be used to change the behaviour of
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

<P>
The automatic recovery is activated if you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--myisam-recover=#</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.
On open, the table is checked if it's marked as crashed or if the open
count variable for the table is not 0 and you are running with
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>.  If either of the above is true the following
happens.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The table is checked for errors.
<LI>

If we found an error, try to do a fast repair (with sorting and without
re-creating the datafile) of the table.
<LI>

If the repair fails because of an error in the datafile (for example a
duplicate key error), we try again, but this time we re-create the datafile.
<LI>

If the repair fails, retry once more with the old repair option method
(write row by row without sorting) which should be able to repair any
type of error with little disk requirements..
</UL>

<P>
If the recover wouldn't be able to recover all rows from a previous
completed statement and you didn't specify <CODE>FORCE</CODE> as an option to
<CODE>myisam-recover</CODE>, then the automatic repair will abort with an error
message in the error file:

<P>
Note that if you run automatic recover with the <CODE>BACKUP</CODE> option,

<H3><A NAME="Key_space" HREF="manual_toc.html#Key_space">7.1.1  Space Needed for Keys</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1603"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL can support different index types, but the normal type is
ISAM or MyISAM.  These use a B-tree index, and you can roughly calculate
the size for the index file as <CODE>(key_length+4)/0.67</CODE>, summed over
all keys.  (This is for the worst case when all keys are inserted in
sorted order and we don't have any compressed keys.)

</P>
<P>
String indexes are space compressed. If the first index part is a
string, it will also be prefix compressed.  Space compression makes the
index file smaller than the above figures if the string column has a lot
of trailing space or is a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column that is not always used
to the full length. Prefix compression is used on keys that start
with a string.  Prefix compression helps if there are many strings
with an identical prefix.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, you can also prefix compress numbers by specifying
<CODE>PACK_KEYS=1</CODE> when you create the table.  This helps when you have
many integer keys that have an identical prefix when the numbers are stored
high-byte first.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="MyISAM_table_formats" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Formats</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> supports 3 different table types. Two of them are chosen
automatically depending on the type of columns you are using. The third,
compressed tables, can only be created with the <CODE>myisampack</CODE> tool.

</P>
<P>
When you <CODE>CREATE</CODE> or <CODE>ALTER</CODE> a table you can for tables that
doesn't have <CODE>BLOB</CODE>s force the table format to <CODE>DYNAMIC</CODE> or
<CODE>FIXED</CODE> with the <CODE>ROW_FORMAT=#</CODE> table option.  In the future
you will be able to compress/decompress tables by specifying
<CODE>ROW_FORMAT=compressed | default</CODE> to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Static_format" HREF="manual_toc.html#Static_format">7.1.2.1  Static (Fixed-length) Table Characteristics</A></H4>

<P>
This is the default format. It's used when the table contains no
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
This format is the simplest and most secure format. It is also the
fastest of the on-disk formats. The speed comes from the easy way data
can be found on disk. When looking up something with an index and static
format it is very simple. Just multiply the row number by the row length.

</P>
<P>
Also, when scanning a table it is very easy to read a constant number of
records with each disk read.

</P>
<P>
The security is evidenced if your computer crashes when writing to a
fixed-size MyISAM file, in which case <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> can easily figure out where each
row starts and ends. So it can usually reclaim all records except the
partially written one. Note that in MySQL all indexes can always be
reconstructed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>, and <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> columns are space-padded
to the column width.
<LI>

Very quick.
<LI>

Easy to cache.
<LI>

Easy to reconstruct after a crash, because records are located in fixed
positions.
<LI>

Doesn't have to be reorganised (with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>) unless a huge number of
records are deleted and you want to return free disk space to the operating
system.
<LI>

Usually requires more disk space than dynamic tables.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Dynamic_format" HREF="manual_toc.html#Dynamic_format">7.1.2.2  Dynamic Table Characteristics</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1604"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1605"></A>

</P>
<P>
This format is used if the table contains any <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>,
or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns or if the table was created with
<CODE>ROW_FORMAT=dynamic</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This format is a little more complex because each row has to have a header
that says how long it is. One record can also end up at more than one
location when it is made longer at an update.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1606"></A>
You can use <CODE>OPTIMIZE table</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to defragment a
table. If you have static data that you access/change a lot in the same
table as some <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns, it might be a good
idea to move the dynamic columns to other tables just to avoid
fragmentation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All string columns are dynamic (except those with a length less than 4).
<LI>

Each record is preceded by a bitmap indicating which columns are empty
(<CODE>''</CODE>) for string columns, or zero for numeric columns. (This isn't
the same as columns containing <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.) If a string column
has a length of zero after removal of trailing spaces, or a numeric
column has a value of zero, it is marked in the bit map and not saved to
disk.  Non-empty strings are saved as a length byte plus the string
contents.
<LI>

Usually takes much less disk space than fixed-length tables.
<LI>

Each record uses only as much space as is required. If a record becomes
larger, it is split into as many pieces as are required.  This results in record
fragmentation.
<LI>

If you update a row with information that extends the row length, the
row will be fragmented.  In this case, you may have to run <CODE>myisamchk
-r</CODE> from time to time to get better performance.  Use <CODE>myisamchk -ei
tbl_name</CODE> for some statistics.
<LI>

Not as easy to reconstruct after a crash, because a record may be fragmented
into many pieces and a link (fragment) may be missing.
<LI>

The expected row length for dynamic sized records is:


<PRE>
3
+ (number of columns + 7) / 8
+ (number of char columns)
+ packed size of numeric columns
+ length of strings
+ (number of NULL columns + 7) / 8
</PRE>

There is a penalty of 6 bytes for each link. A dynamic record is linked
whenever an update causes an enlargement of the record. Each new link will be
at least 20 bytes, so the next enlargement will probably go in the same link.
If not, there will be another link. You may check how many links there are
with <CODE>myisamchk -ed</CODE>. All links may be removed with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.

This is a read-only type that is generated with the optional

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All MySQL distributions, even those that existed before MySQL
went <CODE>GPL</CODE>, can read tables that were compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.
<LI>

Compressed tables take very little disk space. This minimises disk usage, which
is very nice when using slow disks (like CD-ROMs).
<LI>

Each record is compressed separately (very little access overhead).  The
header for a record is fixed (1-3 bytes) depending on the biggest record in the
table.  Each column is compressed differently. Some of the compression types
are:

<UL>
<LI>

There is usually a different Huffman table for each column.
<LI>

Suffix space compression.
<LI>

Prefix space compression.
<LI>

Numbers with value <CODE>0</CODE> are stored using 1 bit.
<LI>

If values in an integer column have a small range, the column is stored using
the smallest possible type. For example, a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column (8 bytes) may
be stored as a <CODE>TINYINT</CODE> column (1 byte) if all values are in the range
<CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>.
<LI>

If a column has only a small set of possible values, the column type is
converted to <CODE>ENUM</CODE>.
<LI>

A column may use a combination of the above compressions.

Even if the MyISAM table format is very reliable (all changes to a table
is written before the SQL statements returns) , you can still get
corrupted tables if some of the following things happens:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process being killed in the middle of a write.
<LI>

Unexpected shutdown of the computer (for example, if the computer is turned
off).
<LI>

A hardware error.
<LI>

You are using an external program (like myisamchk) on a live table.
<LI>

A software bug in the MySQL or MyISAM code.
</UL>

<P>
Typial typical symptoms for a corrupt table is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You get the error <CODE>Incorrect key file for table: '...'. Try to repair it</CODE>
while selecting data from the table.
<LI>

Queries doesn't find rows in the table or returns incomplete data.

<P>
You can repair a corrupted table with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
You can also repair a table, when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not running with
the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command. <CODE>myisamchk syntax</CODE>.

If your tables get corrupted a lot you should try to find the reason for
this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
In this case the most important thing to know is if the table got
corrupted if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died (one can easily verify this by
checking if there is a recent row <CODE>restarted mysqld</CODE> in the mysqld
error file).  If this isn't the case, then you should try to make a test

When the last instance of a table is closed (because of a <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> or
because there isn't room in the table cache) the counter is
decremented if the table has been updated at any point.
<LI>

When you repair the table or check the table and it was okay,
the counter is reset to 0.
<LI>

To avoid problems with interaction with other processes that may do a
check on the table, the counter is not decremented on close if it was 0.
</UL>

<P>
In other words, the only ways this can go out of sync are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are copied without a <CODE>LOCK</CODE> and
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL has crashed between an update and the final close.
(Note that the table may still be okay, as MySQL always issues writes
for everything between each statement.)
<LI>

Someone has done a <CODE>myisamchk --recover</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk
--update-state</CODE>on a table that was in use by <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers are using the table and one has done a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or <CODE>CHECK</CODE> of the table while it was in use by
another server.  In this setup the <CODE>CHECK</CODE> is safe to do (even if
you will get the warning from other servers), but <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> should
be avoided as it currently replaces the datafile with a new one, which
is not signaled to the other servers.

<H2><A NAME="MERGE" HREF="manual_toc.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1611"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1612"></A>
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables are new in MySQL Version 3.23.25. The code
is still in gamma, but should be reasonable stable.

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table (also known as a <CODE>MRG_MyISAM</CODE> table) is a
collection of identical <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables that can be used as one.
You can only <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> from the
collection of tables.  If you <CODE>DROP</CODE> the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you
are only dropping the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> specification.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables. (We plan to fix this in 4.1).

</P>
<P>
With identical tables we mean that all tables are created with identical
column and key information.  You can't merge tables in which the
columns are packed differently, doesn't have exactly the same columns,
or have the keys in different order.  However, some of the tables can be
compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you will get a <TT>`.frm'</TT> table
definition file and a <TT>`.MRG'</TT> table list file.  The <TT>`.MRG'</TT> just
contains a list of the index files (<TT>`.MYI'</TT> files) that should
be used as one.  Before 4.1.1 all used tables had to be in the same
database as the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table itself.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges on the tables you map to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables can help you solve the following problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Easily manage a set of log tables. For example, you can put data from
different months into separate files, compress some of them with
<CODE>myisampack</CODE>, and then create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> to use these as one.
<LI>

Give you more speed. You can split a big read-only table based on some
criteria and then put the different table part on different disks.
A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table on this could be much faster than using
the big table. (You can, of course, also use a RAID to get the same
kind of benefits.)
<LI>

Do more efficient searches. If you know exactly what you are looking
after, you can search in just one of the split tables for some queries
and use a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table for others.  You can even have many
different <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables active, with possible overlapping files.
<LI>

More efficient repairs. It's easier to repair the individual files that
are mapped to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> file than trying to repair a really big file.
<LI>

Instant mapping of many files as one. A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table uses the
index of the individual tables. It doesn't need to maintain an index of
its one.  This makes <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table collections VERY fast to make or
remap.  Note that you must specify the key definitions when you create
a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table!.
<LI>

If you have a set of tables that you join to a big table on demand or
batch, you should instead create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table on them on demand.
This is much faster and will save a lot of disk space.
<LI>

Go around the file-size limit for the operating system.
<LI>

You can create an alias/synonym for a table by just using <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
over one table. There shouldn't be any really notable performance
impacts of doing this (only a couple of indirect calls and <CODE>memcpy()</CODE>
calls for each read).
</UL>

<P>
The disadvantages with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can only use identical <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables for a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
<LI>

<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> doesn't work.
<LI>

<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables uses more file descriptors. If you are using a
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table that maps over 10 tables and 10 users are using this, you
are using 10*10 + 10 file descriptors.  (10 datafiles for 10 users
and 10 shared index files.)
<LI>

Key reads are slower. When you do a read on a key, the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
storage engine will need to issue a read on all underlying tables to check
which one most closely matches the given key.  If you then do a "read-next"
then the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> storage engine will need to search the read buffers
to find the next key. Only when one key buffer is used up, the storage engine
will need to read the next key block. This makes <CODE>MERGE</CODE> keys much slower
on <CODE>eq_ref</CODE> searches, but not much slower on <CODE>ref</CODE> searches.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.
<LI>

You can't do
<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause,
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, or
<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>
on any of the table that is
mapped by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table that is "open".  If you do this, the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table may still refer to the original table and you will
get unexpected results. The easiest way to get around this deficiency
is to issue the <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> command, ensuring no <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
tables remain "open".
</UL>

<P>
When you create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table you have to specify with
<CODE>UNION=(list-of-tables)</CODE> which tables you want to use as
one. Optionally you can specify with <CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> if you want
insert for the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table to happen in the first or last table
in the <CODE>UNION</CODE> list. If you don't specify <CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> or
specify <CODE>NO</CODE>, then all <CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
table will return an error.

</P>
<P>
The following example shows you how to use <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
INSERT INTO t1 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t1");
INSERT INTO t2 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t2");
CREATE TABLE total (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, message CHAR(20), KEY(a))
             TYPE=MERGE UNION=(t1,t2) INSERT_METHOD=LAST;
SELECT * FROM total;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that we didn't create a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in the
<CODE>total</CODE> table as the key isn't going to be unique in the <CODE>total</CODE>
table.

</P>
<P>
Note that you can also manipulate the <TT>`.MRG'</TT> file directly from
the outside of the MySQL server:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /mysql-data-directory/current-database
shell&#62; ls -1 t1.MYI t2.MYI &#62; total.MRG
shell&#62; mysqladmin flush-tables
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can do things like:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM total;
+---+---------+
| a | message |
+---+---------+
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t1      |
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t2      |
+---+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>a</CODE> column, though declared as <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>,
is not really unique, as <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table cannot enforce uniqueness
over a set of underlying <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.

</P>
<P>
To remap a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table you can do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP</CODE> the table and re-create it
<LI>

Use <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name UNION=(...)</CODE>
<LI>

Change the <TT>`.MRG'</TT> file and issue a <CODE>FLUSH TABLE</CODE> on the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and all underlying tables to force the storage engine to
read the new definition file.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="MERGE_table_problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#MERGE_table_problems">7.2.1  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Table Problems</A></H3>

<P>
The following are the known problems with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table cannot maintain <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> constraints over the
whole table.  When you do <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, the data goes into the first or
last table (according to <CODE>INSERT_METHOD=xxx</CODE>) and this <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
table ensures that the data are unique, but it knows nothing about
others <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables.
<LI>

<CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> on a table used in an active <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table may
corrupt the table.  This will be fixed in MySQL 4.1.x.
<LI>

Creation of a table of type <CODE>MERGE</CODE> doesn't check if the underlying
tables are of compatible types or if they exists.  MySQL will do a quick check
if the record length is equal between mapped tables when the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
table is used, but this is not a fullproof check.

If you use <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables in this fashion, you are very likely to
run into strange problems.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to first add an <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index to a
table used in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and then use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
add a normal index on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, the key order will be
different for the tables if there was an old non-unique key in the
table. This is because <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> puts <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys before
normal keys to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
<LI>

<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is in use by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table will
not work on Windows because the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> storage engine does the table
mapping hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't allow
you to drop files that are open, you first must flush all <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
tables (with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>) or drop the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table before
dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we introduce
<CODE>VIEW</CODE>s.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
The deprecated <CODE>ISAM</CODE> table type will disappear in MySQL version 5.0.
In MySQL 4.1 it's included in the source but not compiled anymore.
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is a better implementation of this table handler and you should
convert all <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables to <CODE>MySAM</CODE> tables as soon as possible.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ISAM</CODE> uses a <CODE>B-tree</CODE> index. The index is stored in a file
with the <TT>`.ISM'</TT> extension, and the data is stored in a file with
the <TT>`.ISD'</TT> extension.
You can check/repair <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables with the <CODE>isamchk</CODE> utility.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crash_recovery">4.4.6.7  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ISAM</CODE> has the following features/properties:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Compressed and fixed-length keys

<LI>Fixed and dynamic record length

<LI>16 keys with 16 key parts/key

<LI>Max key length 256 (default)

<LI>Data is stored in machine format; this is fast, but is machine/OS dependent.

</UL>

<P>
Most of the things true for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are also true for <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>. The major differences compared
to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables are not binary portable across OS/Platforms.

<LI>Can't handle tables &#62; 4G.

<LI>Only support prefix compression on strings.

<LI>Smaller key limits.

<LI>Dynamic tables get more fragmented.

<LI>Tables are compressed with <CODE>pack_isam</CODE> rather than with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
If you want to convert an <CODE>ISAM</CODE> table to a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table so
that you can use utilities such as <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>, use an <CODE>ALTER

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use hashed indexes and are stored in memory.  This
makes them very fast, but if MySQL crashes you will lose all
data stored in them.  <CODE>HEAP</CODE> is very useful for temporary tables!

</P>
<P>
The MySQL internal <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use 100% dynamic hashing
without overflow areas. There is no extra space needed for free lists.
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables also don't have problems with delete + inserts, which
normally is common with hashed tables:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test TYPE=HEAP SELECT ip,SUM(downloads) AS down
    -&#62;                   FROM log_table GROUP BY ip;
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(ip),AVG(down) FROM test;
mysql&#62; DROP TABLE test;
</PRE>

<P>
Here are some things you should consider when you use <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You should always use specify <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> in the <CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement
to ensure that you accidentally do not use all memory.
<LI>

Indexes will only be used with <CODE>=</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> (but are VERY fast).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables can only use whole keys to search for a row; compare this
to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables where any prefix of the key can be used to find rows.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use a fixed record length format.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Prior to MySQL 4.0.2, <CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support an index on a <CODE>NULL</CODE>
column.
<LI>

You can have non-unique keys in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table (this isn't common for
hashed tables).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables are shared between all clients (just like any other
table).
<LI>

You can't search for the next entry in order (that is, to use the index
to do an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>).
<LI>

Data for <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables are allocated in small blocks. The tables
are 100% dynamic (on inserting). No overflow areas and no extra key
space are needed.  Deleted rows are put in a linked list and are
reused when you insert new data into the table.
<LI>

You need enough extra memory for all <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables that you want to use at
the same time.
<LI>

To free memory, you should execute <CODE>DELETE FROM heap_table</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE heap_table</CODE> or <CODE>DROP TABLE heap_table</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL cannot find out approximately how many rows there
are between two values (this is used by the range optimiser to decide which
index to use).  This may affect some queries if you change a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
table to a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table.
<LI>

To ensure that you accidentally don't do anything foolish, you can't create
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables bigger than <CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
The memory needed for one row in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table is:

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> provides MySQL with a transaction-safe (<CODE>ACID</CODE> compliant)
storage engine with commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities.
InnoDB does locking on row level and also provides an Oracle-style
consistent
non-locking read in <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s. These features increase
multiuser concurrency and performance. There is no need for
lock escalation in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>,
because row level locks in InnoDB fit in very small space.
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is the first storage manager in MySQL to support
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraints.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> has been designed for maximum performance when processing
large data volumes. Its CPU efficiency is probably not
matched by any other disk-based relational database engine.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is used in production at numerous
large database sites requiring high performance.
The famous Internet news site Slashdot.org runs on
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>. Mytrix, Inc. stores over 1 TB of data in
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, and another site handles an average
load of 800 inserts/updates per second in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Technically, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is a complete database backend placed under MySQL.
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> has its own buffer pool for caching data and indexes in main
memory. <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which
may consist of several files (or raw disk partitions).
This is different from, for example,
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables where each table is stored as a separate file.
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables can be of any size even on operating
systems where file-size is limited to 2 GB.

<P>
From MySQL version 4.0, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is enabled by default.
The following information only applies to the 3.23 series.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB tables are included in the MySQL source distribution
starting from 3.23.34a and are activated in the MySQL -Max
binary of the 3.23 series.
For Windows the -Max binaries are contained in the
standard distribution.

</P>
<P>
If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes
support for InnoDB, simply follow the instructions of the
MySQL manual
for installing a binary version of MySQL. If you already have
MySQL-3.23 installed, then the simplest way to install
MySQL -Max is to replace the server executable <TT>`mysqld'</TT>
with the corresponding executable in the -Max distribution.
MySQL and MySQL -Max differ only in the server executable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.11  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
To compile MySQL with InnoDB support,
download MySQL-3.23.34a or newer version from
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>
and configure MySQL with the
<CODE>--with-innodb</CODE> option. See the
MySQL manual
about installing a MySQL source distribution.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
cd /path/to/source/of/mysql-3.23.37
./configure --with-innodb
</PRE>

<P>
To use InnoDB tables in MySQL-Max-3.23 you <STRONG>must</STRONG> specify
configuration parameters in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section of the
configuration file <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>, or on Windows optionally in
<TT>`my.ini'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
At the minimum, in 3.23 you must specify <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>
where you specify the names and the sizes of datafiles. If you do
not mention <CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> the default
is to create these files to the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.
If you specify <CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> as an empty string,
then you can give absolute paths to your datafiles in
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.

The minimal way

To enable <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables in MySQL version 3.23, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_in_MySQL_3.23">7.5.2  InnoDB in MySQL Version 3.23</A>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL-4.0 you are not required to do anything specific to
enable <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.

</P>
<P>
The default behaviour in MySQL-4.0 and MySQL-4.1 is to
create an auto-extending 10 MB file
<TT>`ibdata1'</TT> in the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL and
two 5 MB <TT>`ib_logfile'</TT>s to the <CODE>datadir</CODE>.
(In MySQL-4.0.0 and 4.0.1 the datafile is 64 MB and not auto-extending.)

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: To get good performance you <STRONG>should</STRONG> explicitly
set the InnoDB parameters listed in the following examples.

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to use <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, you can add the
<CODE>skip-innodb</CODE> option to your MySQL option file.

</P>
<P>
Starting from versions 3.23.50 and 4.0.2, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> allows the last
datafile on the <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> line
to be specified as <STRONG>auto-extending</STRONG>. The syntax for
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> is then the following:

<PRE>
pathtodatafile:sizespecification;pathtodatafile:sizespecification;...
...  ;pathtodatafile:sizespecification[:autoextend[:max:sizespecification]]
</PRE>

<P>
If you specify the last datafile with the <CODE>autoextend</CODE> option,
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
will extend the last datafile if it runs out of free space in the
tablespace. The increment is 8 MB at a time. An example:

<PRE>
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:100M:autoextend
</PRE>

<P>
instructs <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> to create just a single datafile whose initial size is
100 MB and which is extended in 8 MB blocks when space runs out.
If the disk becomes full you may want to add another datafile
to another disk, for example. Then you have to look at the size
of <TT>`ibdata1'</TT>, round the size downward to
the closest multiple of 1024 * 1024 bytes (= 1 MB), and specify
the rounded size of <TT>`ibdata1'</TT> explicitly in
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
After that you can add another datafile:

<PRE>
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:988M;/disk2/ibdata2:50M:autoextend
</PRE>

<P>
Be cautious on filesystems where the maximum file-size is 2 GB.
InnoDB is not aware of the OS maximum file-size. On those filesystems
you might want to specify the max size for the datafile:

<PRE>
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:100M:autoextend:max:2000M
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>A simple <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> example.</STRONG> Suppose you have a computer
with 128 MB RAM and one hard disk. Below is an example of
possible configuration parameters in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or
<TT>`my.ini'</TT> for InnoDB. We assume you are running
MySQL-Max-3.23.50 or later, or MySQL-4.0.2 or later.
This example suits most users, both on Unix and Windows,
who do not want to distribute InnoDB datafiles and
log files on several disks. This creates an
auto-extending datafile <TT>`ibdata1'</TT> and two InnoDB log files
<TT>`ib_logfile0'</TT> and <TT>`ib_logfile1'</TT> to the
<CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL (typically <TT>`/mysql/data'</TT>).
Also the small archived InnoDB log file
<TT>`ib_arch_log_0000000000'</TT> ends up in the <CODE>datadir</CODE>.

When you for the first time create an InnoDB database, it is
best that you start the MySQL server from the command prompt.
Then InnoDB will print the information about the database
creation to the screen, and you see what is happening.
See below next section what the printout should look like.
For example, in Windows you can start <TT>`mysqld-max.exe'</TT> with: 

</P>

<STRONG>Where to put <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> in Windows?</STRONG>
The rules for Windows are the following:

<UL>
<LI>Only one of <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> should be created.

<LI>The <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file should be placed in the root

directory of the drive <TT>`C:'</TT>.
<LI>The <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file should be placed in the WINDIR directory, e.g,

<TT>`C:\WINDOWS'</TT> or <TT>`C:\WINNT'</TT>. You can use the <CODE>SET</CODE>
command of MS-DOS to print the value of WINDIR.
<LI>If your PC uses a boot loader where the <TT>`C:'</TT> drive

is not the boot drive, then your only option is to use the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Where to specify options in Unix?</STRONG>
On Unix <TT>`mysqld'</TT> reads options from the following files, if they exist,
in the following order: 

<UL>
<LI><TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>  Global options.

<LI><TT>`COMPILATION_DATADIR/my.cnf'</TT>  Server-specific options.

(typically <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary installation or <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source installation).

</P>
<P>
If you are not sure from where <TT>`mysqld'</TT> reads its <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>

option to the server:
<CODE>mysqld --defaults-file=your_path_to_my_cnf</CODE>.

<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>, adding a possible slash or
backslash in between if needed. If the keyword
<CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> is not mentioned in
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> at all, the default for it is the
'dot' directory <TT>`./'</TT> which means the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.

<P>
Note that we have placed the two datafiles on different disks.
InnoDB will fill the tablespace
formed by the datafiles from bottom up. In some cases it will
improve the performance of the database if all data is not placed
on the same physical disk. Putting log files on a different disk from
data is very often beneficial for performance.
You can also use <STRONG>raw disk partitions</STRONG> (raw devices)
as datafiles. In some Unixes
they speed up I/O. See the manual section on InnoDB file space management 
about how to specify them in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: on Linux x86 you must be careful you <STRONG>do not set memory usage
too high</STRONG>. glibc will allow the process heap to grow over thread stacks,
which will crash your server. It is a risk if the value of

<PRE>

max_connections * (sort_buffer + read_buffer_size) + max_connections * 2 MB
</PRE>

<P>
is close to 2 GB or exceeds 2 GB. Each thread will use a stack
(often 2 MB, but in MySQL AB binaries only 256 KB) and in the worst case also
<CODE>sort_buffer + read_buffer_size</CODE>
additional memory.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>How to tune other <TT>`mysqld'</TT> server parameters?</STRONG>

The meanings of the configuration parameters are the following:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
The common part of the directory path for all InnoDB datafiles.
If you do not mentioned this option in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
the default is the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.
You can specify this also as an empty string, in which case you
can use absolute file paths in <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> </TD><TD>
Paths to individual datafiles and their sizes. The full directory path
to each datafile is acquired by concatenating innodb_data_home_dir to
the paths specified here. The file sizes are specified in megabytes,
hence the 'M' after the size specification above.
InnoDB also understands the abbreviation 'G', 1 G meaning 1024 MB.
Starting from
3.23.44 you can set the file-size bigger than 4 GB on those
operating systems which support big files.
On some operating systems files must be &#60; 2 GB.
If you do not specify <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>, the default
behaviour starting from 4.0 is to create a 10 MB auto-extending
datafile <TT>`ibdata1'</TT>.
The sum of the sizes of the files must be at least 10 MB.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_mirrored_log_groups</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of identical copies of log groups we
keep for the database. Currently this should be set to 1.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_group_home_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
Directory path to InnoDB log files.
If you do not mentioned this option in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
the default is the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_files_in_group</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of log files in the log group. InnoDB writes to the files in a
circular fashion. Value 2 is recommended here. The default is 2.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_file_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of each log file in a log group in megabytes. Sensible values range
from 1M to 1/nth of the size of the buffer pool specified below,
where n is the number of log files in the group. The
bigger the value,
the less checkpoint flush activity is needed in the buffer pool,
saving disk I/O. But bigger log files also mean that recovery will be
slower in case of a crash. The combined size of log files must
be &#60; 4 GB on 32-bit computers.
The default is 5M.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_buffer_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
The size of the buffer which InnoDB uses to write log to the log files
on disk.  Sensible values range from 1M to 8M.
A big log buffer allows large transactions to run without a need
to write the log to disk until the transaction commit. Thus, if you have
big transactions, making the log buffer big will save disk I/O.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</CODE> </TD><TD>
Normally you set this to 1, meaning that at a transaction commit the log
is flushed to disk, and the modifications made by the transaction become
permanent, and survive a database crash. If you are willing to
compromise this safety, and you are running small transactions, you may
set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk I/O to the logs. Value 0 means
that the log is only written to the log file and the log file flushed to
disk approximately once per second. Value 2 means the log is written
to the log file at each commit, but the log file is only flushed to
disk approximately once per second. The default value is 1 starting from
MySQL-4.0.13, previously it was 0.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_arch_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
The directory where fully written log files would be archived if we used
log archiving.  The value of this parameter should currently be set the
same as <CODE>innodb_log_group_home_dir</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_archive</CODE> </TD><TD>
This value should currently be set to 0.  As recovery from a backup is
done by MySQL using its own log files, there is currently no need to
archive InnoDB log files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_buffer_pool_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
The size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of
its tables.  The bigger you set this the less disk I/O is needed to
access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may cause
paging in the operating system.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_buffer_pool_awe_mem_mb</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of the buffer pool in MB, if it is placed in the AWE memory of
32-bit Windows. Available starting from 4.1.0 and only relevant in
32-bit Windows. If your 32-bit Windows operating system supports
&#62; 4 GB memory, so-called Address Windowing Extensions, you can
allocate the InnoDB buffer pool into the AWE physical memory using
this parameter. The maximum possible value for this is 64000.
If this parameter is specified, then innodb_buffer_pool_size is
the window in the 32-bit address space of mysqld where InnoDB maps
that AWE memory. A good value for innodb_buffer_pool_size is then
500M.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_additional_mem_pool_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of a memory pool InnoDB uses to store data dictionary information
and other internal data structures. A sensible value for this might be
2M, but the more tables you have in your application the more you will
need to allocate here. If InnoDB runs out of memory in this pool, it
will start to allocate memory from the operating system, and write
warning messages to the MySQL error log.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_file_io_threads</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of file I/O threads in InnoDB. Normally, this should be 4, but
on Windows disk I/O may benefit from a larger number.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_lock_wait_timeout</CODE> </TD><TD>
Timeout in seconds an InnoDB transaction may wait for a lock before
being rolled back.  InnoDB automatically detects transaction deadlocks
in its own lock table and rolls back the transaction. If you use the
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> command, or other transaction-safe storage engines
than InnoDB in the same transaction, then a deadlock may arise which
InnoDB cannot notice. In cases like this the timeout is useful to
resolve the situation.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> </TD><TD>
(Available from 3.23.40 up.)
The default value for this is <CODE>fdatasync</CODE>.
Another option is <CODE>O_DSYNC</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_force_recovery</CODE> </TD><TD>
Warning: this option should only be defined in an emergency situation
when you want to dump your tables from a corrupt database!
Possible values are 1 - 6. See below at section 'Forcing
recovery' about the meanings of the values.
As a safety measure InnoDB prevents a user from modifying
data when this option is &#62; 0.
This option is
available starting from version 3.23.44.

<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_init" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_init">7.5.4  Creating InnoDB Tablespace</A></H3>

<P>
Suppose you have installed MySQL and have edited <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> so that
it contains the necessary InnoDB configuration parameters.
Before starting MySQL you should check that the directories you have
specified for InnoDB datafiles and log files exist and that you have
access rights to those directories. InnoDB
cannot create directories, only files. Check also you have enough disk space
for the data and log files.

</P>
<P>
When you now start MySQL, InnoDB will start creating your datafiles
and log files. InnoDB will print something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: The first specified datafile /home/heikki/data/ibdata1
did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!
InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata1 size to 134217728
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: datafile /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 did not exist:
new to be created
InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 size to 262144000
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 did not exist:

InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 size to 5242880
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 did not exist:
new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 size to 5242880
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile2 did not exist:
new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile2 size to 5242880
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
</PRE>

<P>
A new InnoDB database has now been created. You can connect to the MySQL
server with the usual MySQL client programs like <CODE>mysql</CODE>.
When you shut down the MySQL server with <TT>`mysqladmin shutdown'</TT>,
InnoDB output will be like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Normal shutdown
010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Shutdown Complete
InnoDB: Starting shutdown...
InnoDB: Shutdown completed
</PRE>

<P>
You can now look at the datafiles and logs directories and you
will see the files created. The log directory will also contain
a small file named <TT>`ib_arch_log_0000000000'</TT>. That file
resulted from the database creation, after which InnoDB switched off
log archiving.
When MySQL is again started, the output will be like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="Error_creating_InnoDB" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_creating_InnoDB">7.5.4.1  If Something Goes Wrong in Database Creation</A></H4>

<P>
If InnoDB prints an operating system error in a file operation,
usually the problem is one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>You did not create InnoDB data or log directories.

<LI><TT>`mysqld'</TT> does not have the rights to create files in those

directories.
<LI><TT>`mysqld'</TT> does not read the right <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT>

file, and consequently does not see the options you specified.
<LI>The disk is full or a disk quota is exceeded.

<LI>You have created a subdirectory whose name is equal to a datafile

you specified.
<LI>There is a syntax error in <CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE>

or <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
If something goes wrong in an InnoDB database creation, you should
delete all files created by InnoDB. This means all datafiles, all log
files, the small archived log file, and in the case you already did
create some InnoDB tables, delete also the corresponding <TT>`.frm'</TT>
files for these tables from the MySQL database
directories. Then you can try the InnoDB database creation again.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Using_InnoDB_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_InnoDB_tables">7.5.5  Creating InnoDB Tables</A></H3>

<P>
Suppose you have started the MySQL client with the command
<CODE>mysql test</CODE>.
To create a table in the InnoDB format you must specify
<CODE>TYPE = InnoDB</CODE> in the table creation SQL command:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (A INT, B CHAR (20), INDEX (A)) TYPE = InnoDB;
</PRE>

<P>
This SQL command will create a table and an index on column <CODE>A</CODE>
into the InnoDB tablespace consisting of the datafiles you specified
in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>. In addition MySQL will create a file
<TT>`CUSTOMER.frm'</TT> to the MySQL database directory <TT>`test'</TT>.
Internally, InnoDB will add to its own data dictionary an entry
for table <CODE>'test/CUSTOMER'</CODE>. Thus you can create a table
of the same name <CODE>CUSTOMER</CODE> in another database of MySQL, and
the table names will not collide inside InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
You can query the amount of free space in the InnoDB tablespace
by issuing the table status command of MySQL for any table you have
created with <CODE>TYPE = InnoDB</CODE>. Then the amount of free
space in the tablespace appears in the table comment section in the
output of <CODE>SHOW</CODE>. An example:

</P>

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM test LIKE 'CUSTOMER'
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the statistics <CODE>SHOW</CODE> gives about InnoDB tables
are only approximate: they are used in SQL optimisation. Table and
index reserved sizes in bytes are accurate, though.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Converting_tables_to_InnoDB" HREF="manual_toc.html#Converting_tables_to_InnoDB">7.5.5.1  Converting MyISAM Tables to InnoDB</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB does not have a special optimisation for separate index creation.
Therefore it does not pay to export and import the table and create indexes
afterwards.
The fastest way to alter a table to InnoDB is to do the inserts
directly to an InnoDB table, that is, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... TYPE=INNODB</CODE>,
or create an empty InnoDB table with identical definitions and insert
the rows with <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To get better control over the insertion process, it may be good to insert
big tables in pieces:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable
   WHERE yourkey &#62; something AND yourkey &#60;= somethingelse;
</PRE>

<P>
After all data has been inserted you can rename the tables.

</P>
<P>
During the conversion of big tables you should set the InnoDB
buffer pool size big
to reduce disk I/O. Not bigger than 80% of the physical memory, though.
You should set InnoDB log files big, and also the log buffer large.

</P>
<P>
Make sure you do not run out of tablespace: InnoDB tables take a lot
more space than MyISAM tables. If an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> runs out
of space, it will start a rollback, and that can take hours if it is
disk-bound.
In inserts InnoDB uses the insert buffer to merge secondary index records
to indexes in batches. That saves a lot of disk I/O. In rollback no such
mechanism is used, and the rollback can take 30 times longer than the
insertion.

</P>
<P>
In the case of a runaway rollback, if you do not have valuable data in your
database,
it is better that you kill the database process and delete all InnoDB
datafiles
and log files and all InnoDB table <TT>`.frm'</TT> files, and start
your job again, rather than wait for millions of disk I/Os to complete.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints">7.5.5.2  <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> Constraints</A></H4>

<P>
Starting from version 3.23.43b InnoDB features foreign key constraints.
InnoDB is the first MySQL table type which allows you to define foreign key
constraints to guard the integrity of your data.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of a foreign key constraint definition in InnoDB:

<PRE>
[CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY (index_col_name, ...)
                  REFERENCES table_name (index_col_name, ...)
                  [ON DELETE {CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION
                              | RESTRICT}]
                  [ON UPDATE {CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION
                              | RESTRICT}]
</PRE>

<P>
Both tables have to be InnoDB type,
<STRONG>in the table there must be an INDEX where the foreign key columns
are listed as the FIRST columns in the same order,</STRONG> and
<STRONG>in the referenced table there must be an INDEX where
the referenced columns are listed as the FIRST columns
in the same order.</STRONG> InnoDB does not auto-create indexes on
foreign keys or referenced keys: you have to create them
explicitly. The indexes are needed for foreign key checks to be fast
and not require a table scan. 

</P>
<P>
Corresponding columns in the foreign key
and the referenced key must have similar internal datatypes
inside InnoDB so that they can be compared without a type
conversion.
The <STRONG>size and the signedness of integer types has to be the same</STRONG>.
The length of string types need not be the same.
If you specify a <CODE>SET NULL</CODE> action, make sure you
have <STRONG>not declared the columns in the child table</STRONG>
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If MySQL gives the error number 1005 from a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
statement, and the error message string refers to errno 150, then
the table creation failed because a foreign key constraint was not
correctly formed.
Similarly, if an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> fails and it refers to errno
150, that means a foreign key definition would be incorrectly
formed for the altered table. Starting from version 4.0.13,
you can use <CODE>SHOW INNODB STATUS</CODE> to look at a detailed explanation
of the latest InnoDB foreign key error in the server. 

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50, InnoDB does not check foreign key
constraints on those foreign key or referenced key values
which contain a NULL column.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A deviation from SQL standards:</STRONG> if in the parent table
there are several rows which have the same referenced key value,
then InnoDB acts in foreign key checks like the other parent
rows with the same key value would not exist. For example,
if you have defined a <CODE>RESTRICT</CODE> type constraint, and there
is a child row with several parent rows, InnoDB does not allow
the deletion of any of those parent rows. 

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50, you can also associate the
<CODE>ON DELETE CASCADE</CODE> or <CODE>ON DELETE SET NULL</CODE> clause with
the foreign key constraint. Corresponding <CODE>ON UPDATE</CODE> options
are available starting from 4.0.8. If <CODE>ON DELETE CASCADE</CODE> is
specified, and a row in the parent table is deleted, then InnoDB
automatically deletes also all those rows in the child table
whose foreign key values are equal to the referenced key value in
the parent row. If <CODE>ON DELETE SET NULL</CODE> is specified, the
child rows are automatically updated so that the columns in the
foreign key are set to the SQL <CODE>NULL</CODE> value. 

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A deviation from SQL standards:</STRONG> if
<CODE>ON UPDATE CASCADE</CODE> or <CODE>ON UPDATE SET NULL</CODE> recurses to
update the SAME TABLE it has already updated during the cascade,
it acts like <CODE>RESTRICT</CODE>. This is to prevent infinite loops
resulting from cascaded updates. A self-referential <CODE>ON DELETE
SET NULL</CODE>, on the other hand, works starting from 4.0.13.
A self-referential <CODE>ON DELETE CASCADE</CODE> has always worked. 

</P>
<P>
An example:

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE parent(id INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id)) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE child(id INT, parent_id INT, INDEX par_ind (parent_id),
             FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id)
             ON DELETE SET NULL
) TYPE=INNODB;
</PRE>

<P>
A complex example:

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE product (category INT NOT NULL, id INT NOT NULL,
                      price DECIMAL,
                      PRIMARY KEY(category, id)) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE customer (id INT NOT NULL,
                      PRIMARY KEY (id)) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE product_order (no INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                      product_category INT NOT NULL,
                      product_id INT NOT NULL,
                      customer_id INT NOT NULL,
                      PRIMARY KEY(no),
                      INDEX (product_category, product_id),
                      FOREIGN KEY (product_category, product_id)
                        REFERENCES product(category, id)
                        ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,
                      INDEX (customer_id),
                      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
                        REFERENCES customer(id)) TYPE=INNODB;
</PRE>

<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50, InnoDB allows you to add a new
foreign key constraint to a table through

<PRE>
ALTER TABLE yourtablename
ADD [CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES anothertablename(...)
[on_delete_and_on_update_actions]
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Remember to create the required indexes first</STRONG>, though.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 4.0.13, InnoDB supports 

<PRE>
ALTER TABLE yourtablename DROP FOREIGN KEY internally_generated_foreign_key_id
</PRE>

<P>
You have to use <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> to determine the internally
generated foreign key ID when you want to drop a foreign key. 
                           
In InnoDB versions &#60; 3.23.50 <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>
should not be used in connection with tables which have foreign
key constraints or which are referenced in foreign key constraints:
Any <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> removes all foreign key
constraints defined for the table. You should not use
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to the referenced table either, but
use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> to modify the
schema. When MySQL does an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> it may internally
use <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>, and that will confuse the
foreign key costraints which refer to the table.
A <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> statement is in MySQL
processed as an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, and these
restrictions apply also to it.

</P>
<P>
When doing foreign key checks, InnoDB sets shared row
level locks on child or parent records it has to look at.
InnoDB checks foreign key constraints immediately: the check
is not deferred to transaction commit.

</P>
<P>
If you want to ignore foreign key constraints during, for example for a
<CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> operation, you can do <CODE>SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB allows you to drop any table even though that
would break the foreign key constraints which reference
the table. When you drop a table the constraints which
were defined in its create statement are also dropped.

</P>
<P>
If you re-create a table which was dropped, it has to have
a definition which conforms to the foreign key constraints
referencing it. It must have the right column names and types,
and it must have indexes on the referenced keys, as stated above.
If these are not satisfied, MySQL returns error number 1005
and refers to errno 150 in the error message string.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50 InnoDB returns the foreign key
definitions of a table when you call

<PRE>
SHOW CREATE TABLE yourtablename
</PRE>

<P>
Then also <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> produces correct definitions
of tables to the dump file, and does not forget about the
foreign keys.

</P>
<P>
You can also list the foreign key constraints for a table
<CODE>T</CODE> with

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM yourdatabasename LIKE 'T'
</PRE>

<P>
The foreign key constraints are listed in the table comment of
the output.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Adding_and_removing" HREF="manual_toc.html#Adding_and_removing">7.5.6  Adding and Removing InnoDB Data and Log Files</A></H3>

<P>
From version 3.23.50 and 4.0.2 you can specify the last InnoDB datafile
to <CODE>autoextend</CODE>. Alternatively, you can increase to your tablespace
by specifying an additional datafile. To do this you have to shut down
the MySQL server, edit the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file adding a new datafile
to <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>, and then start the MySQL server again.

</P>
<P>
Currently you cannot remove a datafile from InnoDB. To decrease the
size of your database you have to use <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> to dump
all your tables, create a new database, and import your tables to the
new database.

</P>
<P>
If you want to change the number or the size of your InnoDB log files,
you have to shut down MySQL and make sure that it shuts down without errors.
Then copy the old log files into a safe place just in case something
went wrong in the shutdown and you will need them to recover the
database. Delete then the old log files from the log file directory,
edit <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>, and start MySQL again. InnoDB will tell
you at the startup that it is creating new log files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Backing_up" HREF="manual_toc.html#Backing_up">7.5.7  Backing up and Recovering an InnoDB Database</A></H3>

<P>
The key to safe database management is taking regular backups.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB Hot Backup is an online backup tool you can use to
backup your InnoDB database while it is running. InnoDB
Hot Backup does not require you to shut down your database
and it does not set any locks or disturb your normal
database processing. InnoDB Hot Backup is a non-free
additional tool which is not included in the standard
MySQL distribution. See the InnoDB Hot Backup homepage
<a HREF="http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html">http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html</a>
for detailed information and screenshots. 

</P>
<P>
If you are able to shut down your MySQL server, then to take
a 'binary' backup of your database you have to do the following: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Shut down your MySQL database and make sure it shuts down without errors.
<LI>

Copy all your datafiles into a safe place.
<LI>

Copy all your InnoDB log files to a safe place.
<LI>

Copy your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> configuration file(s) to a safe place.
<LI>

Copy all the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files for your InnoDB tables into a
safe place.
</UL>

<P>
In addition to taking the binary backups described above,
you should also regularly take dumps of your tables with
<TT>`mysqldump'</TT>. The reason to this is that a binary file
may be corrupted without you noticing it. Dumped tables are stored
into text files which are human-readable and much simpler than
database binary files. Seeing table corruption from dumped files
is easier, and since their format is simpler, the chance for
serious data corruption in them is smaller.

</P>
<P>
A good idea is to take the dumps at the same time you take a binary
backup of your database. You have to shut out all clients from your
database to get a consistent snapshot of all your tables into your
dumps. Then you can take the binary backup, and you will then have
a consistent snapshot of your database in two formats.

</P>
<P>
To be able to recover your InnoDB database to the present from the
binary backup described above, you have to run your MySQL database
with the general logging and log archiving of MySQL switched on. Here
by the general logging we mean the logging mechanism of the MySQL server
which is independent of InnoDB logs.

</P>
<P>
To recover from a crash of your MySQL server process, the only thing
you have to do is to restart it. InnoDB will automatically check the
logs and perform a roll-forward of the database to the present.
InnoDB will automatically roll back uncommitted transactions which were
present at the time of the crash. During recovery, InnoDB will print
out something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.
InnoDB: Starting recovery from log files...
InnoDB: Starting log scan based on checkpoint at

</PRE>

<P>
If your database gets corrupted or your disk fails, you have
to do the recovery from a backup. In the case of corruption, you should
first find a backup which is not corrupted. From a backup do the recovery
from the general log files of MySQL according to instructions in the
MySQL manual.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Forcing_recovery" HREF="manual_toc.html#Forcing_recovery">7.5.7.1  Forcing recovery</A></H4>

<P>
If there is database page corruption, you may want to dump
your tables from the database with <CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE>,
and usually most of the data
is intact and correct. But the corruption may cause
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table</CODE>, or InnoDB
background operations to crash or assert, or even the InnoDB
roll-forward recovery to crash. Starting from the InnoDB
version 3.23.44, there is a <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option with which
you can force
InnoDB to start up, and you can also prevent background operations
from running, so that
you will be able to dump your tables. For example, you can set

<PRE>
set-variable = innodb_force_recovery = 4
</PRE>

<P>
in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The alternatives for <CODE>innodb_force_recovery</CODE> are listed below.
The database must not otherwise be used with these options!
As a safety measure InnoDB prevents a user from doing <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> when this option is &#62; 0.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.53 and 4.0.4, you are allowed to
<CODE>DROP</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE> a table even if
forced recovery is used. If you know that a certain table is causing
a crash in rollback, you can drop it.
You can use this also to stop a runaway rollback
caused by a failing mass import or <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
You can kill the mysqld process and
use the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option <CODE>innodb_force_recovery=3</CODE>
to bring your database up without the rollback.
Then <CODE>DROP</CODE> the table which is causing the runaway rollback.

</P>
<P>
A bigger number below
means that all precautions of lower numbers are included. If you are
able to dump your tables with an option at most 4, then you are
relatively safe that only some data on corrupt individual pages
is lost. Option 6 is more dramatic, because database pages are left
in an obsolete state, which in turn may introduce more corruption
into B-trees and other database structures.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>1 (SRV_FORCE_IGNORE_CORRUPT) let the server run even if it detects a

                                corrupt page; try to make
                                <CODE>SELECT * FROM table</CODE>
                                jump over corrupt index records and pages,
                                which helps in dumping tables;
<LI>2 (SRV_FORCE_NO_BACKGROUND) prevent the main thread from

                                running: if a crash would occur
                                in purge, this prevents it;
<LI>3 (SRV_FORCE_NO_TRX_UNDO) do not run transaction rollbacks

                                after recovery;
<LI>4 (SRV_FORCE_NO_IBUF_MERGE) prevent also insert buffer merge operations:

                                if they would cause a crash, better
                                not do them; do not calculate table statistics;
<LI>5 (SRV_FORCE_NO_UNDO_LOG_SCAN) do not look at undo logs when

                                starting the database: InnoDB will
                                treat even incomplete transactions
                                as committed;
<LI>6 (SRV_FORCE_NO_LOG_REDO)   do not do the log roll-forward

                                in connection with recovery.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_checkpoints" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_checkpoints">7.5.7.2  Checkpoints</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB implements a checkpoint mechanism called a fuzzy
checkpoint. InnoDB will flush modified database pages from the buffer
pool in small batches, there is no need to flush the buffer pool
in one single batch, which would in practice stop processing
of user SQL statements for a while.

</P>
<P>
In crash recovery InnoDB looks for a checkpoint label written
to the log files. It knows that all modifications to the database
before the label are already present on the disk image of the database.
Then InnoDB scans the log files forward from the place of the checkpoint
applying the logged modifications to the database.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB writes to the log files in a circular fashion.
All committed modifications which make the database pages in the buffer
pool different from the images on disk must be available in the log files
in case InnoDB has to do a recovery. This means that when InnoDB starts
to reuse a log file in the circular fashion, it has to make sure that the
database page images on disk already contain the modifications
logged in the log file InnoDB is going to reuse. In other words, InnoDB
has to make a checkpoint and often this involves flushing of
modified database pages to disk.

</P>
<P>
The above explains why making your log files very big may save
disk I/O in checkpointing. It can make sense to set
the total size of the log files as big as the buffer pool or even bigger.
The drawback in big log files is that crash recovery can last longer
because there will be more log to apply to the database.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Moving" HREF="manual_toc.html#Moving">7.5.8  Moving an InnoDB Database to Another Machine</A></H3>

<P>
On Windows InnoDB stores the database names and table names
internally always in lower case. To move databases in a binary format 
from Unix to Windows or from Windows to Unix you should have all table
and database names in lower case. A convenient way to accomplish this
is to add on Unix the line 

<PRE>
set-variable=lower_case_table_names=1
</PRE>

<P>
to the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section of your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> before you start
creating your tables. On Windows the setting 1 is the default. 

</P>
<P>
InnoDB data and log files are binary-compatible on all platforms
if the floating-point number format on the machines is the same.
You can move an InnoDB database simply by copying all the relevant
files, which we already listed in the previous section on backing up
a database. If the floating-point formats on the machines are
different but you have not used <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
datatypes in your tables then the procedure is the same: just copy
the relevant files. If the formats are different and your tables
contain floating-point data, you have to use <TT>`mysqldump'</TT>
and <TT>`mysqlimport'</TT> to move those tables.

</P>
<P>
A performance tip is to switch off auto-commit mode when you import
data into your database, assuming your tablespace has enough space for
the big rollback segment the big import transaction will generate.
Do the commit only after importing a whole table or a segment of
a table.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_transaction_model" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_transaction_model">7.5.9  InnoDB Transaction Model and Locking</A></H3>

<P>
In the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> transaction model the goal has been to combine the best
properties of a multi-versioning database to traditional two-phase locking.
InnoDB does locking on row level and runs queries by default
as non-locking consistent reads, in the style of Oracle.
The lock table in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is stored so space-efficiently that lock
escalation is not needed: typically several users are allowed
to lock every row in the database, or any random subset of the rows,
without <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> running out of memory.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> all user activity happens inside transactions. If the
autocommit mode is used in MySQL, then each SQL statement
forms a single transaction.
MySQL always starts a new connection with the autocommit
mode switched on.

</P>
<P>
If the autocommit mode is
switched off with <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0</CODE>,
then we can think that a user always has a transaction
open. If he issues
the SQL <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement,
it ends the current transaction, and a new one starts. Both statements
will release all <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> locks that were set during the
current transaction. A <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> means that the
changes made in the current transaction are made permanent
and become visible to other users. A <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement,
on the other hand, cancels all modifications made by the current
transaction.

</P>
<P>
If the connection has <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT = 1</CODE>, then the user
can still perform a multi-statement transaction by starting it with
<CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> or
<CODE>BEGIN</CODE> and ending it with <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>
or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_transaction_isolation" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_transaction_isolation">7.5.9.1  InnoDB and <CODE>SET ... TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
In terms of the SQL-92 transaction isolation levels,
the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> default is <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE>.
Starting from version 4.0.5, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> offers all 4 different
transaction isolation levels described by the SQL-92 standard.
You can set the default isolation level for all connections
in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section of <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
transaction-isolation = {READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED
                         | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE}

</PRE>

<P>
A user can change the isolation level of a single session or
all new incoming connections with the <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE>
statement. Its syntax is as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
SET [SESSION | GLOBAL] TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
                       {READ UNCOMMITTED | READ COMMITTED
                        | REPEATABLE READ | SERIALIZABLE}
</PRE>

<P>
Note that there are no hyphens in level names in the SQL syntax.

</P>
<P>
The default behaviour is to set the isolation level for the next (not
started) transaction.  If you use the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> keyword, the statement
sets the default transaction level globally for all new connections
created from that point on (but not existing connections).
You need the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege to do this.  Using the <CODE>SESSION</CODE>
keyword sets the default transaction level for all future transactions
performed on the current connection.  Any client is free to change the
session isolation level (even in the middle of a transaction), or the
isolation level for the next transaction.
In versions earlier than 3.23.50, <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> had no effect
on <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables. In versions &#60; 4.0.5 only <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE>
and <CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE> were available.

</P>
<P>
You can query the global and session transaction isolation levels with:

<PRE>
SELECT @@global.tx_isolation;
SELECT @@tx_isolation;
</PRE>

<P>
In row level locking <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> uses so-called next-key locking.
That means that besides index records, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> can also lock
the ``gap'' before an index record to block insertions by other users
immediately before the index record. A next-key lock means
a lock which locks an index record and the gap before it.
A gap lock means a lock which only locks a gap before some
index record.

</P>
<P>
A detailed description of each isolation level in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>READ UNCOMMITTED</CODE> This is also called
``dirty read'': non-locking <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are performed
so that we do not look at a possible earlier version of a record; 
thus they are not 'consistent' reads under this isolation level;
otherwise this level works like <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>
Somewhat Oracle-like isolation level.
All <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>
statements
only lock the index records, <STRONG>not</STRONG> the gaps before them, and
thus allow free inserting of new records next to locked
records.
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> which use
a unique index with a unique search condition,
only lock the index record found, not the gap before it.
But still in range type
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
must set next-key or gap locks and block insertions
by other users to the
gaps covered by the range. This is necessary
since ``phantom rows'' have to be blocked for MySQL
replication and recovery to work.
<STRONG>Consistent reads</STRONG> behave as in
Oracle: each consistent read, even within the same
transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot.
<LI>

<CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> This is the default isolation level of
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
which use
a unique index with a unique search condition,
only lock the index record found, not the gap before it.
Otherwise these operations employ next-key locking, locking
the index range scanned with next-key or gap locks, and
block new insertions by other users.
In <STRONG>consistent reads</STRONG> there is an important difference
from the previous isolation level: in this level
all consistent reads within the same transaction read the
same snapshot established by the first read. This convention
means that if you issue several plain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s
within the same transaction, these <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are
consistent also with respect to each other.
<LI>

<CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE> This level is like
the previous one, but
all plain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are implicitly converted to
<CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_consistent_read" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_consistent_read">7.5.9.2  Consistent Non-Locking Read</A></H4>

<P>
A consistent read means that InnoDB uses its multi-versioning to
present to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in time.
The query will see the changes made by exactly those transactions
that committed before that point of time, and no changes made by
later or uncommitted transactions. The exception to this rule
is that the query will see the changes made by the transaction
itself which issues the query. 

</P>
<P>
If you are running with the default <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> isolation level,
then all consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot
established by the first such read in that transaction. You can get a
fresher snapshot for your queries by committing the current transaction
and after that issuing new queries. 

</P>
<P>
Consistent read is the default mode in which InnoDB processes
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements in <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE> and
<CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> isolation levels. A consistent read
does not set any locks on the tables it accesses, and
therefore other users are free to modify those tables at
the same time a consistent read is being performed on the table. 

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_locking_reads" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_locking_reads">7.5.9.3  Locking Reads <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
A consistent read is not convenient in some circumstances.
Suppose you want to add a new row into your table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>,
and make sure that the child already has a parent in table
<CODE>PARENT</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you use a consistent read to read the table <CODE>PARENT</CODE>
and indeed see the parent of the child in the table. Can you now safely
add the child row to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>? No, because it may
happen that meanwhile some other user has deleted the parent row
from the table <CODE>PARENT</CODE>, and you are not aware of that.

</P>
<P>
The solution is to perform the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> in a locking
mode, <CODE>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>.
  

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM PARENT WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
</PRE>

<P>
Performing a read in share mode means that we read the latest
available data, and set a shared mode lock on the rows we read.
If the latest data belongs to a yet uncommitted transaction of another
user, we will wait until that transaction commits.
A shared mode lock prevents others from updating or deleting
the row we have read. After we see that the above query returns
the parent <CODE>'Jones'</CODE>, we can safely add his child
to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>, and commit our transaction.
This example shows how to implement referential
integrity in your application code.

</P>
<P>
Let us look at another example: we have an integer counter field in
a table <CODE>CHILD_CODES</CODE> which we use to assign
a unique identifier to each child we add to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>.
Obviously, using a consistent read or a shared mode read
to read the present value of the counter is not a good idea, since
then two users of the database may see the same value for the
counter, and we will get a duplicate key error when we add
the two children with the same identifier to the table.

</P>
<P>
In this case there are two good ways to implement the
reading and incrementing of the counter: (1) update the counter
first by incrementing it by 1 and only after that read it,
or (2) read the counter first with
a lock mode <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE>, and increment after that:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT COUNTER_FIELD FROM CHILD_CODES FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE CHILD_CODES SET COUNTER_FIELD = COUNTER_FIELD + 1;
</PRE>

<P>
A <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> will read the latest
available data setting exclusive locks on each row it reads.
Thus it sets the same locks a searched SQL <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> would set
on the rows.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Next-key_locking" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Next-key_locking">7.5.9.4  Next-key Locking: Avoiding the Phantom Problem</A></H4>

<P>
In row level locking InnoDB uses an algorithm called next-key locking.
InnoDB does the row level locking so that when it searches or
scans an index of a table, it sets shared or exclusive locks
on the index records it encounters. Thus the row level locks are
more precisely called index record locks.

</P>
<P>
The locks InnoDB sets on index records also affect the 'gap'
before that index record. If a user has a shared or exclusive
lock on record R in an index, then another user cannot insert
a new index record immediately before R in the index order.
This locking of gaps is done to prevent the so-called phantom
problem. Suppose I want to read and lock all children with identifier
bigger than 100 from table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>,
and update some field in the selected rows.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID &#62; 100 FOR UPDATE;
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose there is an index on table <CODE>CHILD</CODE> on column
<CODE>ID</CODE>. Our query will scan that index starting from
the first record where <CODE>ID</CODE> is bigger than 100.
Now, if the locks set on the index records would not lock out
inserts made in the gaps, a new child might meanwhile be
inserted to the table. If now I in my transaction execute

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID &#62; 100 FOR UPDATE;
</PRE>

<P>
again, I will see a new child in the result set the query returns.
This is against the isolation principle of transactions:
a transaction should be able to run so that the data
it has read does not change during the transaction. If we regard
a set of rows as a data item, then the new 'phantom' child would break
this isolation principle.

</P>
<P>
When InnoDB scans an index it can also lock the gap
after the last record in the index. Just that happens in the previous
example: the locks set by InnoDB will prevent any insert to
the table where <CODE>ID</CODE> would be bigger than 100.

</P>
<P>
You can use next-key locking to implement a uniqueness
check in your application: if you read your data in share mode
and do not see a duplicate for a row you are going to insert,
then you can safely insert your row and know that the next-key
lock set on the successor of your row during the read will prevent
anyone meanwhile inserting a duplicate for your row. Thus the next-key
locking allows you to 'lock' the non-existence of something in your
table.

</P>

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT ... FROM ...</CODE>: this is a consistent read, reading a

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT ... FROM ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>: sets shared next-key locks
on all index records the read encounters.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE</CODE>: sets exclusive next-key locks
on all index records the read encounters.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)</CODE>: sets an exclusive lock
on the inserted row; note that this lock is not a next-key lock
and does not prevent other users from inserting to the gap before the
inserted row. If a duplicate key error occurs, sets a shared lock
on the duplicate index record.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ...</CODE> sets an exclusive
(non-next-key) lock on each row inserted into <CODE>T</CODE>. Does
the search on <CODE>S</CODE> as a consistent read, but sets shared next-key
locks on <CODE>S</CODE> if the MySQL logging is on. <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> has to set
locks in the latter case because in roll-forward recovery from a
backup every SQL statement has to be executed in exactly the same
way as it was done originally.
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT ...</CODE> performs the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
as a consistent read or with shared locks, like in the previous
item.
<LI>

<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> is done like an insert if there is no collision
on a unique key. Otherwise, an exclusive next-key lock is placed
on the row which has to be updated.
<LI>

<CODE>UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...</CODE>: sets an exclusive next-key
lock on every record the search encounters.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...</CODE>: sets an exclusive next-key
lock on every record the search encounters.
<LI>

If a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraint is defined on a table,
any insert, update, or delete which requires checking of the constraint
condition sets shared record level locks on the records it
looks at to check the constraint. Also in the case where the
constraint fails, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> sets these locks.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK TABLES ... </CODE>: sets table locks. In the implementation
the MySQL layer of code sets these locks. The automatic deadlock detection
of <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks are involved:
see the following section.
Also, since MySQL does know about row level locks,
it is possible that you
get a table lock on a table where another user currently has row level
locks. But that does not put transaction integrity into danger.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_restrictions">7.5.15  Restrictions on InnoDB Tables</A>.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Deadlock_detection" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Deadlock_detection">7.5.9.6  Deadlock Detection and Rollback</A></H4>

<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> automatically detects a deadlock of transactions and rolls back a
transaction or transactions to prevent the deadlock. Starting from
version 4.0.5, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> will try to pick small transactions to roll
back. The size of a transaction is determined by the number of rows
it has inserted, updated, or deleted. Previous to 4.0.5, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
always rolled back the transaction whose lock request was the last
one to build a deadlock, that is, a cycle in the waits-for graph
of transactions. 

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> cannot detect deadlocks where a lock set by a MySQL
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> statement is involved, or if a lock set
in another storage engine than <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is involved. You have to resolve
these situations using <CODE>innodb_lock_wait_timeout</CODE> set in
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> performs a complete rollback of a transaction, all the
locks of the transaction are released. However, if just a single SQL
statement is rolled back as a result of an error, some of the locks
set by the SQL statement may be preserved. This is because <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
stores row locks in a format where it cannot afterwards know which was
set by which SQL statement.

</P>

<P>
Suppose you are running on the default <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> isolation level.
When you issue a consistent read, that is, an ordinary <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> will give your transaction a timepoint according
to which your query sees the database. Thus, if transaction B deletes
a row and commits after your timepoint was assigned, then you will
not see the row deleted. Similarly with inserts and updates.

You can advance your timepoint by committing your transaction
and then doing another <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

This is called multi-versioned concurrency control.

<H4><A NAME="Innodb_deadlocks" HREF="manual_toc.html#Innodb_deadlocks">7.5.9.8  How to cope with deadlocks?</A></H4>

<P>
Deadlocks are a classic problem in transactional databases, but they
are not dangerous, unless they are so frequent that you cannot run
certain transactions at all. Normally you have to write your
applications so that they are always prepared to re-issue a
transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock. 

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> uses automatic row level locking. You can get deadlocks
even in the case of transactions which just insert or delete a
single row. That is because these operations are not really 'atomic':
they automatically set locks on the (possibly several) index
records of the row inserted/deleted. 

</P>
<P>
You can cope with deadlocks and reduce the
number of them with the following tricks: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>SHOW INNODB STATUS</CODE> in MySQL versions &#62;= 3.23.52 and &#62;= 4.0.3
to determine the cause of the latest deadlock. That can help you to tune
your application to avoid deadlocks. 
<LI>

Always be prepared to re-issue a transaction if it fails in a
deadlock. Deadlocks are not dangerous. Just try again. 
<LI>

Commit your transactions often. Small transactions are less prone to collide. 
<LI>

If you are using locking reads <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE>
or <CODE>... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>, try using a lower isolation
level <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>. 
<LI>

Access your tables and rows in a fixed order. Then transactions will
form nice queues, and do not deadlock. 
<LI>

Add well-chosen indexes to your tables. Then your queries need to
scan fewer index records and consequently set fewer locks.
Use <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> to determine that MySQL picks
appropriate indexes for your queries. 
<LI>

Use less locking: if you can afford a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> to return data
from an old snapshot, do not add the clause <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE>
or <CODE>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE> to it. Using <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>
isolation level is good here, because each consistent read
within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot. 
<LI>

If nothing helps, serialize your transactions with table
level locks: <CODE>LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ... ;
[do something with tables t1 and t2 here]; UNLOCK TABLES</CODE>.
Table level locks make you transactions to queue nicely,
and deadlocks are avoided. Note that <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>
implicitly starts a transaction, just like the command <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>,
and <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> implicitly ends the transaction in a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>. 
<LI>

Another solution to serialize transactions is to create
an auxiliary 'semaphore' table where there is just a
single row. Each transaction updates that row before
accessing other tables. In that way all transactions
happen in a serial fashion. Note that then also the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> instant deadlock detection algorithm works,
because the serializing lock is a row level lock.
In MySQL table level locks we have to resort to the timeout method to
resolve a deadlock.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_tuning" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_tuning">7.5.10  Performance Tuning Tips</A></H3>


<OL>
<LI>

If the Unix <TT>`top'</TT> or the Windows <TT>`Task Manager'</TT> shows that
the CPU usage percentage with your workload is less than 70%,
your workload is probably
disk-bound. Maybe you are making too many transaction commits, or the
buffer pool is too small.
Making the buffer pool bigger can help, but do not set
it bigger than 80% of physical memory.

<LI>

Wrap several modifications into one transaction. <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> must
flush the log to disk at each transaction commit, if that transaction
made modifications to the database. Since the rotation speed of a disk
is typically
at most 167 revolutions/second, that constrains the number of commits
to the same 167/second if the disk does not fool the operating system.

<LI>

If you can afford the loss of some latest committed transactions, you can
set the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> parameter <CODE>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</CODE>
to 0. <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tries to flush the log once per second anyway,
though the flush is not guaranteed.

<LI>

Make your log files big, even as big as the buffer pool. When <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
has written the log files full, it has to write the modified contents
of the buffer pool to disk in a checkpoint. Small log files will cause many
unnecessary disk writes. The drawback in big log files is that recovery
time will be longer.

<LI>

Also the log buffer should be quite big, say 8 MB.

<LI>

(Relevant from 3.23.39 up.)
In some versions of Linux and Unix, flushing files to disk with the Unix
<CODE>fdatasync</CODE> and other similar methods is surprisingly slow.
The default method <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> uses is the <CODE>fdatasync</CODE> function.
If you are not satisfied with the database write performance, you may
try setting <CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
to <CODE>O_DSYNC</CODE>, though <CODE>O_DSYNC</CODE> seems to be slower on most systems.

<LI>

In importing data to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, make sure that MySQL does not have
<CODE>autocommit=1</CODE> on. Then every insert requires a log flush to disk.
Put before your plain SQL import file line


<PRE>
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;
</PRE>

and after it


<PRE>
COMMIT;
</PRE>

If you use the <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> option <CODE>--opt</CODE>, you will get dump
files which are fast to import also to an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table, even without wrapping
them to the above <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0; ... COMMIT;</CODE> wrappers.

<LI>

Beware of big rollbacks of mass inserts: <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> uses the insert buffer
to save disk I/O in inserts, but in a corresponding rollback no such
mechanism is used. A disk-bound rollback can take 30 times the time
of the corresponding insert. Killing the database process will not
help because the rollback will start again at the database startup. The
only way to get rid of a runaway rollback is to increase the buffer pool
so that the rollback becomes CPU-bound and runs fast, or delete the whole
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> database.

<LI>

Beware also of other big disk-bound operations.
Use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> (from MySQL-4.0 up) to empty a
table, not <CODE>DELETE FROM yourtable</CODE>.

<LI>

Use the multi-line <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to reduce
communication overhead between the client and the server if you need
to insert many rows:


<PRE>
INSERT INTO yourtable VALUES (1, 2), (5, 5);
</PRE>

This tip is of course valid for inserts into any table type, not just
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.

Starting from version 3.23.42, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> includes InnoDB
Monitors which print information on the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> internal state.
Starting from versions 3.23.52 and 4.0.3 you can use a new SQL

Another way to use InnoDB Monitors is to let them continuosly
write data to the standard output of the server <TT>`mysqld'</TT>

When switched on, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Monitors print data
about once every 15 seconds. If you run <TT>`mysqld'</TT>

The <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> syntax is just a way to pass a command
to the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> engine through the MySQL SQL parser: the created
table is not relevant at all for InnoDB Monitor. If you shut down
the database when the monitor is running, and you want to start
the monitor again, you have to drop the

to start the monitor.
This syntax may change in a future release.

Some notes on the output:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If the section LOCKS HELD
BY TRANSACTIONS reports lock waits, then your application
may have lock contention. The output can also help to
trace reasons for transaction deadlocks.
<LI>

Section SYNC INFO will report reserved semaphores
if you compile InnoDB with <CODE>UNIV_SYNC_DEBUG</CODE>
defined in <TT>`univ.i'</TT>.
<LI>

Section SYNC ARRAY INFO reports threads waiting
for a semaphore and statistics on how many times
threads have needed a spin or a wait on a mutex or
a rw-lock semaphore. A big number of threads waiting
for semaphores may be a result of disk I/O, or
contention problems inside InnoDB. Contention can be
due to heavy parallelism of queries, or problems in
operating system thread scheduling.
<LI>

Section CURRENT PENDING FILE I/O'S lists pending
file I/O requests. A large number of these indicates
that the workload is disk I/O-bound.
<LI>

Section BUFFER POOL gives you statistics
on pages read and written. You can calculate from these
numbers how many datafile I/Os your queries are
currently doing.

<H3><A NAME="Implementation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Implementation">7.5.11  Implementation of Multi-versioning</A></H3>

<P>
Since InnoDB is a multi-versioned database, it must keep information
of old versions of rows in the tablespace. This information is stored
in a data structure we call a rollback segment after an analogous
data structure in Oracle.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB internally adds two fields to each row stored in the database.
A 6-byte field tells the transaction identifier for the last
transaction which inserted or updated the row. Also a deletion
is internally treated as an update where a special bit in the row
is set to mark it as deleted. Each row also contains a 7-byte
field called the roll pointer. The roll pointer points to an
undo log record written to the rollback segment. If the row was
updated, then the undo log record contains the information necessary
to rebuild the content of the row before it was updated.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB uses the information in the rollback segment to perform the
undo operations needed in a transaction rollback. It also uses the
information to build earlier versions of a row for a consistent
read.

</P>
<P>
Undo logs in the rollback segment are divided into insert and update
undo logs. Insert undo logs are only needed in transaction rollback
and can be discarded as soon as the transaction commits. Update undo logs
are used also in consistent reads, and they can be discarded only after
there is no transaction present for which InnoDB has assigned
a snapshot that in a consistent read could need the information
in the update undo log to build an earlier version of a database
row.

</P>
<P>
You must remember to commit your transactions regularly,
also those transactions which only issue consistent reads.
Otherwise
InnoDB cannot discard data from the update undo logs, and the
rollback segment may grow too big, filling up your tablespace.

</P>
<P>
The physical size of an undo log record in the rollback segment
is typically smaller than the corresponding inserted or updated
row. You can use this information to calculate the space need
for your rollback segment.

</P>
<P>
In our multi-versioning scheme a row is not physically removed from
the database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement.
Only  when InnoDB can discard the update undo log record written for
the deletion, it can also physically remove the corresponding row and
its index records from the database. This removal operation is
called a purge, and it is quite fast, usually taking the same order of
time as the SQL statement which did the deletion.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Table_and_index" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_and_index">7.5.12  Table and Index Structures</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL stores its data dictionary information of tables
in <TT>`.frm'</TT>
files in database directories. But every InnoDB type table
also has its own entry in InnoDB internal data dictionaries
inside the tablespace. When MySQL drops a table or a database,
it has to delete both a <TT>`.frm'</TT> file or files, and
the corresponding entries inside the InnoDB data dictionary.
This is the reason why you cannot move InnoDB tables between
databases simply by moving the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files, and why
<CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> did not work for InnoDB type tables
in MySQL versions &#60;= 3.23.43.

</P>
<P>
Every InnoDB table has a special index called the clustered index
where the data of the rows is stored. If you define a
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> on your table, then the index of the primary key
will be the clustered index.

</P>
<P>
If you do not define a primary key for
your table, InnoDB will internally generate a clustered index
where the rows are ordered by the row ID that InnoDB assigns
to the rows in such a table. The row ID is a 6-byte field which
monotonically increases as new rows are inserted. Thus the rows
ordered by the row ID will be physically in the insertion order.

</P>
<P>
Accessing a row through the clustered index is fast, because
the row data will be on the same page where the index search
leads us. In many databases the data is traditionally stored on a different
page from the index record. If a table is large, the clustered
index architecture often saves a disk I/O when compared to the
traditional solution.

</P>
<P>
The records in non-clustered indexes (we also call them secondary indexes),
in InnoDB contain the primary key value for the row. InnoDB
uses this primary key value to search for the row from the clustered
index. Note that if the primary key is long, the secondary indexes
will use more space.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_physical_structure" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_physical_structure">7.5.12.1  Physical Structure of an Index</A></H4>

<P>
All indexes in InnoDB are B-trees where the index records are
stored in the leaf pages of the tree. The default size of an index
page is 16 KB. When new records are inserted, InnoDB tries to
leave 1 / 16 of the page free for future insertions and updates
of the index records.

</P>
<P>
If index records are inserted in a sequential (ascending or descending)
order, the resulting index pages will be about 15/16 full.
If records are inserted in a random order, then the pages will be
1/2 - 15/16 full. If the fillfactor of an index page drops below 1/2,
InnoDB will try to contract the index tree to free the page.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Insert_buffering" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Insert_buffering">7.5.12.2  Insert Buffering</A></H4>

<P>
It is a common situation in a database application that the
primary key is a unique identifier and new rows are inserted in the
ascending order of the primary key. Thus the insertions to the
clustered index do not require random reads from a disk.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, secondary indexes are usually non-unique and
insertions happen in a relatively random order into secondary indexes.
This would cause a lot of random disk I/Os without a special mechanism
used in InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
If an index record should be inserted to a non-unique secondary index,
InnoDB checks if the secondary index page is already in the buffer
pool. If that is the case, InnoDB will do the insertion directly to
the index page. But, if the index page is not found from the buffer
pool, InnoDB inserts the record to a special insert buffer structure.
The insert buffer is kept so small that it entirely fits in the buffer
pool, and insertions can be made to it very fast.

</P>
<P>
The insert buffer is periodically merged to the secondary index
trees in the database. Often we can merge several insertions on the
same page in of the index tree, and hence save disk I/Os.
It has been measured that the insert buffer can speed up insertions
to a table up to 15 times.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Adaptive_hash" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Adaptive_hash">7.5.12.3  Adaptive Hash Indexes</A></H4>

<P>
If a database fits almost entirely in main memory, then the fastest way
to perform queries on it is to use hash indexes. InnoDB has an
automatic mechanism which monitors index searches made to the indexes
defined for a table, and if InnoDB notices that queries could
benefit from building of a hash index, such an index is automatically
built.

</P>
<P>
But note that the hash index is always built based on an existing
B-tree index on the table. InnoDB can build a hash index on a prefix
of any length of the key defined for the B-tree, depending on
what search pattern InnoDB observes on the B-tree index.
A hash index can be partial: it is not required that the whole
B-tree index is cached in the buffer pool. InnoDB will build
hash indexes on demand to those pages of the index which are
often accessed.

</P>
<P>
In a sense, through the adaptive hash index mechanism InnoDB adapts itself
to ample main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main memory
databases.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Physical_record" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Physical_record">7.5.12.4  Physical Record Structure</A></H4>


<UL>
<LI>

Each index record in InnoDB contains a header of 6 bytes. The header
is used to link consecutive records together, and also in the row level
locking.
<LI>

Records in the clustered index contain fields for all user-defined
columns. In addition, there is a 6-byte field for the transaction id
and a 7-byte field for the roll pointer.
<LI>

If the user has not defined a primary key for a table, then each clustered
index record contains also a 6-byte row ID field.
<LI>

Each secondary index record contains also all the fields defined
for the clustered index key.
<LI>

A record contains also a pointer to each field of the record.
If the total length of the fields in a record is &#60; 128 bytes, then
the pointer is 1 byte, else 2 bytes.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_auto-increment_column" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_auto-increment_column">7.5.12.5  How an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> Column Works in InnoDB</A></H4>

<P>
After a database startup, when a user first does an insert to a
table <CODE>T</CODE>
where an auto-increment column has been defined, and the user does not provide
an explicit value for the column, then InnoDB executes <CODE>SELECT
MAX(auto-inc-column) FROM T</CODE>, and assigns that value incremented
by one to the column and the auto-increment counter of the table.
We say that
the auto-increment counter for table <CODE>T</CODE> has been initialised.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB follows the same procedure in initialising the auto-increment counter
for a freshly created table.

</P>
<P>
Note that if the user specifies in an insert the value 0 to the auto-increment
column, then InnoDB treats the row like the value would not have been
specified.

</P>
<P>
After the auto-increment counter has been initialised, if a user inserts
a row where he explicitly specifies the column value, and the value is bigger
than the current counter value, then the counter is set to the specified
column value. If the user does not explicitly specify a value, then InnoDB
increments the counter by one and assigns its new value to the column.

</P>
<P>
The auto-increment mechanism, when assigning values from the counter,
bypasses locking and transaction handling. Therefore you may also get
gaps in the number sequence if you roll back transactions which have
got numbers from the counter.

</P>
<P>
The behaviour of auto-increment is not defined if a user gives a negative
value to the column or if the value becomes bigger than the maximum
integer that can be stored in the specified integer type.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="File_space_management" HREF="manual_toc.html#File_space_management">7.5.13  File Space Management and Disk I/O</A></H3>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Disk_I_O" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Disk_I_O">7.5.13.1  Disk I/O</A></H4>

<P>
In disk I/O InnoDB uses asynchronous I/O. On Windows NT
it uses the native asynchronous I/O provided by the operating system.
On Unix, InnoDB uses simulated asynchronous I/O built
into InnoDB: InnoDB creates a number of I/O threads to take care
of I/O operations, such as read-ahead. In a future version we will
add support for simulated aio on Windows NT and native aio on those
versions of Unix which have one.

</P>
<P>
On Windows NT InnoDB uses non-buffered I/O. That means that the disk
pages InnoDB reads or writes are not buffered in the operating system
file cache. This saves some memory bandwidth.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.41 InnoDB uses a novel file flush technique
called doublewrite.
It adds safety to crash recovery after an operating system crash
or a power outage, and improves performance on most Unix flavors
by reducing the need for fsync operations.

</P>
<P>
Doublewrite means that InnoDB before writing pages to a datafile
first writes them to a contiguous tablespace area called the
doublewrite buffer. Only after the write and the flush to the doublewrite
buffer has completed, InnoDB writes the pages to their proper
positions in the datafile. If the operating system crashes in the
middle of a page write, InnoDB will in recovery find a good
copy of the page from the doublewrite buffer.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.41
you can also use a raw disk partition as a datafile, though this has
not been tested yet. When you create a new datafile you have
to put the keyword <CODE>newraw</CODE> immediately after the datafile size
in <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>. The partition must be at least as large
as the size that you specify. Note that 1M in InnoDB is
1024 x 1024 bytes, while in disk specifications 1 MB usually means
1000 000 bytes.

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=/dev/hdd1:5Gnewraw;/dev/hdd2:2Gnewraw
</PRE>

<P>
When you start the database again you <STRONG>must</STRONG> change the keyword
to <CODE>raw</CODE>. Otherwise, InnoDB will write over your
partition!

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=/dev/hdd1:5Graw;/dev/hdd2:2Graw
</PRE>

<P>
By using a raw disk you can on some versions of Unix perform unbuffered I/O.

</P>
<P>
When you use raw disk partitions, make sure they have permissions that
allow read and write access to the account used for running the MySQL
server.

</P>
<P>
There are two read-ahead heuristics in InnoDB: sequential read-ahead
and random read-ahead. In sequential read-ahead InnoDB notices that
the access pattern to a segment in the tablespace is sequential.
Then InnoDB will post in advance a batch of reads of database pages to the
I/O system. In random read-ahead InnoDB notices that some area
in a tablespace seems to be in the process of being
fully read into the buffer pool. Then InnoDB posts the remaining
reads to the I/O system.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_File_space" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_File_space">7.5.13.2  File Space Management</A></H4>

<P>
The datafiles you define in the configuration file form the tablespace
of InnoDB. The files are simply catenated to form the tablespace,
there is no striping in use.
Currently you cannot define where in the tablespace your tables will be
allocated. However, in a newly created
tablespace, InnoDB will allocate space starting from the low end.

</P>
<P>
The tablespace consists of database pages whose default size is 16 KB.
The pages are grouped into extents of 64 consecutive pages. The 'files' inside
a tablespace are called segments in InnoDB. The name of the rollback
segment is somewhat misleading because it actually contains many
segments in the tablespace.

</P>
<P>
For each index in InnoDB we allocate two segments: one is for non-leaf
nodes of the B-tree, the other is for the leaf nodes. The idea here is
to achieve better sequentiality for the leaf nodes, which contain the
data.

</P>
<P>
When a segment grows inside the tablespace, InnoDB allocates the
first 32 pages to it individually. After that InnoDB starts
to allocate whole extents to the segment.
InnoDB can add to a large segment up to 4 extents at a time to ensure
good sequentiality of data.

</P>
<P>
Some pages in the tablespace contain bitmaps of other pages, and
therefore a few extents in an InnoDB tablespace cannot be
allocated to segments as a whole, but only as individual pages.

</P>
<P>
When you issue a query <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM ... LIKE ...</CODE>
to ask for available free space in the tablespace, InnoDB will
report the extents which are definitely free in the tablespace.
InnoDB always reserves some extents for clean-up and other internal
purposes; these reserved extents are not included in the free space.

</P>
<P>
When you delete data from a table, InnoDB will contract the corresponding
B-tree indexes. It depends on the pattern of deletes if that frees
individual pages or extents to the tablespace, so that the freed
space is available for other users. Dropping a table or deleting
all rows from it is guaranteed to release the space to other users,
but remember that deleted rows can be physically removed only in a
purge operation after they are no longer needed in transaction rollback or
consistent read.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_File_Defragmenting" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_File_Defragmenting">7.5.13.3  Defragmenting a Table</A></H4>

<P>
If there are random insertions or deletions
in the indexes of a table, the indexes
may become fragmented. By fragmentation we mean that the physical ordering
of the index pages on the disk is not close to the alphabetical ordering
of the records on the pages, or that there are many unused pages in the
64-page blocks which were allocated to the index.

</P>
<P>
It can speed up index scans if you
periodically use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> to dump the table to
a text file, drop the table, and reload it from the dump.
Another way to do the defragmenting is to
perform a 'null' alter table operation
<CODE>ALTER TABLE tablename TYPE=InnoDB</CODE>.
That makes <CODE>MySQL</CODE> to rebuild the table.

</P>
<P>
If the insertions to an index are always ascending and
records are deleted only from the end, then the file space management
algorithm of InnoDB guarantees that fragmentation in the index will
not occur.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Error_handling" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_handling">7.5.14  Error Handling</A></H3>

<P>
The error handling in InnoDB is not always the same as
specified in the SQL standard. According to SQL-99, any error during
an SQL statement should cause the
rollback of that statement. InnoDB sometimes rolls back only
part of the statement, or the whole transaction.
The following list specifies the error handling of InnoDB.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you run out of file space in the tablespace,
you will get the MySQL <CODE>'Table is full'</CODE> error
and InnoDB rolls back the SQL statement.
<LI>

A transaction deadlock or a timeout in a lock wait make InnoDB
to roll back
the whole transaction.
<LI>

A duplicate key error only rolls back the insert of that particular row,
even in a statement like <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
This will probably change so that the SQL statement will be rolled
back if you have not specified the <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> option in your
statement.
<LI>

A 'row too long' error rolls back the SQL statement.
<LI>

Other errors are mostly detected by the MySQL layer of code, and
they roll back the corresponding SQL statement.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_restrictions" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_restrictions">7.5.15  Restrictions on InnoDB Tables</A></H3>


<UL>

<LI>

InnoDB tables do not support fulltext indexes.

<LI>

In Windows InnoDB stores the database names and table names
internally always in lower case. To move databases in a binary format
from Unix to Windows or from Windows to Unix you should have all table
and database names in lower case.

<LI>

<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> convert MySQL system tables from
MyISAM TO InnoDB tables!  This is not supported; if you do this MySQL
will not restart until you restore the old system tables from a backup
or re-generate them with the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script.

<LI>

<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> does not give accurate statistics
on InnoDB tables, except for the physical size reserved by the table.
The row count is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimisation.

<LI>

If you try to create a unique index on a prefix of a column you will get an
error:


<PRE>
CREATE TABLE T (A CHAR(20), B INT, UNIQUE (A(5))) TYPE = InnoDB;
</PRE>

If you create a non-unique index on a prefix of a column, InnoDB will
create an index over the whole column.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is not supported for InnoDB tables.
<LI>

The MySQL <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> operation does not know of InnoDB
row level locks set in already completed SQL statements: this means that
you can get a table lock on a table even if there still exist transactions
of other users which have row level locks on the same table. Thus
your operations on the table may have to wait if they collide with
these locks of other users. Also a deadlock is possible. However,
this does not endanger transaction integrity, because the row level
locks set by InnoDB will always take care of the integrity.
Also, a table lock prevents other transactions from acquiring more
row level locks (in a conflicting lock mode) on the table.
<LI>

A table cannot contain more than 1000 columns.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM TABLE</CODE> does not regenerate the table but instead
deletes all rows, one by one, which is not that fast. In future versions
of MySQL you can use <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> which is fast.
<LI>

The default database page size in InnoDB is 16 KB. By recompiling the
code one can set it from 8 KB to 64 KB.
The maximun row length is slightly less than half of a database page
in versions &#60;= 3.23.40 of InnoDB. Starting from source
release 3.23.41 BLOB and
TEXT columns are allowed to be &#60; 4 GB, the total row length must also be
&#60; 4 GB. InnoDB does not store fields whose size is &#60;= 128 bytes on separate
pages. After InnoDB has modified the row by storing long fields on
separate pages, the remaining length of the row must be less
than half a database page. The maximun key length is 7000 bytes.
<LI>

On some operating systems datafiles must be &#60; 2 GB. The combined
size of log files must be &#60; 4 GB.
<LI>

The maximum tablespace size is 4 billion database pages. This is also
the maximum size for a table. The minimum tablespace size is 10 MB.
<LI>

When you restart the MySQL server, InnoDB may reuse an old value for
an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column.
<LI>

You cannot set the first <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column value in
InnoDB with <CODE>CREATE TABLE ... AUTO_INCREMENT=...</CODE>
(or <CODE>ALTER TABLE ...</CODE>). To set the value
insert a dummy row with a value one less, and delete that dummy row.

InnoDB now supports the <CODE>SAVEPOINT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</CODE>
SQL statements. See http://www.innodb.com/ibman.html#Savepoints for
the syntax.
<LI>

You can now create column prefix keys like in
<CODE>CREATE TABLE t (a BLOB, INDEX (a(10)))</CODE>.
<LI>

You can also use <CODE>O_DIRECT</CODE> as the <CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> on the
latest versions of Linux and FreeBSD. Beware of possible bugs in those
operating systems, though. 
<LI>

Fixed the checksum calculation of data pages. Previously most OS file
system corruption went unnoticed. Note that if you downgrade from
version &#62;= 4.0.14 to an earlier version &#60; 4.0.14 then in the first
startup(s) InnoDB will print warnings: 

<PRE>
InnoDB: Warning: an inconsistent page in the doublewrite buffer
InnoDB: space id 2552202359 page number 8245, 127'th page in dblwr buf.
</PRE>

but that is not dangerous and can be ignored. 
<LI>

Modified the buffer pool replacement algorithm so that it tries to
flush modified pages if there are no replaceable pages in the last
10 % of the LRU list. This can reduce disk i/o if the workload is
a mixture of reads and writes. 
<LI>

The buffer pool checkpoint flush algorithm now tries to flush also
close neighbors of the page at the end of the flush list. This can
speed up database shutdown, and can also speed up disk writes if
InnoDB log files are very small compared to the buffer pool size. 
<LI>

In 4.0.13 we made <CODE>SHOW INNODB STATUS</CODE> to print detailed info
on the latest <CODE>UNIQUE KEY</CODE> error, but storing that info could
slow down <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> significantly. We no longer store or print
the info. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: <CODE>SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0</CODE> was not replicated properly
in the MySQL replication. The fix will not be backported to 3.23. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: the parameter <CODE>innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct</CODE> forgot to
take into account the free pages in the buffer pool. This could lead
to excessive flushing even though there were lots of free pages in
the buffer pool. Workaround: <CODE>SET GLOBAL
innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = 100</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if there were big index scans then a file read request
could starve and InnoDB could assert because of a very long semaphore wait. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT=1</CODE> then inside <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> MySQL
failed to do the commit after an updating SQL statement if binlogging was
not on, and for <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s did not commit regardless of binlogging state. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: InnoDB could make the index page directory corrupt in the
first B-tree page splits after a mysqld startup. A symptom would be an
assertion in page0page.c, in function page_dir_find_slot(). 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if in a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> with an <CODE>UPDATE CASCADE</CODE>
clause the parent column was of a different internal storage length
than the child column, then a cascaded update would make the column
length wrong in the child table and corrupt the child table. Because
of MySQL's 'silent column specification changes' a fixed-length
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> column can change internally to a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and cause
this error. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if a non-<CODE>latin1</CODE> character set was used and if in a
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> the parent column was of a different internal storage
length than the child column, then all inserts to the child table would
fail in a foreign key error. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: InnoDB could complain that it cannot find the clustered
index record, or in rare cases return an extraneous row if a rollback,
purge, and a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> coincided. 
<LI>

Fixed a possible hang over the btr0sea.c latch if <CODE>SELECT</CODE> was used
inside <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: contrary to what the release note of 4.0.13 said, the
group commit still did not work if the MySQL binlogging was on. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: os_event_wait() did not work properly in Unix, which
might have caused starvation in various log operations. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if a single <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement first managed to delete
some rows and then failed in a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> error or a
'Table is full error', MySQL did not roll back the whole SQL statement
as it should, and also wrote the failed statement to the binlog, reporting
there a non-zero error_code. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: the maximum allowed number of columns in a table is 1000, but

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now supports <CODE>ALTER TABLE DROP FOREIGN KEY</CODE>. You have to use
<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> to find the internally generated foreign key ID
when you want to drop a foreign key. 
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW INNODB STATUS</CODE> now prints detailed information of the latest
detected <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> and <CODE>UNIQUE KEY</CODE> errors. If you do not understand

this statement to study the reason. 
<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> now works also for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> type tables. It makes 10
random dives to each of the index trees and updates index cardinality
estimates accordingly. Note that since it is only an estimate,
repeated runs of <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> may produce different numbers. MySQL
uses index cardinality estimates only in join optimisation. If some
join is not optimised in the right way, you may try using <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>.

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> group commit capability now works also when MySQL
binlogging is switched on. There have to be &#62; 2 client threads

<LI>

Added a new global settable MySQL system variable
<CODE>innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct</CODE>. It is an integer in the range 0 - 100.
The default is 90. The main thread in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tries to flush pages

MySQL also failed to do the next-key locking in the case of an

Fixed a bug: Do not commit the current transaction when a MyISAM
table is updated; this also makes <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> not to commit an
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> transaction, even when binlogging is enabled.

Fixed a bug: We did not allow <CODE>ON DELETE SET NULL</CODE> to modify the same

If the operating system crashes or there is a power outage, then
the setting 2 is no safer than the setting 0.
<LI>

Added checksum fields to log blocks.
<LI>

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 helps in importing tables
in an arbitrary order which does not respect the foreign key rules.
<LI>

SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0 speeds up table imports into InnoDB
if you have UNIQUE constraints on secondary indexes.
This flag should be used only if you are certain that the input records
contain no UNIQUE constraint violations.
<LI>

SHOW TABLE STATUS now lists also possible ON DELETE CASCADE or
ON DELETE SET NULL in the comment field of the table.
<LI>

When CHECK TABLE is run on any InnoDB type table, it now
checks also the adaptive hash index for all tables.
<LI>

If you defined ON DELETE CASCADE or SET NULL and updated the
referenced key in the parent row, InnoDB deleted or updated
the child row. This is now changed to conform to SQL-92: you get
the error 'Cannot delete parent row'.
<LI>

Improved the auto-increment algorithm: now the first insert or
SHOW TABLE STATUS initialises the auto-increment counter for the table.
This removes almost all surprising deadlocks caused by
SHOW TABLE STATUS.
<LI>

Aligned some buffers used in reading and writing to datafiles.
This allows using unbuffered raw devices as datafiles in Linux.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you updated the primary key of a table so that only the
case of characters changed, that could cause assertion
failures, mostly in page0page.ic line 515.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you delete or update a row referenced in a foreign key
constraint and the foreign key check has to wait for a lock,
then the check may report an erroneous result. This
affects also the ON DELETE... operation.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: A deadlock or a lock wait timeout error in InnoDB
causes InnoDB to roll back the whole transaction, but MySQL could still
write the earlier SQL statements to the binlog, even though
InnoDB rolled them back. This could, for example, cause replicated
databases to get out-of-sync.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If the database happened to crash in the middle of a
commit, then the recovery might leak tablespace pages.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you specified a non-latin1 character set in my.cnf,
then, in contrary to what is stated in the manual, in a foreign key
constraint a string type column had to have the same length specification
in the referencing table and the referenced table.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: DROP TABLE or DROP DATABASE could fail if there
simultaneously was a CREATE TABLE running.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you configured the buffer pool bigger than 2 GB in
a 32-bit computer, InnoDB would assert in buf0buf.ic line 214.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: on 64-bit computers updating rows which contained the
SQL NULL in some column could cause the undo log and the ordinary
log to become corrupt.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: innodb_log_monitor caused a hang if it suppressed
lock prints for a page.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: in the HP-UX-10.20 version mutexes would leak and cause
race conditions and crashes in any part of InnoDB code.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if you ran in the AUTOCOMMIT mode, executed a SELECT,
and immediately after that a RENAME TABLE, then RENAME would fail and
MySQL would complain about error 1192.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if compiled on 64-bit Solaris, InnoDB produced a bus error
at startup.

InnoDB is essentially the same as InnoDB-3.23.51.
<LI>

If no innodb_data_file_path is specified, InnoDB at the database creation
now creates a 10 MB auto-extending datafile ibdata1 to the datadir
of MySQL. In 4.0.1 the file was 64 MB and not auto-extending.

<UL>
<LI>

InnoDB now supports an auto-extending last datafile. You do not need
to preallocate the whole datafile at the database startup.
<LI>

Made several changes to facilitate the use of the InnoDB Hot Backup
tool. It is a separate non-free tool you can use to take online backups
of your database without shutting down the server or setting
any locks.
<LI>

If you want to run the InnoDB Hot Backup tool on an auto-extending
datafile you have to upgrade it to version ibbackup-0.35.
<LI>

The log scan phase in crash recovery will now run much faster.
<LI>

Starting from this server version, the hot backup tool
truncates unused ends in the backup InnoDB datafiles.
<LI>

To allow the hot backup tool to work, on Windows we no longer use
unbuffered I/O or native async I/O; instead we use the same simulated
async I/O as on Unix.
<LI>

You can now define the ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL
clause on foreign keys.
<LI>

FOREIGN KEY constraints now survive ALTER TABLE and CREATE
INDEX.
<LI>

We suppress the FOREIGN KEY check if any of the column values in the
foreign key or referenced key to be checked is the SQL NULL. This
is compatible with Oracle, for example.
<LI>

SHOW CREATE TABLE now lists also foreign key constraints. Also
mysqldump no longer forgets about foreign keys in table definitions.
<LI>

You can now add a new foreign key constraint with
ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ... (...).
<LI>

FOREIGN KEY definitions now allow backquotes around table and
column names.
<LI>

MySQL command
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...
has now the following effect on
InnoDB tables: if a transaction is defined as SERIALIZABLE
then InnoDB conceptually adds LOCK IN SHARE MODE
to all consistent reads. If a transaction is defined to have any other
isolation level, then InnoDB obeys its default locking strategy
which is REPEATABLE READ.
<LI>

SHOW TABLE STATUS no longer sets an x-lock at the end of an
auto-increment index if the auto-increment counter has already
been initialised. This removes in almost all cases the surprising deadlocks
caused by SHOW TABLE STATUS.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: in a CREATE TABLE statement the string 'foreign'
followed by a non-space character confused the FOREIGN KEY parser
and caused table creation to fail with errno 150.

Fixed a bug: if you called DROP DATABASE for a database on which
there simultaneously were running queries, the MySQL server could crash
or hang. Crashes fixed, but a full fix has to wait some changes
in the MySQL layer of code.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: on Windows one had to put the database name
in lower case for DROP
DATABASE to work. Fixed in 3.23.49: case no longer matters
on Windows. On Unix the database name remains case-sensitive.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if one defined a non-latin1 character set as
the default character set,
then definition of foreign key constraints could fail
in an assertion failure
in dict0crea.c, reporting an internal error 17.

<UL>
<LI>

Tuned the SQL optimiser to favor more often index searches
over table scans.
<LI>

Fixed a performance problem when several large SELECT
queries are run concurrently on a multiprocessor Linux computer.
Large CPU-bound SELECT queries will now also generally run faster on
all platforms.
<LI>

If MySQL binlogging is used,
InnoDB now prints after crash recovery the latest MySQL binlog
file name and the position in that file (= byte offset)
InnoDB was able to recover to. This is useful, for example,
when resynchronizing a master and a slave database in replication.
<LI>

Added better error messages to help in installation problems.
<LI>

One can now recover also MySQL temporary tables which have become
orphaned inside the InnoDB tablespace.
<LI>

InnoDB now prevents a FOREIGN KEY declaration where the signedness
is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: calling SHOW CREATE TABLE or SHOW TABLE STATUS
could cause memory corruption and make mysqld to crash.
Especially at risk was mysqldump, because it calls frequently
SHOW CREATE TABLE.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if on Unix you did an ALTER TABLE to an InnoDB table and
simultaneously did queries to it, mysqld could crash with an assertion
failure in row0row.c, line 474.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if inserts to several tables containing an auto-inc column
were wrapped inside one LOCK TABLES, InnoDB asserted in lock0lock.c.
<LI>

In 3.23.47 we allowed several NULLS in a UNIQUE secondary index.
But CHECK TABLE was not relaxed: it reports the table as corrupt.
CHECK TABLE no longer complains in this situation.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: on Sparc and other high-endian processors SHOW VARIABLES
showed innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit and other boolean-valued
startup parameters always OFF even if they were switched on. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if you ran mysqld-max-nt as a service on Windows NT/2000,
the service shutdown did not always wait long enough for the InnoDB shutdown

<UL>
<LI>

Recovery happens now faster, especially in a lightly loaded system,
because background checkpointing has been made more frequent.
<LI>

InnoDB allows now several similar key values in a UNIQUE secondary index
if those values contain SQL NULLs. Thus the convention is now the same as in
MyISAM tables.
<LI>

InnoDB gives a better row count estimate for a table which contains BLOBs.
<LI>

In a FOREIGN KEY constraint InnoDB is now case-insensitive to column
names, and in Windows also to table names.
<LI>

InnoDB allows a FOREIGN KEY column of CHAR type to refer to a column of
VARCHAR type, and vice versa. MySQL silently changes the type of some
columns between CHAR and VARCHAR, and these silent changes do not hinder
FOREIGN KEY declaration any more.
<LI>

Recovery has been made more resilient to corruption of log files.
<LI>

Unnecessary statistics calculation has been removed from queries which
generate a temporary table. Some ORDER BY and DISTINCT queries will now run
much faster.
<LI>

MySQL now knows that the table scan of an InnoDB table is done through the
primary key. This will save a sort in some ORDER BY queries.
<LI>

The maximum key length of InnoDB tables is again restricted to 500 bytes.
The MySQL interpreter is not able to handle longer keys.
<LI>

The default value of innodb_lock_wait_timeout was changed from infinite to
50 seconds, the default value of innodb_file_io_threads from 9

This is a bugfix release.
<LI>

In versions 3.23.42-.44 when creating a table on Windows you
have to use lower case letters in the database name to be able to
access the table. Fixed in 3.23.45.
<LI>

InnoDB now flushes stdout and stderr every 10 seconds: if these
are redirected to files, the file contents can be better viewed with
an editor.
<LI>

Fixed an assertion failure in .44, in trx0trx.c, line 178
when you drop a table which has
the .frm file but does not exist inside InnoDB.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the insert buffer.
The insert buffer tree could get into an inconsistent state, causing a crash,
and also crashing the recovery. This bug could appear especially in
large table imports or alterations.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in recovery: InnoDB could go into an infinite loop
constantly printing
a warning message that it cannot find free blocks from the buffer pool.

Fixed a bug: when you created a temporary table of the InnoDB type, and then
used ALTER TABLE to it, the MySQL server could crash.

<LI>

Improved InnoDB monitors, including a new innodb_table_monitor
which allows you to print the contents of the InnoDB internal data
dictionary.
<LI>

DROP DATABASE will now work also for InnoDB tables.
<LI>

Accent characters in the default character set
latin1 will be ordered according to the MySQL ordering.&#60;br&#62;
NOTE: if you are using latin1 and have inserted characters
whose code is &#62; 127 to an indexed CHAR column, you should run
CHECK TABLE on your table when you upgrade to
3.23.43, and drop and reimport the table if CHECK TABLE
reports an error!
<LI>

InnoDB will calculate better table cardinality
estimates.
<LI>

Change in deadlock resolution:
in .43 a deadlock rolls back only the
SQL statement, in .44 it will roll back the whole transaction.
<LI>

Deadlock, lock wait timeout, and foreign key
constraint violations (no parent row, child rows exist)
now return native MySQL
error codes 1213, 1205, 1216, 1217, respectively.
<LI>

A new my.cnf parameter innodb_thread_concurrency
helps in performance tuning in high concurrency environments.
<LI>

A new my.cnf option innodb_force_recovery will
help you in dumping tables from a corrupted database.

A new my.cnf option innodb_fast_shutdown will
speed up shutdown. Normally InnoDB does a full purge

<H3><A NAME="BDB_overview" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_overview">7.6.1  Overview of <CODE>BDB</CODE> Tables</A></H3>

<P>
BerkeleyDB, available at <a HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">http://www.sleepycat.com/</a> has provided
MySQL with a transactional storage engine. Support for this storage engine is
included in the MySQL source distribution starting from version 3.23.34 and is
activated in the MySQL-Max binary. This storage engine is typically called
<CODE>BDB</CODE> for short.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables may have a greater chance of surviving crashes and are also
capable of <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> operations on transactions.
The MySQL source distribution comes with a <CODE>BDB</CODE> distribution that has a
couple of small patches to make it work more smoothly with MySQL.
You can't use a non-patched <CODE>BDB</CODE> version with MySQL.

</P>
<P>
We at MySQL AB are working in close cooperation with Sleepycat to
keep the quality of the MySQL/BDB interface high.

</P>
<P>
When it comes to supporting <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, we are committed to help our
users to locate the problem and help creating a reproducible test case
for any problems involving <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.  Any such test case will be
forwarded to Sleepycat who in turn will help us find and fix the
problem.  As this is a two-stage operation, any problems with <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables
may take a little longer for us to fix than for other storage engines.
However, as the BerkeleyDB code itself has been used by many other
applications than MySQL, we don't envision any big problems with
this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.4.1  Support Offered by MySQL AB</A>.

</P>

<P>
If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes
support for BerkeleyDB, simply follow the instructions for installing a
binary version of MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.11  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
To compile MySQL with Berkeley DB support, download MySQL
Version 3.23.34 or newer and configure <CODE>MySQL</CODE> with the
<CODE>--with-berkeley-db</CODE> option.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.

<P>
Please refer to the manual provided with the <CODE>BDB</CODE> distribution for
more updated information.

<P>
Even though Berkeley DB is in itself very tested and reliable,
the MySQL interface is still considered gamma quality.
We are actively improving and optimising it to get it stable very
soon.

to create a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, MySQL will instead create a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.

</P>
<P>
Normally you should start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> without <CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE> if you
intend to use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.  This may, however, give you problems when you
try to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> if the <CODE>BDB</CODE> log files are corrupted. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
With <CODE>bdb_max_lock</CODE> you can specify the maximum number of locks
(10000 by default) you can have active on a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table. You should
increase this if you get errors of type <CODE>bdb: Lock table is out of
available locks</CODE> or <CODE>Got error 12 from ...</CODE>  when you have do long
transactions or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has to examine a lot of rows to
calculate the query.

</P>
<P>
You may also want to change <CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE> and
<CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE> if you are using big multi-line transactions.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE>, <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<H3><A NAME="BDB_characteristics" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_characteristics">7.6.4  Characteristics of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables:</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

To be able to rollback transactions, the <CODE>BDB</CODE> storage engine maintains
log files.  For maximum performance you should place these on another disk
than your databases by using the <CODE>--bdb-logdir</CODE> option.
<LI>

MySQL performs a checkpoint each time a new <CODE>BDB</CODE> log
file is started, and removes any log files that are not needed for
current transactions.  One can also run <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> at any time
to checkpoint the Berkeley DB tables.

For disaster recovery, one should use table backups plus
MySQL's binary log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: If you delete old log files that are in use, <CODE>BDB</CODE> will
not be able to do recovery at all and you may lose data if something
goes wrong.
<LI>

MySQL requires a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in each <CODE>BDB</CODE> table to be
able to refer to previously read rows. If you don't create one,
MySQL will create an maintain a hidden <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> for
you.  The hidden key has a length of 5 bytes and is incremented for each
insert attempt.
<LI>

If all columns you access in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table are part of the same index or
part of the primary key, then MySQL can execute the query
without having to access the actual row.  In a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table the
above holds only if the columns are part of the same index.
<LI>

The <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> will be faster than any other key, as the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> is stored together with the row data.  As the other keys are
stored as the key data + the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, it's important to keep the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> as short as possible to save disk and get better speed.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> works on <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables as with other tables.  If
you don't use <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE>, MySQL will issue an internal
multiple-write lock on the table to ensure that the table will be
properly locked if another thread issues a table lock.
<LI>

Internal locking in <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables is done on page level.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name</CODE> is slow as <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables doesn't
maintain a count of the number of rows in the table.
<LI>

Sequential scanning is slower than with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as the data in
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables stored in B-trees and not in a separate datafile.
<LI>

The application must always be prepared to handle cases where
any change of a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table may make an automatic rollback and any
read may fail with a deadlock error.
<LI>

Keys are not prefix or suffix-compressed like keys in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables. In other words, the key information will take a little more
space in <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables compared to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

There are often holes in the <CODE>BDB</CODE> table to allow you to insert new rows in
the middle of the key tree.  This makes <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables somewhat larger than
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

The optimiser needs to know an approximation of the number of rows in
the table.  MySQL solves this by counting inserts and
maintaining this in a separate segment in each <CODE>BDB</CODE> table.  If you don't
issue a lot of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statements, this number
should be accurate enough for the MySQL optimiser, but as MySQL
only stores the number on close, it may be incorrect if MySQL dies
unexpectedly. It should not be fatal even if this number is not 100%
correct.  One can update the number of rows by executing <CODE>ANALYZE
TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> . See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

If you get full disk with a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, you will get an error
(probably error 28) and the transaction should roll back.  This is in
contrast with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
wait for enough free disk before continuing.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="BDB_TODO" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_TODO">7.6.5  Things we need to fix for <CODE>BDB</CODE> in the near future:</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

It's very slow to open many <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables at the same time. If you are
going to use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should not have a very big table cache
(like &#62;256) and you should use <CODE>--no-auto-rehash</CODE> with the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
client.  We plan to partly fix this in 4.0.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> doesn't yet provide that much information for
<CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.
<LI>

Optimise performance.
<LI>

Change to not use page locks at all when we are scanning tables.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="BDB_portability" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_portability">7.6.6  Operating systems supported by <CODE>BDB</CODE></A></H3>

This means that <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables are not supported for your architecture.
In this case you must rebuild MySQL without <CODE>BDB</CODE> table support.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="BDB_restrictions" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_restrictions">7.6.7  Restrictions on <CODE>BDB</CODE> Tables</A></H3>

<P>
Here follows the restrictions you have when using <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables store in the <TT>`.db'</TT> file the path to the file as it was
created.
(This was done to be able to detect locks in a multi-user environment that
supports symlinks).

The effect of this is that <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables are not movable between directories!
<LI>

When taking backups of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you have to either use
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> or take a backup of all <CODE>table_name.db</CODE> files and
the <CODE>BDB</CODE> log files.  The <CODE>BDB</CODE> log files are the files in the base
data directory named <CODE>log.XXXXXXXXXX</CODE> (ten digits);
The <CODE>BDB</CODE> storage engine stores unfinished transactions in the log files
and requires these logs to be present when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts.

If you get the following error in the <CODE>hostname.err log</CODE> when
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>:


<PRE>
bdb:  Ignoring log file: .../log.XXXXXXXXXX: unsupported log version #
</PRE>

it means that the new <CODE>BDB</CODE> version doesn't support the old log
file format.  In this case you have to delete all <CODE>BDB</CODE> logs
from your database directory (the files with names that have the format
<CODE>log.XXXXXXXXXX</CODE>) and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  We would also
recommend you to do a <CODE>mysqldump --opt</CODE> of your old <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables, delete the old tables, and restore the dump.
<LI>

If you are not running in auto-commit mode and delete a table that is referenced
in another transaction, you may get the following error messages in your MySQL
error log:


<PRE>
001119 23:43:56  bdb:  Missing log fileid entry
001119 23:43:56  bdb:  txn_abort: Log undo failed for LSN:
                       1 3644744: Invalid

This is not fatal but we don't recommend that you delete tables if you are
not in auto-commit mode, until this problem is fixed (the fix is
not trivial).

<H1><A NAME="MaxDB" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB">8  Introduction to MaxDB</A></H1>

<P>
MaxDB is an enterprise level database. MaxDB is the new name of a database management system formerly called SAP DB.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="MaxDB_History" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB_History">8.1  History of MaxDB</A></H2>

<P>
The  history of SAP DB goes back to the early 1980s when it was
developed as a commercial product (Adabas). The database has changed
names several times since then. When SAP AG, a Walldorf, Germany,
based company, took over the development of that database system,
it was called SAP DB.

</P>
<P>
SAP developed that database system to serve as a storage system
for all heavy-duty SAP applications, namely R/3. SAP DB was meant
to provide an alternative to third-party database systems like
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2 by IBM. In October 2000, SAP
AG released SAP DB under the GNU GPL license (see section <A HREF="manual.html#GPL_license">H  GNU General Public License</A>), 
thus making it open source software. In October 2003, more than 2,000 
customers of SAP AG were using SAP DB as their main database system, 
and more than another 2,000 customers were using it as a separate 
database system besides their main database, as part of the 
APO/LiveCache solution.

</P>
<P>
In May 2003, a technology partnership was formed between MySQL AB
and SAP AG. That partnership entitles MySQL AB to further develop SAP
DB, rename it, and sell commercial licenses of the renamed SAP DB
to customers who do not want to be bound to the restrictions imposed
to them when using that database system under the GNU GPL (see section <A HREF="manual.html#GPL_license">H  GNU General Public License</A>). In August 2003, SAP DB was renamed to MaxDB by MySQL AB.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="MaxDB_Licensing" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB_Licensing">8.2  Licensing and Support</A></H2>

<P>
MaxDB can be used under the same licenses available for the other
products distributed by MySQL AB (section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_licenses">1.4.3  MySQL Licenses</A>). Thus,
MaxDB will be available under the GNU General Public License
(section <A HREF="manual.html#GPL_license">H  GNU General Public License</A>), and a commercial license (section <A HREF="manual.html#Licensing_and_Support">1.4  MySQL Support and Licensing</A>).

</P>
<P>
MySQL will offer MaxDB support to non-SAP customers.

</P>
<P>
The first rebranded version will be MaxDB 7.5.00 that will be
released in late 2003.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="MaxDB_Basics" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB_Basics">8.3  Basic Concepts of MaxDB</A></H2>

<P>
MaxDB operates as a client/server product. It was developed to meet
the demands of installations processing a high volume of online
transactions. Both online backup and expansion of the database are
supported. Microsoft Clustered Server is supported directly for
multiple server implementations; other failover solutions must be
scripted manually. Database management tools are provided in both
Windows and browser-based implementations.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="MaxDB-MySQL_Differences" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB-MySQL_Differences">8.4  Feature Differences between MaxDB and MySQL</A></H2>

<P>
The following list provides a short summary of the main differences
between MaxDB and MySQL; it is not complete.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MaxDB runs as a client/server system. MySQL can run as a client/server system
or as an embedded system.
<LI>

MaxDB might not run on all platforms supported by MySQL. For example,
MaxDB does not run on IBM's OS/2.
<LI>

MaxDB uses a proprietary network protocol for client/server
communication, while MySQL uses either TCP/IP (with or without SSL
encryption), sockets (under Unix-like systems), or named pipes
(under Windows NT-family systems).
<LI>

MaxDB supports stored procedures. For MySQL, stored procedures are
not scheduled for implementation until version 5.0. MaxDB also supports
programming of
triggers through an SQL extension, which is scheduled for MySQL
5.1. MaxDB contains a debugger for stored procedure languages,
can cascade nested triggers, and supports multiple triggers per
action and row.
<LI>

MaxDB is distributed containing user interfaces that are text-based,
graphical, or web-based. MySQL is distributed with text-based user
interfaces only; a graphical user interface (MySQL Control Center)
is shipped separately from the main distributions. Web-based user
interfaces for MySQL are offered by third parties.
<LI>

MaxDB supports a number of programming interfaces also supported
by MySQL. However, MaxDB does not support RDO, ADO, or .NET, all of which are
supported by MySQL. MaxDB
supports embedded SQL only with C/C++.
<LI>

MaxDB contains administrative features that MySQL does not have:
Job scheduling by time, event, and alert, and sending
messages to a database administrator on alert thresholds.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="MaxDB-MySQL_Interoperability" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB-MySQL_Interoperability">8.5  Interoperability Features between MaxDB and MySQL</A></H2>

<P>
The following features will be included in MaxDB versions to be
released shortly after the first 7.5.00 version. These features
will allow interoperation between MaxDB and MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There will be a MySQL proxy enabling one to connect to MaxDB using
the MySQL protocol. This makes it possible to use MySQL client
programs for MaxDB, like the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line user interface,
the <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> dump utility, or the <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> import
program. Using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, one can easily dump data from one
database system and export (or even pipe) those data to the other
database system.
<LI>

Replication between MySQL and MaxDB will be supported in both
directions. That is, either MySQL or MaxDB can be used as the master
replication server. The long-range plan is to converge and extend the
replication syntax so that both database systems understand the same syntax.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Intro">4.10.1  Introduction</A>.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="MaxDB_Links" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB_Links">8.6  MaxDB-related Links</A></H2>

<P>
The main page for information about MaxDB is
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/maxdb">http://www.mysql.com/maxdb</a>. Eventually, all information
available at <a HREF="http://www.sapdb.org">http://www.sapdb.org</a> will be moved there.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="MaxDB_Reserved_Words" HREF="manual_toc.html#MaxDB_Reserved_Words">8.7  Reserved Words in MaxDB</A></H2>

<P>
Like MySQL, MaxDB has a number of reserved words that have special meanings.
Normally, they cannot be used
as names of identifiers, such as database or table names. The following
table lists reserved words in MaxDB, indicates the context in which
those words are used, and indicates whether or not they have
counterparts in MySQL. If such a counterpart exists, the meaning
in MySQL might be identical, or differing in some aspects. The main
purpose is to list in which respects MaxDB differs from MySQL;
therefore, this list is not complete.

Improved handling of character sets is one of the features added to
MySQL in Version 4.1. This chapter explains:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>What are character sets and collations

<LI>The multi-level default system

<LI>New syntax in MySQL 4.1

<LI>Affected functions and operations

<LI>The meaning of each individual character set and collation

</UL>

<P>
The features described here are as implemented in MySQL 4.1.1.
(MySQL 4.1.0 has some but not all of these features, and some of them
are implemented differently.)

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Charset-general" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-general">9.1  Character Sets and Collations in General</A></H2>

<P>
A <STRONG>character set</STRONG> is a set of symbols and encodings. A <STRONG>collation</STRONG> is a set of rules for comparing characters in a
character set. Let's make the distinction clear with an example of
an imaginary character set.

</P>

<P>
Suppose we had an alphabet with four letters: <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`b'</SAMP>. We give each letter a number: <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> = 0, <SAMP>`B'</SAMP> = 1, <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> =
2, <SAMP>`c'</SAMP> =
3. The letter <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> is a symbol, the number 0 is the <STRONG>encoding</STRONG>
for <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, and the combination of all four letters and their
encodings is a <STRONG>character set</STRONG>.

</P>

<P>
Now, suppose we want to compare two string values, <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>.
The simplest way to do this is to look at the encodings -- 0 for
<SAMP>`A'</SAMP> and 1 for <SAMP>`B'</SAMP> -- and because 0 is less than 1, we say <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> is less
than <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>. Now, what we've just done is apply a collation to our
character set. The collation is a set of rules (only one rule in
this case): ``compare the encodings''. We call this simplest of all
possible collations a <STRONG>binary</STRONG> collation.

</P>

<P>
But what if we want to say that the lowercase and uppercase
letters are equivalent? Then we would have at least two rules: (1)
treat the lowercase letters <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`b'</SAMP> as equivalent to <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`B'</SAMP>; (2) then compare the encodings. We call this a <STRONG>case
insensitive</STRONG> collation. It's a little more complex than a binary
collation.

</P>

<P>
In real life, most character sets have many characters: not just
<SAMP>`A'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`B'</SAMP> but whole alphabets, sometimes multiple alphabets or
eastern writing systems with thousands of characters, along with
many special symbols and punctuation marks. Also in real life, most
collations have many rules: not just case insensitivity but also
accent insensitivity (an ``accent'' is a mark attached to a character
as in German <SAMP>`@"O'</SAMP>) and multiple-character mappings (such as the
rule that <SAMP>`@"O'</SAMP> = <SAMP>`OE'</SAMP> in one of the two German collations).

</P>
<P>
MySQL 4.1 can do these things for you:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Store strings using a variety of character sets

<LI>Compare strings using a variety of collations

<LI>Mix strings with different character sets or collations in the

same server, the same database, or even the same table
<LI>Allow specification of character set and collation at any

level

</UL>

<P>
In these respects, not only is MySQL 4.1 far more flexible than
MySQL 4.0, it also is far ahead of other DBMSs. However, to use the
new features effectively, you will need to learn what character
sets and collations are available, how to change their defaults,
and what the various string operators do with them.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Charset-MySQL" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-MySQL">9.2  Character Sets and Collations in MySQL</A></H2>

<P>
A character set always has at least one collation. It may have
several collations.

</P>
<P>
For example, character set <CODE>latin1</CODE> (``ISO-8859-1 West
European'') has the following collations:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<TR><TD><STRONG>Collation</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>latin1_bin</CODE> </TD><TD> Binary according to <CODE>latin1</CODE> encoding

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>latin1_general_ci</CODE> </TD><TD> Multilingual

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Notes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Two different character sets can't have the same

collation.
<LI>Each character set has one collation that is the <EM>default

collation</EM>. For example, the default collation for <CODE>latin1</CODE> is
<CODE>latin1_swedish_ci</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
Notice that there is a convention for collation names: They start
with the name of the character set they are associated with, they
usually include a language name, and they end with <CODE>_ci</CODE> (case
insensitive), <CODE>_cs</CODE> (case sensitive), or <CODE>_bin</CODE> (binary).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Charset-defaults" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-defaults">9.3  Determining the Default Character Set and Collation</A></H2>

<P>
There are default settings for character sets and collations at
four levels: server, database, table, connection. The following
description may appear complex, but it's been found in practice
that multi-level defaulting leads to natural and obvious
results.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-server" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-server">9.3.1  Server Character Set and Collation</A></H3>

<P>
The MySQL Server has a server character set and a server collation,
which may not be null.

</P>
<P>
MySQL determines the server character set and server collation
thus:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>According to the option settings in effect when the server starts up.

</UL>

<P>
At this level, the decision is simple. The server character set
and collation depend on the options that you use when you start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. You can use <CODE>--default-character-set=character_set_name</CODE>
for the character set, and along with it you can add
<CODE>--default-collation=collation_name</CODE> for the collation. If you
don't specify a character set, that is the same as saying
<CODE>--default-character-set=latin1</CODE>. If you specify only a character
set (for instance, <CODE>latin1</CODE>) but not a collation, that is the same as
saying <CODE>--default-charset=latin1</CODE> <CODE>--collation=latin1_swedish_ci</CODE>
because <CODE>latin1_swedish_ci</CODE> is the default collation for <CODE>latin1</CODE>.
Therefore the following three commands all have the same effect:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld
shell&#62; mysqld --default-character-set=latin1
shell&#62; mysqld --default-character-set=latin1
           --default-collation=latin1_swedish_ci
</PRE>

<P>
One way to change the settings is by recompiling. If you want to
change the default server character set and collation when building
from sources, use: <CODE>--with-character-set</CODE> and <CODE>--with-collation</CODE>
as arguments for <CODE>configure</CODE>. For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-character-set=latin1
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-character-set=latin1
           --with-collation=latin1_german1_ci
</PRE>

<P>
Both <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and <CODE>configure</CODE> check that
the character set/collation combination is valid. Each program displays
an error message and terminates if the combination is not valid.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-database" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-database">9.3.2  Database Character Set and Collation</A></H3>

<P>
Every database has a database character set and a database
collation, which may not be null. The <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> and <CODE>ALTER
DATABASE</CODE> commands now have optional clauses for specifying the
database character set and collation:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE DATABASE db_name
   [CHARACTER SET character_set_name [COLLATE collation_name]]

ALTER DATABASE db_name
    [CHARACTER SET character_set_name [COLLATE collation_name]]
</PRE>

<P>
Example:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE DATABASE db_name
   CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL chooses the database character set and database collation
thus:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>If both <CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE> and <CODE>COLLATE Y</CODE> were specified, then

character set <CODE>X</CODE> and collation <CODE>Y</CODE>.
<LI>If <CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE> was specified without <CODE>COLLATE</CODE>, then

character set <CODE>X</CODE> and its default collation.
<LI>Otherwise, the server character set and server collation.

</UL>

<P>
MySQL's <CODE>CREATE DATABASE ... CHARACTER SET ...</CODE> syntax is
analogous to the standard-SQL <CODE>CREATE SCHEMA ... CHARACTER SET ...</CODE>
syntax. Because of this, it is possible to create databases with
different character sets and collations, on the same MySQL
server.

</P>

<P>
The database character set and collation are used as default
values if the table character set and collation are not specified
in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statements. They have no other purpose.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-table" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-table">9.3.3  Table Character Set and Collation</A></H3>

<P>
Every table has a table character set and a table collation, which
may not be null. The <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statements now
have optional clauses for specifying the table character set and
collation:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE table_name ( column_list )
   [CHARACTER SET character_set_name [COLLATE collation_name]]

ALTER TABLE table_name
   [CHARACTER SET character_set_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
</PRE>

<P>
Example:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 ( ... ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL chooses the table character set and collation thus:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>If both <CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE> and <CODE>COLLATE Y</CODE> were specified, then

character set <CODE>X</CODE> and collation <CODE>Y</CODE>.
<LI>If <CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE> was specified without <CODE>COLLATE</CODE>, then

character set <CODE>X</CODE> and its default collation.
<LI>Otherwise, the database character set and collation.

</UL>

<P>
The table character set and collation are used as default
values, if the column character set and collation are not specified
in individual column definitions. The table character set and
collation are MySQL extensions; there are no such things in
standard SQL.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-column" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-column">9.3.4  Column Character Set and Collation</A></H3>

<P>
Every ``character'' column (that is, a column of type <CODE>CHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>) has a column character set and a column
collation, which may not be null. Column definition syntax now has optional
clauses for specifying the column character set and collation:

</P>

<PRE>
column_name {CHAR | VARCHAR | TEXT} (column_length)
    [CHARACTER SET character_set_name [COLLATE collation_name]]
</PRE>

<P>
Example:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE Table1
(
   column1 VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
);
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL chooses the column character set and collation thus:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>If both <CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE> and <CODE>COLLATE Y</CODE> were specified, then

character set <CODE>X</CODE> and collation <CODE>Y</CODE>.
<LI>If <CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE> was specified without <CODE>COLLATE</CODE>, then

character set <CODE>X</CODE> and its default collation.
<LI>Otherwise, the table character set and collation.

</UL>

<P>
The <CODE>CHARACTER SET</CODE> and <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> clauses are standard SQL.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-examples" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-examples">9.3.5  Examples of Character Set and Collation Assignment</A></H3>

<P>
The following examples show how MySQL determines default character set and
collation values.

</P>

<H4>9.3.5.1  Example 1: Table + Column Definition</H4>


<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1
(
  c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
) CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_bin;
</PRE>

<P>
Here you have a column with a <CODE>latin1</CODE> character set
and a <CODE>latin1_german1_ci</CODE> collation. The definition is explicit, so
that's straightforward. Notice that there's no problem storing a
<CODE>latin1</CODE> column in a <CODE>latin2</CODE> table.

</P>

<H4>9.3.5.2  Example 2: Table + Column Definition</H4>


<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1
(
   c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1
) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
</PRE>

<P>
This time we have a column with a <CODE>latin1</CODE> character
set and a default collation. Now, although it might seem natural,
the default collation is not taken from the table level. Instead,
because the default collation for <CODE>latin1</CODE> is always
<CODE>latin1_swedish_ci</CODE>,
column <CODE>c1</CODE> will have a collation of <CODE>latin1_swedish_ci</CODE> (not
<CODE>latin1_danish_ci</CODE>).

</P>

<H4>9.3.5.3  Example 3: Table + Column Definition</H4>


<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1
(
   c1 CHAR(10)
) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
</PRE>

<P>
We have a column with a default character set and
a default collation. In this circumstance, MySQL looks up to the
table level for inspiration in determining the column character set and
collation. So the character set for column <CODE>c1</CODE> is
<CODE>latin1</CODE> and its collation is <CODE>latin1_danish_ci</CODE>.

</P>

<H4>9.3.5.4  Example 4: Database + Table + Column Definition</H4>


<PRE>
CREATE DATABASE d1 CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_czech_ci;
USE d1;
CREATE TABLE t1
(
   c1 CHAR(10)
);
</PRE>

<P>
We create a column without specifying its
character set and collation. We're also not specifying a character
set and a collation at the table level. In this circumstance, MySQL
looks up to the database level for inspiration. (The database's
settings become the table's settings, and thereafter become the
column's setting.) So the character set for column <CODE>c1</CODE> is <CODE>latin2</CODE>
and its collation is <CODE>latin2_czech_ci</CODE>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-connection" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-connection">9.3.6  Connection Character Sets and Collations</A></H3>

<P>
Every connection has connection character sets and connection
collations, which may not be null. There are actually two
connection character sets, which we will call ``connection/literals'' and
``connection/results'' when it is necessary to distinguish them.

</P>
<P>
Consider what a ``connection'' is: It's what you make when you
connect to the server. The client sends SQL statements, such as queries, over the
connection to the server. The server sends responses, such as
result sets, over the connection back to the client. This leads to
several questions, such as: (a) what character set is the query
in when it leaves the client? (b) what character set should the
server translate a query to after receiving it? (c) what character
set should the server translate to before shipping result sets or
error messages back to the client? You can fine-tune the setting
for these things, or you can depend on the defaults (in which case,
you can skip this section).

</P>

<P>
There are two statements that affect the connection character
sets:

</P>

<PRE>
SET NAMES character_set_name
SET CHARACTER SET character_set_name
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>SET NAMES</CODE> indicates what is in the SQL statement that the client
sends. Thus, <CODE>SET NAMES cp1251</CODE> tells the server ``future
incoming messages from this client will be in character set <CODE>cp1251</CODE>''
and the server is free to translate to its own character set, if
appropriate.

</P>

<P>
<CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> indicates what is in the SQL statement that
the client sends, and also what is in the result set that the
server sends back to the client. Thus, <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> includes
<CODE>SET NAMES</CODE>, and also specifies what character set the column values
will have if, for example, you use a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

</P>

<P>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that <CODE>column1</CODE> is defined as <CODE>CHAR(5)
CHARACTER SET latin2</CODE>.  If you do not say <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE>,
then for <CODE>SELECT column1 FROM t</CODE> the server will send back all
the values for <CODE>column1</CODE> using character set <CODE>latin2</CODE>. If on
the other hand you say <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET latin1</CODE> then the server
will, just before sending back, convert the <CODE>latin2</CODE> values to
<CODE>latin1</CODE>. Such conversion is slow and may be lossy.

</P>

<P>
When you execute <CODE>SET NAMES</CODE> or <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE>, you are also
changing the ``connection collation''. However, the connection
collation exists for consistency only. Usually its value doesn't
matter.

</P>

<P>
With the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, it is not necessary to
execute <CODE>SET NAMES</CODE> every time you start up. You can add the
<CODE>--default-character-set-name</CODE>  option
setting to your <CODE>mysql</CODE> statement line, or in your option file.
For example, the following option file setting will change the connection
character set each time you run <CODE>mysql</CODE>:

</P>

</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="Charset-literal" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-literal">9.3.7  Character String Literal Character Set and Collation</A></H3>

<P>
Every character string literal has a character set and a collation,
which may not be null.

</P>
<P>
A character string literal may have an optional character set
introducer and <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> clause:

</P>

<PRE>
[_character_set_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
</PRE>

<P>
Examples:

<PRE>
SELECT 'string';
SELECT _latin1'string';
SELECT _latin1'string' COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
</PRE>

<P>
The simple statement <CODE>SELECT 'string'</CODE> uses the
connection/literal character set.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>_character_set_name</CODE> expression is formally called
an <EM>introducer</EM>. It tells the parser,
``the string that is about to follow is in character set <CODE>X</CODE>.''
Because this has confused people in the past, we emphasize
that an introducer does not cause any conversion, it is strictly a
signal that does not change the string's value. An introducer is
also legal before standard hex literal and numeric hex literal notation
(<CODE>x'literal'</CODE> and <CODE>0xnnnn</CODE>), and before <CODE>?</CODE> (parameter
substitution when using prepared statements within a programming language
interface).

</P>
<P>
Examples:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT _latin1 x'AABBCC';
SELECT _latin1 0xAABBCC;
SELECT _latin1 ?;
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL determines a literal's character set and collation thus:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>If both <CODE>_X</CODE> and <CODE>COLLATE Y</CODE> were specified then the literal

character set is <CODE>X</CODE> and the literal collation is <CODE>Y</CODE>
<LI>If <CODE>_X</CODE> is specified but <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> is not specified, then the

literal character set is <CODE>X</CODE> and the literal collation is <CODE>X</CODE>'s default
collation
<LI>Otherwise, the connection/literals character set and collation.

</UL>

<P>
Examples:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<H3><A NAME="Charset-collate-precedence" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-collate-precedence">9.3.9  <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> Clause Precedence</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> clause has high precedence (higher than ||), so the expression

</P>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to:

<PRE>
x || (y COLLATE z)
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="Charset-binary-op" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-binary-op">9.3.10  <CODE>BINARY</CODE> Operator</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> operator is a shorthand for a <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> clause. For
example, <CODE>BINARY 'x'</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>'x' COLLATE y</CODE>, where
<CODE>y</CODE> is the
name of an appropriate binary collation. For example, assuming that
column <CODE>a</CODE> is of character set <CODE>latin1</CODE>, these two queries have the
same effect:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY BINARY a;
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a COLLATE latin1_bin;
</PRE>

<P>
Note: Every character set has a binary collation.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-collate-tricky" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-collate-tricky">9.3.11  Some Special Cases Where the Collation Determination is Tricky</A></H3>

<P>
In the great majority of queries, it is obvious what collation
MySQL uses to resolve a comparison operation. For example, in the
following cases it should be clear that the collation will be ``the
column collation of column <CODE>x</CODE>'':

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT x FROM T ORDER BY x;
SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = x;
SELECT DISTINCT x FROM T;
</PRE>

<P>
However, when multiple operands are involved, there can be
ambiguity. For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = 'Y';
</PRE>

<P>
Should this query use the collation of the column <CODE>x</CODE>, or of the
string literal <CODE>'Y'</CODE>?

</P>
<P>
Standard SQL resolves such questions using what used to be
called ``coercibility'' rules. The essence is: Because <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>'Y'</CODE>
both have collations, whose collation takes precedence? It's complex,
but these rules would take care of most situations:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>An explicit <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> clause has precedence 4.

<LI>A concatenation of two strings with different collations has

precedence 3.

<LI>A column's collation has precedence 2.

<LI>A literal's collation has precedence 1.

</UL>

<P>
Those rules resolve ambiguities thus:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Use the collation with the highest precedence.

<LI>If both sides have the same precedence, then it's an error if

the collations aren't the same.

</UL>

<P>
Examples:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<TR><TD><CODE>column1 = 'A'</CODE> </TD><TD> Use collation of <CODE>column1</CODE>

Recall that each character set has one or more
collations, and each collation is associated with one and only one

<P>
And suppose that the column values are retrieved using the following
statement:

</P>

</TABLE>

<P>
The table is an example that shows what the effect would
be if we used different collations in an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause. The
character that's causing the trouble in this example is the U with
two dots over it, which the Germans call U-umlaut, but we'll call
it U-diaeresis.

</P>
<P>
The first column shows the result of the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> using the
Swedish/Finnish collating rule, which says that U-diaeresis sorts
with Y.

</P>
<P>
The second column shows the result of the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> using the
German DIN-1 rule, which says that U-diaeresis sorts with U.

</P>
<P>
The third column shows the result of the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> using the German
DIN-2 rule, which says that U-diaeresis sorts with UE.

</P>

<P>
Three different collations, three different results. That's what
MySQL is here to handle. By using the appropriate collation, you can choose
the sort order you want.

<H2><A NAME="Charset-operations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-operations">9.4  Operations Affected by Character Set Support</A></H2>

<P>
This section describes operations that take character set information
into account now.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-result" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-result">9.4.1  Result Strings</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL has many operators and functions that return a string.
This section answers the question: What is the character set
and collation of such a string?

</P>
<P>
For simple functions that take a string input and return a
string result as output, the output's character set and collation are the
same as the principal input's. For example, <CODE>UPPER(X)</CODE> returns a
string whose character string and collation are the same as that of <CODE>X</CODE>.
The same applies for:
<CODE>INSTR()</CODE>,
<CODE>LCASE()</CODE>,
<CODE>LOWER()</CODE>,
<CODE>LTRIM()</CODE>,
<CODE>MID()</CODE>,
<CODE>REPEAT()</CODE>,
<CODE>REPLACE()</CODE>,
<CODE>REVERSE()</CODE>,
<CODE>RIGHT()</CODE>,
<CODE>RPAD()</CODE>,
<CODE>RTRIM()</CODE>,
<CODE>SOUNDEX()</CODE>,
<CODE>SUBSTRING()</CODE>,
<CODE>TRIM()</CODE>,
<CODE>UCASE()</CODE>,
<CODE>UPPER()</CODE>.
(Also note: the <CODE>REPLACE()</CODE> function, unlike all other functions,
ignores the collation of the string input and performs a
case-insensitive comparison every time.)

</P>
<P>
For operations that combine multiple string inputs and return a
single string output, SQL-99's ``aggregation rules'' apply.
They are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>If explicit <CODE>COLLATE X</CODE> occurs, then use <CODE>X</CODE>

<LI>If explicit <CODE>COLLATE X</CODE> and <CODE>COLLATE Y</CODE> occur, then error

<LI>Otherwise, if all collations are <CODE>X</CODE>, then use <CODE>X</CODE>

<LI>Otherwise, the result has no collation

</UL>

<P>
For example, with <CODE>CASE ... WHEN a THEN b WHEN b THEN c COLLATE X
END</CODE>, the resultant collation is <CODE>X</CODE>. The same applies for:
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>,
<CODE>GREATEST()</CODE>,
<CODE>IF()</CODE>,
<CODE>LEAST()</CODE>,
<CODE>CASE</CODE>,
<CODE>UNION</CODE>,
<CODE>||</CODE>,
<CODE>ELT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For operations that convert to character data, the result
string's character set and collation are in the <I>connection/literals
character set</I> and have the <I>connection/literals collation</I>.
This applies for:
<CODE>CHAR()</CODE>,
<CODE>CAST()</CODE>,
<CODE>CONV()</CODE>,
<CODE>FORMAT()</CODE>.
<CODE>HEX()</CODE>,
<CODE>SPACE()</CODE>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-CONVERT" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-CONVERT">9.4.2  <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> provides a way to convert data between different
character sets. The syntax is:

</P>

<PRE>
CONVERT(expr USING transcoding_name)
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL, transcoding names are the same as the
corresponding character set names.

</P>
<P>
Examples:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CONVERT(_latin1'M@"uller' USING utf8);
INSERT INTO utf8table (utf8column)
   SELECT CONVERT(latin1field USING utf8) FROM latin1table;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>CONVERT(... USING ...)</CODE> is implemented according to the SQL-99
specification.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-CAST" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-CAST">9.4.3  <CODE>CAST()</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
You may also use <CODE>CAST()</CODE> to convert a string to a different character
set. The new format is:

</P>

<PRE>
CAST ( character_string AS character_data_type
    CHARACTER SET character_set_name )
</PRE>

<P>
Example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CAST(_latin1'test' AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8);
</PRE>

<P>
You may not use a <CODE>COLLATE</CODE> clause inside a <CODE>CAST()</CODE>, but you may use
it outside, that is, <CODE>CAST(... COLLATE ...)</CODE> is illegal but
<CODE>CAST(...) COLLATE ...</CODE> is legal.

</P>
<P>
Example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CAST(_latin1'test' AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8) COLLATE utf8_bin;
</PRE>

<P>
If you use <CODE>CAST()</CODE> without specifying <CODE>CHARACTER SET</CODE>, then the
resulting character set and collation are the connection/literal
character set and its default collation. If you use <CODE>CAST()</CODE> with
<CODE>CHARACTER SET X</CODE>, then the resulting character set is <CODE>X</CODE> and the
resulting collation is <CODE>X</CODE>'s default collation.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Charset-SHOW-CHARSET" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-SHOW-CHARSET">9.4.4  <CODE>SHOW CHARACTER SET</CODE></A></H3>

<H2><A NAME="Charset-Unicode" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-Unicode">9.5  Unicode Support</A></H2>

<P>
There are two new (as of MySQL version 4.1) character sets for storing 
Unicode data:
<CODE>ucs2</CODE> (the
UCS-2 Unicode character set) and <CODE>utf8</CODE> (the
UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set).

</P>

<UL>
<LI>In UCS-2 (binary Unicode representation) every character is

represented by a two-byte Unicode code with the most significant
byte first. For example: "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" has the code
0x0041 and it's stored as a two byte sequence: 0x00 0x41. "CYRILLIC
SMALL LETTER YERU" (Unicode 0x044B) is stored as a two byte
sequence: 0x04 0x4B. For Unicode characters and their codes please
refer to the <a HREF="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode Home Page</a>.

Temporary restriction: UCS-2 can't (yet) be used as a client
character set. That means that <CODE>SET NAMES ucs2</CODE> will not work.

<LI>The UTF8 character set (transform Unicode representation) is an

alternative way to store Unicode data. It is implemented according
to RFC2279. The idea of the UTF8 character set is that various
Unicode characters fit into byte sequences of different
lengths.


<UL>
<LI>Basic Latin letters, digits, and punctuation signs use one

byte.
<LI>Most European and Middle East script letters fit into a two-byte

sequence: extended Latin letters (with tilde, macron, acute,
grave and other accents), Cyrillic, Greek, Armenian, Hebrew,
Arabic, Syriac, and others.
<LI>Korean, Chinese and Japanese ideographs use three-byte

sequences.
<LI>Currently, MySQL UTF8 support does not include four-byte sequences.

</UL>

Tip: To save space with UTF8, use <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> instead of <CODE>CHAR</CODE>.
Otherwise, MySQL has to reserve 30 bytes for a <CODE>CHAR(10) CHARACTER
SET utf8</CODE> column, because that's the maximum possible length.

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="Charset-metadata" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-metadata">9.6  UTF8 for Metadata</A></H2>

<P>
The metadata is the data about the data. Anything that
describes the database, as opposed to being the contents of the
database, is metadata. Thus column names, database names, user
names, version names, and most of the string results from <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, are
metadata.

</P>

<P>
All metadata must be in the same character set. (Otherwise, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>
wouldn't work properly because different rows in the same column
would be in different character sets.) On the other hand, metadata
must include all characters in all languages. (Otherwise, users
wouldn't be able to name columns and tables in their own
languages.) In order to allow for both of these objectives, MySQL
stores metadata in a Unicode character set, namely UTF8. This will
not cause any disruption if you never use accented characters. But
if you do, you should be aware that metadata is in UTF8.

</P>

<P>
This means that <CODE>USER()</CODE> (and its synonyms,
<CODE>SESSION_USER()</CODE> and <CODE>SYSTEM_USER()</CODE>), <CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE>,
and <CODE>VERSION()</CODE>
functions will have the UTF8 character set by default.

</P>

<P>
This does NOT mean that the headers of columns and the results
of <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> functions will be in the UTF8 character set by default.
(When you say <CODE>SELECT column1 FROM t</CODE> the name <CODE>column1</CODE> itself will
be returned from the server to the client in the client's character
set as determined by the <CODE>SET NAMES</CODE> statement.)

</P>

<P>
If you want the server to pass metadata results back in a
non-UTF8 character set, then use <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> to force the
server to convert (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Charset-connection">9.3.6  Connection Character Sets and Collations</A>),
or set the client to do the conversion. It is
always more efficient to set the client to do the conversion, but
this option will not be available for many clients until late in
the MySQL 4.x product cycle.

</P>

<P>
If you are just using, for example, the <CODE>USER()</CODE> function for
comparison or assignment within a single statement ... don't worry.
MySQL will do some automatic conversion for you.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM Table1 WHERE USER() = latin1_column;
</PRE>

<P>
This will work, because the contents of <CODE>latin1_column</CODE> are
automatically converted to UTF8 before the comparison.

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO Table1 (latin1_column) SELECT USER();
</PRE>

<P>
This will work, becaues the contents of <CODE>USER()</CODE> are automatically
converted to <CODE>latin1</CODE> before the assignment.
Automatic conversion is not fully implemented yet, but should work
correctly in a later version.

</P>

<P>
Although automatic conversion is not in the SQL standard, the
SQL standard document does say that every character set is (in
terms of supported characters) a ``subset'' of Unicode. Since it is a
well-known principle that ``what applies to a superset can apply to
a subset,'' we believe that a collation for Unicode can apply for
comparisons with non-Unicode strings.

</P>

<P>
VERSION 4.1.1 NOTE: The <TT>`errmsg.txt'</TT> files will all be in UTF8
after this point. Conversion to the client character set will be
automatic, as for metadata. Also: We may change the default
behaviour for passing back result set metadata in the near
future.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Charset-compatibility" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-compatibility">9.7  Compatibility with Other DBMSs</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="Charset-national" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-national">9.9  National Character Set</A></H2>

<P>
In MySQL-4.x and earlier, <CODE>NCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> were synonymous. ANSI
defines <CODE>NCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>NATIONAL CHAR</CODE> as a way to define that a
<CODE>CHAR</CODE>
column should use some predefined character set. MySQL uses <CODE>utf8</CODE> as
that predefined character set. For example, these column type declarations
are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL CHARACTER(10)
NCHAR(10)
</PRE>

<P>
As are these:

</P>

<PRE>

<P>
These two statements are equivalent:

</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="Charset-upgrading" HREF="manual_toc.html#Charset-upgrading">9.10  Upgrading from MySQL 4.0</A></H2>

<P>
Now, what about upgrading from older versions of MySQL? MySQL 4.1
is almost upward compatible with MySQL 4.0 and earlier for the
simple reason that almost all of the features are new, so there's
nothing in earlier versions to conflict with. However, there are
some differences and a few things to be aware of.

</P>
<P>
Most important: The ``MySQL 4.0 character set'' has the properties
of both ``MySQL 4.1 character sets'' and ``MySQL 4.1 collations.'' You
will have to unlearn this. Henceforth we will not bundle character
set / collation properties in the same conglomerate object.

</P>
<P>
There is a special treatment of national character sets in MySQL
4.1. <CODE>NCHAR</CODE> is not the same as <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, and <CODE>N'...'</CODE> literals
are not the same as <CODE>'...'</CODE> literals.

</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a different file format for storing information
about character sets and collations. Make sure you have reinstalled the
<TT>`/share/mysql/charsets/'</TT> directory containing the new configuration files.

</P>
<P>
If you want to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from a 4.1.x distribution with data
created by MySQL 4.0, you should start the server with the same
character set and collation. In this case you won't need to reindex
your data.

</P>
<P>
There are two ways to do so:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-character-set=... --with-collation=...
shell&#62; ./mysqld --default-character-set=... --default-collation=...
</PRE>

<P>
If you used <CODE>mysql</CODE> with, for example, the MySQL 4.0 <CODE>danish</CODE>
character set, you should now use the <CODE>latin1</CODE> character set and
the <CODE>latin1_danish_ci</CODE> collation:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-character-set=latin1

<P>
Here is an annotated list of character sets and collations that
MySQL supports. Because options and installation settings differ,
some sites will not have all items in the list, and some sites will
have items that are not on the list because defining new character
sets or collations is straightforward.

</P>

<P>
MySQL supports 70+ collations for 30+ character sets.

Of course there are our two Unicode character sets. You can store
texts in about 650 languages using these character sets. We have
not added a large number of collations for these two new sets yet,
but that will be happening soon. Now they have default
case-insensitive accent-insensitive collations, plus the binary
collation.

used by the majority of MySQL customers. It is constantly stated
that this is based on the Swedish/Finnish collation rules, but you
will find Swedes and Finns who disagree with that statement.

The <CODE>latin1_german1_ci</CODE> and <CODE>latin1_german2_ci</CODE>

</P>

<P>
MySQL 4.1 introduces spatial extensions to allow the
generation, storage, and analysis of geographic features.
Currently, these features are available for MyISAM tables only.

</P>
<P>
This chapter covers the following topics:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The basis of these spatial extensions in the OpenGIS geometry model

<LI>

Data formats for representing spatial data

<LI>

How to use spatial data in MySQL

<LI>

Use of indexing for spatial data

</P>
<P>
MySQL implements spatial extensions following the specification of
the <CODE>Open GIS Consortium</CODE> (OGC). This is an international consortium
of more than 250 companies, agencies, and universities participating
in the development of publicly available conceptual solutions that can be
useful with all kinds of applications that manage spatial data.
The OGC maintains a web site at <a HREF="http://www.opengis.org/">http://www.opengis.org/</a>.

</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Open GIS Consortium published the
<CITE>OpenGIS (R) Simple Features Specifications For SQL</CITE>, a document that
proposes several conceptual ways for extending an SQL RDBMS to support spatial
data. This specification is available from the Open GIS web site at
http://www.opengis.org/techno/implementation.htm.
It contains additional information relevant to this chapter.

</P>
<P>
MySQL implements a subset of the <STRONG>SQL with Geometry Types</STRONG>
environment proposed by OGC.
This term refers to an SQL environment that has been extended with a
set of geometry types. A geometry-valued SQL column is implemented as
a column that has a geometry type. The specifications describe a set of SQL
geometry types, as well as functions on those types to create and
analyse geometry values.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1628"></A>

<P>
A <STRONG>geographic feature</STRONG> is anything in the world that has a location.
A feature can be:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

An entity. For example, a mountain, a pond, a city.
<LI>

A space. For example, a postcode area, the tropics.
<LI>

A definable location. For example, a crossroad,
as a particular place where two streets intersect.
</UL>

refer to geographic features.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1630"></A>

<P>
<STRONG>Geometry</STRONG> is another word that denotes a geographic feature.
The original meaning of the word <STRONG>geometry</STRONG> denotes a branch of
mathematics.
Another meaning comes from cartography, referring to the geometric
features that cartographers use to map the world.

</P>
<P>
This chapter uses all of these terms synonymously:
<STRONG>geographic feature</STRONG>, <STRONG>geospatial feature</STRONG>,
<STRONG>feature</STRONG>, or <STRONG>geometry</STRONG>.
The term most commonly used here is <STRONG>geometry</STRONG>.

<CODE>Geometry</CODE> is the root class of the hierarchy.  It is a
non-instantiable class but has a number of properties that are common to
all geometry values created from any of the <CODE>Geometry</CODE> subclasses.
These properties are described in the following list.  (Particular
subclasses have their own specific properties, described later.)

</P>


<H3>10.2.3  Geometry properties</H3>

<P>
A geometry value has the following properties:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Its <STRONG>type</STRONG>.
Each geometry belongs to one of the instantiable classes in the hierarchy.

<LI>

Its <STRONG>SRID</STRONG>, or Spatial Reference Identifier. This value identifies
the geometry's associated Spatial Reference System that describes the
coordinate space in which the geometry object is defined.

<LI>

Its <STRONG>coordinates</STRONG> in its Spatial Reference System,
represented as double-precision (8-byte) numbers. All non-empty geometries
include at least one pair of (X,Y) coordinates. Empty geometries contain
no coordinates.

Coordinates are related to the SRID.
For example, in different coordinate systems, the distance between two objects
may differ even when objects have the same coordinates, because the distance
on the <STRONG>planar</STRONG> coordinate system and the distance on the <STRONG>geocentric</STRONG>
system (coordinates on the Earth's surface) are different things.

<LI>

Its <STRONG>interior</STRONG>, <STRONG>boundary</STRONG>, and <STRONG>exterior</STRONG>.
All geometries occupy some position in space. The exterior of
a geometry is all space not occupied by the geometry. The interior
is the space occupied by the geometry. The boundary is the
interface between geometry's interior and exterior.

<LI>

Its <STRONG>MBR</STRONG> (Minimum Bounding Rectangle), or Envelope.
This is the bounding geometry, formed by the minimum and maximum (X,Y)
coordinates:


<PRE>
((MINX MINY, MAXX MINY, MAXX MAXY, MINX MAXY, MINX MINY))
</PRE>

<LI>

The quality of being <STRONG>simple</STRONG> or <STRONG>non-simple</STRONG>.
Geometry values of some types (<CODE>LineString</CODE>, <CODE>MultiPoint</CODE>,
<CODE>MultiLineString)</CODE>
are either simple of non-simple. Each type determines its own assertions
for being simple or non-simple.

<LI>

The quality of being <STRONG>closed</STRONG> or <STRONG>not closed</STRONG>.
Geometry values of some types (<CODE>LineString</CODE>, <CODE>MultiString</CODE>) are
either closed
or not closed. Each type determines its own assertions for being closed
or not closed.

<LI>

The quality of being <STRONG>empty</STRONG> or <STRONG>not empty</STRONG>
A geometry is empty if it does not have any points.
Exterior, interior and boundary of an empty geometry
are not defined (that is, they are represented by a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value).
An empty geometry is defined to be always simple and has an area of 0.

<LI>

Its <STRONG>dimension</STRONG>. A geometry can have a dimension of -1, 0, 1,
or 2:


<UL>

<LI>-1 stands for empty geometries.

<LI>0 stands for geometries with no length and no area.

<LI>1 stands for geometries with non-zero length and zero area.

<LI>2 stands for geometries with non-zero area.

</UL>

<CODE>Point</CODE> objects have a dimension of zero.  <CODE>LineString</CODE>
objects have a dimension of 1. <CODE>Polygon</CODE> objects have a
dimension of 2.  The dimensions of <CODE>MultiPoint</CODE>,
<CODE>MultiLineString</CODE>, and <CODE>MultiPolygon</CODE> objects are the
same as the dimensions of the elements they consist of.

</P>
<P>
The Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation for geometric values is defined by
the OpenGIS specifications.
It is also defined in the ISO ``SQL/MM Part 3: Spatial'' standard.

</P>
<P>
WKB is used to exchange geometry data as binary streams represented by
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> values containing geometric WKB information.

</P>
<P>
WKB uses 1-byte unsigned integers, 4-byte unsigned integers, and 8-byte
double-precision numbers (IEEE 754 format). A byte is 8 bits.

</P>
<P>
For example, a WKB value that corresponds to <CODE>POINT(1 1)</CODE> consists of
this sequence of 21 bytes (each represented here by two hex digits):

</P>

<PRE>
0101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F03F
</PRE>

<P>
The sequence may be broken down into these components:

</P>

<PRE>
Byte order : 01
WKB type   : 01000000
X          : 000000000000F03F
Y          : 000000000000F03F
</PRE>

<P>
Component representation is as follows:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The byte order may be either 0 or 1 to indicate little-endian or big-endian
storage. The little-endian and big-endian byte orders are also known as
Network Data Representation (NDR) and External Data Representation (XDR),
respectively.

<LI>

The WKB type is a code that indicates the geometry type. Values from 1 through
7 indicate
<CODE>Point</CODE>,
<CODE>LineString</CODE>,
<CODE>Polygon</CODE>,
<CODE>MultiPoint</CODE>,
<CODE>MultiLineString</CODE>,
<CODE>MultiPolygon</CODE>,
and
<CODE>GeometryCollection</CODE>.

<LI>

A <CODE>Point</CODE> value has X and Y coordinates, each represented as a
double-precision value.

WKB values for more complex geometry values are represented by more complex
data structures, as detailed in the OpenGIS specification.

<H3><A NAME="Populating_spatial_columns" HREF="manual_toc.html#Populating_spatial_columns">10.4.4  Populating Spatial Columns</A></H3>

<P>
After you have created spatial columns, you can populate them
with spatial data.

</P>
<P>
Values should be stored in internal geometry format, but you can convert them
to that format from either Well-Known Text (WKT) or Well-Known Binary (WKB)
format. The following examples demonstrate how to insert geometry values into
a table by converting WKT values into internal geometry format.

</P>
<P>
You can perform the conversion directly in the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)'));

SET @g = 'POINT(1 1)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@g));
</PRE>

<P>
Or conversion can take place prior to the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
SET @g = GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)');
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (@g);
</PRE>

<P>
The following examples insert more complex geometries into the table:

</P>

<PRE>
SET @g = 'LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2,3 3,4 4))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@g));
</PRE>

<P>
The preceding examples all use <CODE>GeomFromText()</CODE> to create geometry
values.  You can also use type-specific functions:

</P>

<PRE>
SET @g = 'POINT(1 1)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (PointFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (LineStringFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (PolygonFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2,3 3,4 4))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomCollFromText(@g));
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if a client application program wants to use WKB representations
of geometry values, it is responsible for sending correctly formed WKB in
queries to the server. However, there are several ways of satisfying this
requirement. For example:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Inserting a <CODE>POINT(1 1)</CODE> value with hex literal syntax:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO geom VALUES
    -&#62; (GeomFromWKB(0x0101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F03F));
</PRE>

<LI>An ODBC application can send a WKB representation, binding it to a

placeholder using an argument of <CODE>BLOB</CODE> type:

<PRE>
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromWKB(?))
</PRE>

Other programming interfaces may support a similar placeholder mechanism.

<LI>In a C program, you can escape a binary value using

<CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> and include the result in a query string
that is sent to the server.

<P>
After populating spatial columns with values, you are ready to
query and analyse them.  MySQL provides a set of functions to
perform various operations on spatial data. These functions can be
grouped into four major categories according to the type of operation
they perform:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Functions that convert geometries between various formats

<LI>

Functions that provide access to qualitative or quantitative properties of a geometry

<LI>

Functions that describe relations between two geometries

<LI>

Functions that create new geometries from existing ones

</UL>

<P>
Spatial analysis functions can be used in many contexts, such as:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Any interactive SQL program, like <CODE>mysql</CODE> or <CODE>MySQLCC</CODE>

<LI>

Application programs written in any language that supports a MySQL client API

</UL>

MySQL supports the following functions for converting geometry values between
internal format and either WKT or WKB format:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>GeomFromText(wkt[,srid])</CODE>

A number of type-specific functions are also supported, such as
<CODE>PointFromText()</CODE> and <CODE>LineFromText()</CODE>; see
section <A HREF="manual.html#GIS_WKT_Functions">10.4.2.1  Creating Geometry Values Using WKT Functions</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1685"></A>
<DT><CODE>GeomFromWKB(wkb[,srid])</CODE>
<DD>
Converts a binary value from its WKB representation into internal geometry
format and returns the result.
A number of type-specific functions are also supported, such as
<CODE>PointFromWKB()</CODE> and <CODE>LineFromWKB()</CODE>; see
section <A HREF="manual.html#GIS_WKB_Functions">10.4.2.2  Creating Geometry Values Using WKB Functions</A>.

<P>
Each function that belongs to this group takes a geometry value as its
argument and returns some quantitive or qualitive property of the
geometry. Some functions restrict their argument type. Such functions
return <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the argument is of an incorrect geometry
type.  For example, <CODE>Area()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the object
type is neither <CODE>Polygon</CODE> nor <CODE>MultiPolygon</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Contains(g1,g2)</CODE>

Otherwise, returns 0.

The term <STRONG>spatially crosses</STRONG> denotes a spatial relation between two given
geometries that has the following properties:


<UL>

<LI>

The two geometries intersect

<LI>

Their intersection results in a geometry that has
a dimension that is one less than the maximum dimension of the two given
geometries

<H2><A NAME="Optimising_spatial_analysis" HREF="manual_toc.html#Optimising_spatial_analysis">10.6  Optimising Spatial Analysis</A></H2>

<P>
It is known that search operations in non-spatial databases can be optimised
using indexes. This is true for spatial databases as well.
With the help of a great variety of multi-dimensional indexing methods that
have already been designed, it's possible to optimise
spatial searches. The most typical of these are:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Point queries that search for all objects that contain a given point

<LI>Region queries that search for all objects that overlap a given region

</UL>

<P>
MySQL utilises <STRONG>R-Trees with quadratic splitting</STRONG> to index
spatial columns. A spatial index is built using the MBR of a geometry.
For most geometries, the MBR is a minimum rectangle that
surrounds the geometries. For a horizontal or a vertical
linestring, the MBR is a rectangle degenerated into the linestring.
For a point, the MBR is a rectangle degenerated into the point.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Creating_spatial_indexes" HREF="manual_toc.html#Creating_spatial_indexes">10.6.1  Creating Spatial Indexes</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL can create spatial indexes using syntax similar to that for creating
regular indexes, but extended with the <CODE>SPATIAL</CODE> keyword.
Spatial columns that are indexed currently must be declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
The following examples demonstrate how to create spatial indexes.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>With <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL, SPATIAL INDEX(g));
</PRE>

<LI>With <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g);
</PRE>

<LI>With <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE SPATIAL INDEX sp_index ON geom (g);
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
To drop spatial indexes, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>With <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE geom DROP INDEX g;
</PRE>

<LI>With <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; DROP INDEX sp_index ON geom;
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Example: Suppose that a table <CODE>geom</CODE> contains more than 32000 geometries,
which are stored in the column <CODE>g</CODE> of type <CODE>GEOMETRY</CODE>.
The table also has an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column <CODE>fid</CODE> for storing
object ID values.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW FIELDS FROM geom;
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| fid   | int(11)  |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| g     | geometry |      |     |         |                |
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM geom;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    32376 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
To add a spatial index on the column <CODE>g</CODE>, use this statement:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g);
Query OK, 32376 rows affected (4.05 sec)
Records: 32376  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

<H3><A NAME="Using_a_spatial_index" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_a_spatial_index">10.6.2  Using a Spatial Index</A></H3>

<P>
The optimiser investigates whether available spatial indexes can
be involved in the search for queries that use a function such as
<CODE>MBRContains()</CODE> or <CODE>MBRWithin()</CODE> in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
For example, let's say we want to find all objects that are in the
given rectangle:

<DT>Additional Metadata Views
<DD>
OpenGIS specifications propose several additional metadata views.
For example, a system view named <CODE>GEOMETRY_COLUMNS</CODE> contains a
description of geometry columns, one row for each geometry column
in the database.

<DT>Functions to add/drop spatial columns
<DD>
OpenGIS assumes that columns can be added or dropped using special
<CODE>AddGeometryColumn()</CODE> and <CODE>DropGeometryColumn()</CODE>
functions. In MySQL, this is done using the <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>, and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> statements instead.

<DT>Factors related to Spatial Reference Systems and their IDs (SRIDs):
<DD>

<UL>

<LI>

Functions like <CODE>Length()</CODE> and <CODE>Area()</CODE> assume a planar
coordinate system.

<LI>

All objects currently are considered to be in the same planar
coordinate system.

</UL>

<DT>The OpenGIS function <CODE>Length()</CODE> on <CODE>LineString</CODE> and <CODE>MultiLineString</CODE> currently should be called in MySQL as <CODE>GLength()</CODE>
<DD>
The problem is that it conflicts with the existing SQL function
<CODE>Length()</CODE> that calculates the length of string values,
and sometimes it's not possible to distinguish whether the function is
called in a textual or spatial context. We need either to solve this
somehow, or decide on another function name.

<A NAME="IDX1743"></A>

</P>

<P>
This chapter describes the APIs available for MySQL, where to get
them, and how to use them.  The C API is the most extensively covered, as it
was developed by the MySQL team, and is the basis for most of the
other APIs.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="C" HREF="manual_toc.html#C">11.1  MySQL C API</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1747"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1748"></A>

</P>

<P>
The C API code is distributed with MySQL. It is included in the
<CODE>mysqlclient</CODE> library and allows C programs to access a database.

</P>
<P>
Many of the clients in the MySQL source distribution are
written in C.  If you are looking for examples that demonstrate how to
use the C API, take a look at these clients. You can find these in the
<CODE>clients</CODE> directory in the MySQL source distribution.

</P>
<P>
Most of the other client APIs (all except Connector/J) use the <CODE>mysqlclient</CODE>
library to communicate with the MySQL server. This means that, for
example, you can take advantage of many of the same environment variables
that are used by other client programs, because they are referenced from the
library.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Client-Side_Scripts">4.8  MySQL Client-Side Scripts and Utilities</A>, for a list of these variables.

</P>
<P>
The client has a maximum communication buffer size. The size of the buffer
that is allocated initially (16K bytes) is automatically increased up to the
maximum size (the maximum is 16M). Because buffer sizes are increased
only as demand warrants, simply increasing the default maximum limit does not
in itself cause more resources to be used. This size check is mostly a check
for erroneous queries and communication packets.

</P>
<P>
The communication buffer must be large enough to contain a single SQL
statement (for client-to-server traffic) and one row of returned data (for
server-to-client traffic).  Each thread's communication buffer is dynamically
enlarged to handle any query or row up to the maximum limit.  For example, if
you have <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values that contain up to 16M of data, you must have a
communication buffer limit of at least 16M (in both server and client).  The
client's default maximum is 16M, but the default maximum in the server is
1M.  You can increase this by changing the value of the
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> parameter when the server is started.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server shrinks each communication buffer to
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> bytes after each query.  For clients, the size of
the buffer associated with a connection is not decreased until the connection
is closed, at which time client memory is reclaimed.

</P>
<P>
For programming with threads, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">11.1.14  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.
For creating a stand-alone application which includes the
"server" and "client" in the same program (and does not
communicate with an external MySQL server), see section <A HREF="manual.html#libmysqld">11.1.15  libmysqld, the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A>.

<DT><CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1749"></A>
 
This structure represents a handle to one database connection. It is
used for almost all MySQL functions.

<A NAME="IDX1750"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_RES</CODE>
<DD>
This structure represents the result of a query that returns rows
(<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).  The
information returned from a query is called the <EM>result set</EM> in the
remainder of this section.

<A NAME="IDX1751"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_ROW</CODE>
<DD>
This is a type-safe representation of one row of data. It is currently
implemented as an array of counted byte strings.  (You cannot treat these as
null-terminated strings if field values may contain binary data, because such
values may contain null bytes internally.)  Rows are obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1752"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE>
<DD>
This structure contains information about a field, such as the field's
name, type, and size. Its members are described in more detail here.
You may obtain the <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structures for each field by
calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> repeatedly.  Field values are not part of
this structure; they are contained in a <CODE>MYSQL_ROW</CODE> structure.

<A NAME="IDX1753"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_FIELD_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
This is a type-safe representation of an offset into a MySQL field
list.  (Used by <CODE>mysql_field_seek()</CODE>.)  Offsets are field numbers
within a row, beginning at zero.

<A NAME="IDX1754"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1755"></A>
<DT><CODE>my_ulonglong</CODE>
<DD>
The type used for the number of rows and for <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>, and <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>. This type provides a
range of <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>1.84e19</CODE>.

On some systems, attempting to print a value of type <CODE>my_ulonglong</CODE>
will not work.  To print such a value, convert it to <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>
and use a <CODE>%lu</CODE> print format.  Example:

<PRE>
printf ("Number of rows: %lu\n", (unsigned long) mysql_num_rows(result));
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structure contains the members listed here:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>char * name</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the field, as a null-terminated string.

<DT><CODE>char * table</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the table containing this field, if it isn't a calculated field.
For calculated fields, the <CODE>table</CODE> value is an empty string.

<DT><CODE>char * def</CODE>
<DD>
The default value of this field, as a null-terminated string.  This is set
only if you use <CODE>mysql_list_fields()</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>enum enum_field_types type</CODE>
<DD>
The type of the field.
The <CODE>type</CODE> value may be one of the following:

<TR><TD><CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> </TD><TD> Deprecated; use <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY</CODE> instead
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

You can use the <CODE>IS_NUM()</CODE> macro to test whether a field has a
numeric type.  Pass the <CODE>type</CODE> value to <CODE>IS_NUM()</CODE> and it
will evaluate to TRUE if the field is numeric:


<PRE>
if (IS_NUM(field-&#62;type))
    printf("Field is numeric\n");
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int length</CODE>
<DD>
The width of the field, as specified in the table definition.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int max_length</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum width of the field for the result set (the length of the longest
field value for the rows actually in the result set). If you use
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_list_fields()</CODE>, this contains the
maximum length for the field.  If you use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, the
value of this variable is zero.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int flags</CODE>
<DD>
Different bit-flags for the field.  The <CODE>flags</CODE> value may have zero
or more of the following bits set:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Flag value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Flag description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>NOT_NULL_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field can't be <CODE>NULL</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PRI_KEY_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is part of a primary key
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>UNIQUE_KEY_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is part of a unique key
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MULTIPLE_KEY_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is part of a non-unique key
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>UNSIGNED_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field has the <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> attribute
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>ZEROFILL_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field has the <CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE> attribute
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>BINARY_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field has the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field has the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
attribute
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>ENUM_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> (deprecated)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is a <CODE>SET</CODE> (deprecated)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>BLOB_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> (deprecated)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> (deprecated)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Use of the <CODE>BLOB_FLAG</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM_FLAG</CODE>, <CODE>SET_FLAG</CODE>, and
<CODE>TIMESTAMP_FLAG</CODE> flags is deprecated because they indicate the type of
a field rather than an attribute of its type.  It is preferable to test
<CODE>field-&#62;type</CODE> against <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_ENUM</CODE>,
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_SET</CODE>, or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP</CODE> instead.

The following example illustrates a typical use of the <CODE>flags</CODE> value:


<PRE>
if (field-&#62;flags &#38; NOT_NULL_FLAG)
    printf("Field can't be null\n");
</PRE>

You may use the following convenience macros to determine the boolean
status of the <CODE>flags</CODE> value:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Flag status</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>IS_NOT_NULL(flags)</CODE> </TD><TD> True if this field is defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>IS_PRI_KEY(flags)</CODE> </TD><TD> True if this field is a primary key
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>IS_BLOB(flags)</CODE> </TD><TD> True if this field is a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> (deprecated; test <CODE>field-&#62;type</CODE> instead)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int decimals</CODE>
<DD>
The number of decimals for numeric fields.

<P>
To connect to the server, call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to initialise a
connection handler, then call <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> with that
handler (along with other information such as the hostname, user name,
and password).  Upon connection, <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> sets the
<CODE>reconnect</CODE> flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of
<CODE>1</CODE>. This flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be
performed because of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the
server before giving up.  When you are done with the connection, call
<CODE>mysql_close()</CODE> to terminate it.

</P>
<P>
While a connection is active, the client may send SQL queries to the server
using <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>.  The difference
between the two is that <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> expects the query to be
specified as a null-terminated string whereas <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>
expects a counted string.  If the string contains binary data (which may
include null bytes), you must use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For each non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> query (for example, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>), you can find out how many rows were changed (affected)
by calling <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries, you retrieve the selected rows as a result set.
(Note that some statements are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like in that they return rows.
These include <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.  They should
be treated the same way as <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.)

</P>
<P>
There are two ways for a client to process result sets.  One way is to
retrieve the entire result set all at once by calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.  This function acquires from the server all the
rows returned by the query and stores them in the client.  The second way is
for the client to initiate a row-by-row result set retrieval by calling
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>.  This function initialises the retrieval, but does
not actually get any rows from the server.

</P>
<P>
In both cases, you access rows by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.  With
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> accesses rows that have
already been fetched from the server.  With <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> actually retrieves the row from the server.
Information about the size of the data in each row is available by
calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After you are done with a result set, call <CODE>mysql_free_result()</CODE>
to free the memory used for it.

</P>
<P>
The two retrieval mechanisms are complementary.  Client programs should
choose the approach that is most appropriate for their requirements.
In practice, clients tend to use <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> more
commonly.

</P>
<P>
An advantage of <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> is that because the rows have all
been fetched to the client, you not only can access rows sequentially, you
can move back and forth in the result set using <CODE>mysql_data_seek()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_row_seek()</CODE> to change the current row position within the result
set.  You can also find out how many rows there are by calling
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>.  On the other hand, the memory requirements for
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> may be very high for large result sets and you
are more likely to encounter out-of-memory conditions.

</P>
<P>
An advantage of <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> is that the client requires less
memory for the result set because it maintains only one row at a time (and
because there is less allocation overhead, <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> can be
faster).  Disadvantages are that you must process each row quickly to avoid
tying up the server, you don't have random access to rows within the result
set (you can only access rows sequentially), and you don't know how many rows
are in the result set until you have retrieved them all.  Furthermore, you
<STRONG>must</STRONG> retrieve all the rows even if you determine in mid-retrieval that
you've found the information you were looking for.

</P>
<P>
The API makes it possible for clients to respond appropriately to
queries (retrieving rows only as necessary) without knowing whether or
not the query is a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  You can do this by calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> after each <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> (or
<CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>).  If the result set call succeeds, the query
was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and you can read the rows.  If the result set call
fails, call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to determine whether a
result was actually to be expected.  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>
returns zero, the query returned no data (indicating that it was an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, etc.), and was not
expected to return rows.  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> is non-zero, the
query should have returned rows, but didn't.  This indicates that the
query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that failed.  See the description for
<CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> for an example of how this can be done.

</P>
<P>
Both <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> allow you to
obtain information about the fields that make up the result set (the number
of fields, their names and types, etc.).  You can access field information
sequentially within the row by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> repeatedly,
or by field number within the row by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_field_direct()</CODE>.  The current field cursor position may be
changed by calling <CODE>mysql_field_seek()</CODE>.  Setting the field cursor
affects subsequent calls to <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE>.  You can also get
information for fields all at once by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_fields()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For detecting and reporting errors, MySQL provides access to error
information by means of the <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
functions.  These return the error code or error message for the most
recently invoked function that can succeed or fail, allowing you to determine
when an error occurred and what it was.

<H3><A NAME="C_API_functions" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_API_functions">11.1.3  C API Function Descriptions</A></H3>

<P>
In the descriptions here, a parameter or return value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> means
<CODE>NULL</CODE> in the sense of the C programming language, not a
MySQL <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
Functions that return a value generally return a pointer or an integer.
Unless specified otherwise, functions returning a pointer return a
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value to indicate success or a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value to indicate
an error, and functions returning an integer return zero to indicate success
or non-zero to indicate an error.  Note that ``non-zero'' means just that.
Unless the function description says otherwise, do not test against a value
other than zero:

</P>

<PRE>
if (result)                   /* correct */
    ... error ...

if (result &#60; 0)               /* incorrect */
    ... error ...

if (result == -1)             /* incorrect */
    ... error ...
</PRE>

<P>
When a function returns an error, the <STRONG>Errors</STRONG> subsection of the
function description lists the possible types of errors.  You can
find out which of these occurred by calling <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>.
A string representation of the error may be obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>.

<P>
<CODE>my_ulonglong mysql_affected_rows(MYSQL *mysql)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.2  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of rows changed by the last <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, deleted by
the last <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or inserted by the last <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statement. May be called immediately after <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> for
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  For
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> works like
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.3  Return Values</H4>

<P>
An integer greater than zero indicates the number of rows affected or
retrieved.  Zero indicates that no records where updated for an
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement, no rows matched the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the
query or that no query has yet been executed.  -1 indicates that the
query returned an error or that, for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> was called prior to calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.4  Errors</H4>

</PRE>

<P>
If one specifies the flag <CODE>CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> when connecting to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> will return the number of
rows matched by the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement for <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

</P>
<P>
Note that when one uses a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> will return 2 if the new row replaced and
old row.  This is because in this case one row was inserted after the
duplicate was deleted.

<P>
This function was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.3.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE> fails unless the connected user can be

this case the user and database are not changed

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>db</CODE> parameter may be set to <CODE>NULL</CODE> if you don't want to have a
default database.

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.6 this command will always <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> any
active transactions, close all temporary tables, unlock all locked
tables and reset the state as if one had done a new connect.
This will happen even if the user didn't change.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.8  Return Values</H4>

<P>
Zero for success.  Non-zero if an error occurred.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.9  Errors</H4>

<P>
This function is deprecated.  It is preferable to use
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL

</P>
<P>
The meanings of the parameters are the same as for the corresponding
parameters for <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> with the difference that the
connection parameter may be <CODE>NULL</CODE>. In this case the C API
allocates memory for the connection structure automatically and frees it
when you call <CODE>mysql_close()</CODE>. The disadvantage of this approach is
that you can't retrieve an error message if the connection fails.  (To
get error information from <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>,
you must provide a valid <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> pointer.)

<H4>11.1.3.47  Description</H4>

<P>
This function is deprecated.  <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
may be used instead.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> determines whether the last row of a result
set has been read.

</P>
<P>
If you acquire a result set from a successful call to
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, the client receives the entire set in one
operation.  In this case, a <CODE>NULL</CODE> return from
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> always means the end of the result set has been
reached and it is unnecessary to call <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>.  When used
with <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> will always return
true.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> to initiate a result
set retrieval, the rows of the set are obtained from the server one by one as
you call <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> repeatedly.  Because an error may occur on
the connection during this process, a <CODE>NULL</CODE> return value from
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> does not necessarily mean the end of the result set
was reached normally.  In this case, you can use <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> to
determine what happened.  <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> returns a non-zero value if the
end of the result set was reached and zero if an error occurred.

</P>
<P>
Historically, <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> predates the standard MySQL error
functions <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>.  Because those error
functions provide the same information, their use is preferred over
<CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>, which is now deprecated.  (In fact, they provide more
information, because <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> returns only a boolean value whereas
the error functions indicate a reason for the error when one occurs.)

<H4>11.1.3.48  Return Values</H4>

<P>
Zero if no error occurred. Non-zero if the end of the result set has been

The following example shows how you might use <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql_query(&#38;mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&#38;mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
{
    // do something with data

{
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&#38;mysql));
}
</PRE>

<P>
However, you can achieve the same effect with the standard MySQL
error functions:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql_query(&#38;mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&#38;mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.52  Description</H4>

<P>
For the connection specified by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> returns
the error code for the most recently invoked API function that can succeed
or fail.  A return value of zero means that no error occurred. Client error
message numbers are listed in the MySQL <TT>`errmsg.h'</TT> header file.
Server error message numbers are listed in <TT>`mysqld_error.h'</TT>. In the
MySQL source distribution you can find a complete list of
error messages and error numbers in the file <TT>`Docs/mysqld_error.txt'</TT>.
The server error codes also are listed at section <A HREF="manual.html#Error-returns">12.1  Error Returns</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that some functions like <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> don't set
<CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> if they succeed.

</P>
<P>
A rule of thumb is that all functions that have to ask the server for
information will reset <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> if they succeed.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.53  Return Values</H4>

<H4>11.1.3.56  Description</H4>

<P>
For the connection specified by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
returns a null-terminated string containing the error message for the
most recently invoked API function that failed. If a function didn't
fail, the return value of <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> may be the previous error
or an empty string to indicate no error.

</P>
<P>
A rule of thumb is that all functions that have to ask the server for
information will reset <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> if they succeed.

</P>
<P>
For functions that resets <CODE>mysql_errno</CODE>, the following two tests
are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>

}

if(mysql_error(&#38;mysql)[0] != '\0')

<P>
The language of the client error messages may be changed by

<P>
<CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> is reset to return information about the first

</P>
<P>
If you've called <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> to perform a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> on a table
but have not called <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, MySQL returns the
default blob length (8K bytes) if you call <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> to ask
for the length of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> field.  (The 8K size is chosen because
MySQL doesn't know the maximum length for the <CODE>BLOB</CODE>. This
should be made configurable sometime.) Once you've retrieved the result set,
<CODE>field-&#62;max_length</CODE> contains the length of the largest value for this
column in the specific query.

<H4>11.1.3.76  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the lengths of the columns of the current row within a result set.
If you plan to copy field values, this length information is also useful for
optimisation, because you can avoid calling <CODE>strlen()</CODE>.  In addition, if
the result set contains binary data, you <STRONG>must</STRONG> use this function to
determine the size of the data, because <CODE>strlen()</CODE> returns incorrect
results for any field containing null characters.

The length for empty columns and for columns containing <CODE>NULL</CODE> values is
zero.  To see how to distinguish these two cases, see the description for

<H4>11.1.3.81  Description</H4>

<P>
Retrieves the next row of a result set. When used after
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>
when there are no more rows to retrieve.  When used after
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> when
there are no more rows to retrieve or if an error occurred.

</P>
<P>
The number of values in the row is given by <CODE>mysql_num_fields(result)</CODE>.
If <CODE>row</CODE> holds the return value from a call to <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>,
pointers to the values are accessed as <CODE>row[0]</CODE> to

indicated by <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointers.

</P>
<P>
The lengths of the field values in the row may be obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE>.  Empty fields and fields containing
<CODE>NULL</CODE> both have length 0; you can distinguish these by checking
the pointer for the field value.  If the pointer is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the field
is <CODE>NULL</CODE>; otherwise, the field is empty.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.86  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of columns for the most recent query on the connection.

</P>
<P>
The normal use of this function is when <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
returned <CODE>NULL</CODE> (and thus you have no result set pointer).
In this case, you can call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to
determine whether <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> should have produced a
non-empty result.  This allows the client program to take proper action
without knowing whether the query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (or
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like) statement.  The example shown here illustrates how this
may be done.

<H4>11.1.3.131  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the ID generated for an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column by the previous
query.  Use this function after you have performed an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> query
into a table that contains an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> field.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> if the previous query
does not generate an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value.  If you need to save
the value for later, be sure to call <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> immediately
after the query that generates the value.

</P>
<P>
If the previous query returned an error, the value of <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>
is undefined.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> is updated after <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that generate an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value or
that set a column value to <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
Also note that the value of the SQL <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function always
contains the most recently generated <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value, and is
not reset between queries because the value of that function is maintained
in the server.

<P>
The second form doesn't work on MySQL Version 3.22.24 or newer.  To pass a

<P>
Returns the number of columns in a result set.

</P>
<P>
Note that you can get the number of columns either from a pointer to a result
set or to a connection handle.  You would use the connection handle if
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> returned
<CODE>NULL</CODE> (and thus you have no result set pointer).  In this case, you can
call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to determine whether
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> should have produced a non-empty result.  This
allows the client program to take proper action without knowing whether or
not the query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (or <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like) statement.  The
example shown here illustrates how this may be done.

<H4>11.1.3.172  Description</H4>
<P>
Executes the SQL query pointed to by the null-terminated string <CODE>query</CODE>.
The query must consist of a single SQL statement.  You should not add
a terminating semicolon (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) or <CODE>\g</CODE> to the statement.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> cannot be used for queries that contain binary data; you
should use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE> instead.  (Binary data may contain the

query string.)

</P>
<P>
If you want to know if the query should return a result set or not, you can
use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to check for this.

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.176  Description</H4>

<P>
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> attempts to establish a connection to a
MySQL database engine running on <CODE>host</CODE>.
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> must complete successfully before you can execute
any of the other API functions, with the exception of
<CODE>mysql_get_client_info()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The parameters are specified as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first parameter should be the address of an existing <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
structure.  Before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> you must call
<CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to initialise the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure. You can
change a lot of connect options with the <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>
call.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_options">11.1.3.163  <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The value of <CODE>host</CODE> may be either a hostname or an IP address.  If
<CODE>host</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE> or the string <CODE>"localhost"</CODE>, a connection to
the local host is assumed. If the OS supports sockets (Unix) or named pipes
(Windows), they are used instead of TCP/IP to connect to the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>user</CODE> parameter contains the user's MySQL login ID.  If
<CODE>user</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE> or the empty string <CODE>""</CODE>, the current
user is assumed.  Under Unix, this is the current login name.  Under
Windows ODBC, the current user name must be specified explicitly.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC_administrator">11.2.2  How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>passwd</CODE> parameter contains the password for <CODE>user</CODE>.  If
<CODE>passwd</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, only entries in the <CODE>user</CODE> table for the
user that have a blank (empty) password field will be checked for a match. This
allows the database administrator to set up the MySQL privilege
system in such a way that users get different privileges depending on whether
or not they have specified a password.

Note: Do not attempt to encrypt the password before calling
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>; password encryption is handled automatically by
the client API.

<LI>

<CODE>db</CODE> is the database name.
If <CODE>db</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the connection will set the default
database to this value.

<LI>

If <CODE>port</CODE> is not 0, the value will be used as the port number
for the TCP/IP connection.  Note that the <CODE>host</CODE> parameter
determines the type of the connection.

<LI>

If <CODE>unix_socket</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the string specifies the
socket or named pipe that should be used.  Note that the <CODE>host</CODE>
parameter determines the type of the connection.

<LI>

The value of <CODE>client_flag</CODE> is usually 0, but can be set to a combination
of the following flags in very special circumstances:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Flag name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Flag description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_COMPRESS</CODE> </TD><TD> Use compression protocol.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES</CODE> </TD><TD> Enable <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> handling.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_MULTI_QUERIES</CODE> </TD><TD> Tell the server that the client may send multi-row-queries (separated with <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>). If this flag is not set, multi-row-queries are disabled. New in 4.1.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_NO_SCHEMA</CODE> </TD><TD> Don't allow the <CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE> syntax.  This is for ODBC. It causes the parser to generate an error if you use that syntax, which is useful for trapping bugs in some ODBC programs.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_ODBC</CODE> </TD><TD> The client is an ODBC client. This changes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be more ODBC-friendly.
</TD></TR>

<H4>11.1.3.179  Example</H4>


<PRE>
MYSQL mysql;

mysql_init(&#38;mysql);
mysql_options(&#38;mysql,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,"your_prog_name");
if (!mysql_real_connect(&#38;mysql,"host","user","passwd","database",0,NULL,0))
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect to database: Error: %s\n",
          mysql_error(&#38;mysql));
}
</PRE>

<P>
By using <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> the MySQL library will read the
<CODE>[client]</CODE> and <CODE>[your_prog_name]</CODE> sections in the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file which will ensure that your program will work, even if someone has
set up MySQL in some non-standard way.

</P>
<P>
Note that upon connection, <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> sets the <CODE>reconnect</CODE>
flag (part of the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure) to a value of <CODE>1</CODE>. This
flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be performed because
of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the server before giving up.

<P>
<CODE>unsigned long mysql_real_escape_string(MYSQL *mysql, char *to, const char *from, unsigned long length)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>11.1.3.181  Description</H4>

<P>
This function is used to create a legal SQL string that you can use in a
SQL statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_syntax">6.1.1.1  Strings</A>.

</P>
<P>
The string in <CODE>from</CODE> is encoded to an escaped SQL string, taking
into account the current character set of the connection. The result is placed
in <CODE>to</CODE> and a terminating null byte is appended.  Characters
encoded are <CODE>NUL</CODE> (ASCII 0), <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`''</SAMP>, <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>, and Control-Z (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Literals">6.1.1  Literals: How to Write Strings and Numbers</A>).
(Strictly speaking, MySQL requires only that backslash and the quote
character used to quote the string in the query be escaped.  This function
quotes the other characters to make them easier to read in log files.)

</P>
<P>
The string pointed to by <CODE>from</CODE> must be <CODE>length</CODE> bytes long.  You
must allocate the <CODE>to</CODE> buffer to be at least <CODE>length*2+1</CODE> bytes
long.  (In the worst case, each character may need to be encoded as using two
bytes, and you need room for the terminating null byte.)  When
<CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> returns, the contents of <CODE>to</CODE> will be a
null-terminated string.  The return value is the length of the encoded
string, not including the terminating null character.

</P>

every query that successfully retrieves data (<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>,
<CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> initiates a result set retrieval but does not
actually read the result set into the client like <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
does.  Instead, each row must be retrieved individually by making calls to
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.  This reads the result of a query directly from the
server without storing it in a temporary table or local buffer, which is
somewhat faster and uses much less memory than <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
The client will only allocate memory for the current row and a communication
buffer that may grow up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you shouldn't use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> if you are
doing a lot of processing for each row on the client side, or if the output
is sent to a screen on which the user may type a <CODE>^S</CODE> (stop scroll).
This will tie up the server and prevent other threads from updating any
tables from which the data is being fetched.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, you must execute
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> until a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is returned, otherwise, the
unfetched rows will be returned as part of the result set for your next
query. The C API will give the error <CODE>Commands out of sync; you can't
run this command now</CODE> if you forget to do this!

</P>
<P>
You may not use <CODE>mysql_data_seek()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_row_seek()</CODE>,

fetched.)

<H3><A NAME="C_API_Prepared_statements" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_API_Prepared_statements">11.1.4  C API Prepared Statements</A></H3>

<P>
As of MySQL 4.1, the client/server protocol provides for the use of
prepared statements. This capability uses the
<CODE>MYSQL_STMT</CODE> statement handler data structure.
Prepared execution is an efficient way to execute a statement more than
once. The statement is first parsed to prepare it for execution. Then
it is executed one or more times at a later time, using the statement
handle returned by the prepare function.

</P>
<P>
Prepared execution is faster than direct execution for statements
executed more than once, primarly because the query is parsed only
once. In the case of direct execution, the query is parsed every
time it is executed. Prepared execution also can provide a reduction of network
traffic because for each execution of the prepared statement,
it is necessary only to send the data for the parameters.

</P>
<P>
Another advantage of prepared statements is that it uses a binary protocol
that makes data transfer between client and server more efficient.
Prepared statements also can support input and output binding for
multiple query execution.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="C_API_Prepared_statement_datatypes" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_API_Prepared_statement_datatypes">11.1.5  C API Prepared Statement Datatypes</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The API for prepared statements is still subject to revision.
This information is provided for early adopters, but please be aware that
the API may change.

</P>
<P>
Prepared statements mainly use the <CODE>MYSQL_STMT</CODE> and
<CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> data structures. A third structure, <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE>,
is used to transfer temporal data.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>MYSQL_STMT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1818"></A>
 
This structure represents a prepared statement.
A statement is prepared by calling
<CODE>mysql_prepare()</CODE>, which returns a statement handle, that is, a
pointer to a <CODE>MYSQL_STMT</CODE>.
The handle is used for all subsequent statement-related functions. 

The <CODE>MYSQL_STMT</CODE> structure has no members that are for application
use.

Multiple statement handles can be associated with a single connection.
The limit on the number of handles depends on the available system resources.

<A NAME="IDX1819"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE>
<DD>
This structure is used both for query input (data values sent to the server)
and output (result values returned from the server). For input, it is used with
<CODE>mysql_bind_param()</CODE> to bind parameter data values to buffers
for use by <CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE>. For output, it is used with
<CODE>mysql_bind_result()</CODE> to bind result set buffers for
use in fetching rows with <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE>.

The <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> structure contains the following members for
use by application programs.
Each is used both for input and for output, though sometimes for different
purposes depending on the direction of data transfer.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>enum enum_field_types buffer_type</CODE>
<DD>
The type of the buffer. The allowable <CODE>buffer_type</CODE> values are listed
later in this section. For input, <CODE>buffer_type</CODE> indicates what type of
value you are binding to a query parameter. For output, it indicates what type
of value you expect to receive in a result buffer.

<DT><CODE>void *buffer</CODE>
<DD>
For input, this is a pointer to the buffer in which a query parameter's data
value is stored. For output, it is
a pointer to the buffer in which to return a result set column value.
For numeric column types, <CODE>buffer</CODE> should point to a variable of the proper
C type.
(If you are associating the variable with a column that has the
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> attribute, the variable should be an <CODE>unsigned</CODE> C type.)
For date and time column types, <CODE>buffer</CODE> should point to a
<CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure.  For character and binary string column types,
<CODE>buffer</CODE> should point to a character buffer.

<DT><CODE>unsigned long buffer_length</CODE>
<DD>
The actual size of <CODE>*buffer</CODE> in bytes. This indicates the maximum amount
of data that can be stored in the buffer. For character and binary C data,
the <CODE>buffer_length</CODE> value specifies the length of <CODE>*buffer</CODE>
when used with <CODE>mysql_bind_param()</CODE>,
or the maximum number of data bytes that can be fetched into the buffer
when used with <CODE>mysql_bind_result()</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>unsigned long *length</CODE>
<DD>
A pointer to an <CODE>unsigned long</CODE> variable that indicates the actual number
of bytes of data stored in <CODE>*buffer</CODE>.
<CODE>length</CODE> is used for character or binary C data.
For input parameter data binding, <CODE>length</CODE>
points to an <CODE>unsigned long</CODE> variable that indicates the
length of the parameter value stored in <CODE>*buffer</CODE>; this is used by
<CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE>.
If <CODE>length</CODE> is a null pointer, the protocol assumes
that all character and binary data are null-terminated.
For output value binding, <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> places
the length of the column value that is returned
into the variable that <CODE>length</CODE> points to.

<CODE>length</CODE>
is ignored for numeric and temporal datatypes because the length
of the data value is determined by the <CODE>buffer_type</CODE> value.

<DT><CODE>my_bool *is_null</CODE>
<DD>
This member points to a <CODE>my_bool</CODE> variable that is true if a value is
<CODE>NULL</CODE>, false if it is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>. For input, set <CODE>*is_null</CODE>
to true to
indicate that you are passing a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value as a query parameter. For
output, this value will be set to true after you fetch a row if the result
value returned from the query is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</DL>

<A NAME="IDX1820"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE>
<DD>
This structure is used to send and receive <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>,
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> data directly to and from the server.
This is done by setting the <CODE>buffer_type</CODE> member of a <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE>
structure to one of the temporal types, and setting the <CODE>buffer</CODE> member
to point to a <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure.

The <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure contains the following members:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int year</CODE>
<DD>
The year.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int month</CODE>
<DD>
The month of the year.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int day</CODE>
<DD>
The day of the month.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int hour</CODE>
<DD>
The hour of the day.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int minute</CODE>
<DD>
The minute of the hour.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int second</CODE>
<DD>
The second of the minute.

<DT><CODE>my_bool neg</CODE>
<DD>
A boolean flag to indicate whether the time is negative.

<DT><CODE>unsigned long second_part</CODE>
<DD>
The fractional part of the second.
This member currently is unused.

</DL>

Only those parts of a <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure that apply to a given
type of temporal value are used:
The <CODE>year</CODE>, <CODE>month</CODE>, and <CODE>day</CODE> elements are used for
<CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values.
The <CODE>hour</CODE>, <CODE>minute</CODE>, and <CODE>second</CODE> elements are used for
<CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_date_handling">11.1.9  C API Handling of Date and Time Values</A>.

</DL>

<P>
The following table shows the allowable values that may be specified in the
<CODE>buffer_type</CODE> member of <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> structures.
The table also shows those SQL types that correspond most closely to each
<CODE>buffer_type</CODE> value, and, for numeric and temporal types, the
corresponding C type.

<H4>11.1.6.1  Execution Steps:</H4>

<P>
To prepare and execute a statement, an application follows these steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Call <CODE>mysql_prepare()</CODE> and pass it a string containing the SQL
statement. For a successful prepare operation, <CODE>mysql_prepare()</CODE> returns
a valid statement handle to the application.
<LI>

If the query produces a result set, call <CODE>mysql_get_metadata()</CODE>
to obtain the result set metadata.  This metadata is itself in the form of
result set, albeit a separate one from the one that contains the rows returned
by the query. The metadata result set indicates how many columns are in the
result and contains information about each column.
<LI>

Set the values of any parameters using <CODE>mysql_bind_param()</CODE>. All
parameters must be set. Otherwise, query execution will return an error or
produce unexpected results.
<LI>

Call <CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE> to execute the statement.
<LI>

If the query produces a result set,
bind the data buffers to use for retrieving the row values by calling
<CODE>mysql_bind_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

Fetch the data into the buffers row by row by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE>
repeatedly until no more rows are found.
<LI>

Repeat steps 3 through 6 as necessary, by changing the parameter values and
re-executing the statement.

</OL>

<P>
When <CODE>mysql_prepare()</CODE> is called, the MySQL client/server protocol
performs these actions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The server parses the query and sends the OK status back to the client by
assigning a statement ID. It also sends total number of parameters,
a column count, and its meta information if it is a result set oriented
query. All syntax and semantics of the query are checked by the server
during this call.
<LI>

The client uses this statement ID for the further operations, so that the server
can identify the statement from among its pool of statements. The client also
allocates a statement handle with this ID and returns the handle to the
application.
</UL>

<P>
When <CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE> is called, the MySQL client/server protocol
performs these actions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The client uses the statement handle and sends the parameter data to the
server.
<LI>

The server identifies the statement using the ID provided by the client,
replaces the parameter markers with the newly supplied data, and executes
the query. If the query produces a result set, the server sends the data back to
the client. Otherwise, it sends an OK status and total number of rows
changed, deleted, or inserted.
</UL>

<P>
When <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> is called, the MySQL client/server protocol
performs these actions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The client reads the data from the packet row by row and places it into the
application data buffers by doing the necessary conversions. If the
application buffer type is same as that of the field type returned from the
server, the conversions are straightforward.
</UL>

<P>
You can get the statement error code, error message, and SQLSTATE value using
<CODE>mysql_stmt_errno()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_stmt_error()</CODE>, and
<CODE>mysql_stmt_sqlstate()</CODE>, respectively.

<P>
<CODE>MYSQL_STMT * mysql_prepare(MYSQL *mysql, const char *query, unsigned

</P>

<H4>11.1.7.2  Description</H4>

<P>
Prepares the SQL query pointed to by the null-terminated string
<CODE>query</CODE>, and returns a statement handle to be used for further operations
on the statement. The query must consist of a single SQL statement. You should
not add a terminating semicolon (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) or <CODE>\g</CODE> to the statement.

</P>
<P>
The application can include one or more parameter markers in the SQL
statement by embedding question mark (<SAMP>`?'</SAMP>) characters into the SQL
string at the appropriate positions.

</P>
<P>
The markers are legal only in certain places in SQL statements. For
example, they are allowed in the <CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list of an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statement (to specify column values for a row), or in a comparison with a
column in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to specify a comparison value.
However, they are not allowed for identifiers (such as table or column
names), in the select list that names the columns to
be returned by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement), or to specify both
operands of a binary operator such as the <CODE>=</CODE> equal sign.
The latter restriction is necessary because it
would be impossible to determine the parameter type. In general,
parameters are legal only in Data Manipulation Languange (DML)
statements, and not in Data Defination Language (DDL) statements.

</P>
<P>
The parameter markers must be bound to application variables using
<CODE>mysql_bind_param()</CODE> before executing the statement.

</P>

<H4>11.1.7.12  Description</H4>

<P>
If a statement passed to <CODE>mysql_prepare()</CODE> is one that produces a result
set,
<CODE>mysql_get_metadata()</CODE> returns the result set metadata in the form of a
pointer to a
<CODE>MYSQL_RES</CODE> structure that can be used to process the

<H4>11.1.7.32  Description</H4>

<P>
<CODE>mysql_bind_result()</CODE> is used to associate (bind) columns in the
result set to data buffers and length buffers. When <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> is
called to fetch data, the MySQL client/server protocol places the data for the
bound columns into the specified buffers.

</P>
<P>
Note that all columns must be bound to buffers prior to calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE>.
<CODE>bind</CODE> is the address of an array of <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> structures.
The client library expects the array to contain
an element for each column of the result set.
Otherwise, <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> simply ignores
the data fetch. Also, the buffers should be large enough to hold the
data values, because the protocol doesn't return data values in chunks.

</P>
<P>
A column can be bound or rebound at any time, even after a result set has been
partially retrieved.  The new binding takes effect the next time
<CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> is called. Suppose an application binds
the columns in a result set and calls <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE>. The client/server
protocol returns data in the bound buffers. Then suppose the application
binds the columns to a different set of buffers. The protocol does
not place data into the newly bound
buffers until the next call to <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> occurs.

</P>
<P>
To bind a column, an application calls <CODE>mysql_bind_result()</CODE> and
passes the type, address, and the address of the length buffer.
The members of each <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> element that should be set are described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_Prepared_statement_datatypes">11.1.5  C API Prepared Statement Datatypes</A>.

<H4>11.1.7.37  Description</H4>

<P>
You must call <CODE>mysql_stmt_store_result()</CODE> for every query that
successfully produces a result set
(<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>), and only
if you want to buffer the complete result set by the client, so that the
subsequent <CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> call returns buffered data.

</P>
<P>
It is unnecessary to call <CODE>mysql_stmt_store_result()</CODE> for other
queries, but if you do, it will not harm or cause any notable performance in all
cases. You can detect whether the query produced a result set by checking
if <CODE>mysql_get_metadata()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>. For more information, refer
to section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_get_metadata">11.1.7.11  <CODE>mysql_get_metadata()</CODE></A>.

<P>
<CODE>mysql_fetch()</CODE> returns the next row in the result set. It can
be called only while the result set exists, that is, after a call to

<H3><A NAME="C_API_date_handling" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_API_date_handling">11.1.9  C API Handling of Date and Time Values</A></H3>

<P>
The new binary protocol available in MySQL 4.1 and above allows you to
send and receive date and time values (<CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>,
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>), using
the <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure. The members of this structure are described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_Prepared_statement_datatypes">11.1.5  C API Prepared Statement Datatypes</A>.

</P>
<P>
To send temporal data values, you create a prepared statement with
<CODE>mysql_prepare()</CODE>. Then, before calling <CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE> to execute
the statement, use the following procedure to set up each temporal parameter:

</P>

<OL>

<LI>

In the <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> structure associated with the data value, set the
<CODE>buffer_type</CODE> member to the type that indicates what kind of temporal
value you're sending. For
<CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIME</CODE>,
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE>,
or
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
values, set <CODE>buffer_type</CODE> to
<CODE>MYSQL_TYPE_DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>MYSQL_TYPE_TIME</CODE>,
<CODE>MYSQL_TYPE_DATETIME</CODE>,
or
<CODE>MYSQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP</CODE>,
respectively.

<LI>

Set the <CODE>buffer</CODE> member of the <CODE>MYSQL_BIND</CODE> structure to the address
of the <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure in which you will pass the temporal value.

<LI>

Fill in the members of the <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure that are appropriate
for the type of temporal value you're passing.
</OL>

<P>
Use <CODE>mysql_bind_param()</CODE> to bind the parameter data to the statement.
Then you can call <CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To retrieve temporal values, the procedure is similar, except that you set
the <CODE>buffer_type</CODE> member to the type of value you expect to receive, and
the <CODE>buffer</CODE> member to the address of a <CODE>MYSQL_TIME</CODE> structure into
which the returned value should be placed.
Use <CODE>mysql_bind_results()</CODE> to bind the buffers to the statement after
calling <CODE>mysql_execute()</CODE> and before fetching the results.

</P>
<P>
Here is a simple example that inserts <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, and
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> data.
The <CODE>mysql</CODE> variable is assumed to be a valid connection handle.

</P>

<PRE>

MYSQL_TIME  ts;

<H4>11.1.10.2  Description</H4>

<P>
This function needs to be called once in the program before calling any
MySQL function.  This initialises some global variables that MySQL
needs.  If you are using a thread-safe client library, this will also
call <CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> for this thread.

</P>
<P>
This is automatically called by <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE>,

This function needs to be called for each created thread to initialise
thread-specific variables.

</P>
<P>
This is automatically called by <CODE>my_init()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="C_Embedded_Server_func" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_Embedded_Server_func">11.1.11  C API Embedded Server Function Descriptions</A></H3>

<P>
You must use the following functions if you want to allow your

See section <A HREF="manual.html#libmysqld">11.1.15  libmysqld, the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the program is linked with <CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE> instead of
<CODE>-lmysqld</CODE>, these functions do nothing.  This makes it
possible to choose between using the embedded MySQL server and
a stand-alone server without modifying any code.

<P>
<CODE>int mysql_server_init(int argc, char **argv, char **groups)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>11.1.11.2  Description</H4>

<P>
This function <STRONG>must</STRONG> be called once in the program using the
embedded server before calling any other MySQL function.  It starts up
the server and initialises any subsystems (<CODE>mysys</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, etc.) 
that the server uses.  If this function is not called, the program will
crash.  If you are using the DBUG package that comes with MySQL, you
should call this after you have called <CODE>MY_INIT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>argc</CODE> and <CODE>argv</CODE> arguments are analogous to the arguments
to <CODE>main()</CODE>.  The first element of <CODE>argv</CODE> is ignored (it
typically contains the program name).  For convenience, <CODE>argc</CODE> may
be <CODE>0</CODE> (zero) if there are no command-line arguments for the
server.  <CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE> makes a copy of the arguments so
it's safe to destroy <CODE>argv</CODE> or <CODE>groups</CODE> after the call.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NULL</CODE>-terminated list of strings in <CODE>groups</CODE>
selects which groups in the option files will be active.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  For convenience, <CODE>groups</CODE> may be
<CODE>NULL</CODE>, in which case the <CODE>[server]</CODE> and <CODE>[emedded]</CODE> groups
will be active.

<P>
It is possible for <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> to return <CODE>NULL</CODE>
following a successful call to <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE>.  When this happens, it
means one of the following conditions occurred:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There was a <CODE>malloc()</CODE> failure (for example, if the result set was too
large).

<LI>

The data couldn't be read (an error occurred on the connection).

<LI>

The query returned no data (for example, it was an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
You can always check whether the statement should have produced a
non-empty result by calling <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>.  If
<CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> returns zero, the result is empty and the last
query was a statement that does not return values (for example, an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> or a <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> returns a
non-zero value, the statement should have produced a non-empty result.
See the description of the <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> function for an
example.

</P>
<P>
You can test for an error by calling <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>.

<H4><A NAME="Query_results" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_results">11.1.12.2  What Results Can I Get From a Query?</A></H4>

<P>
In addition to the result set returned by a query, you can also get the
following information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> returns the number of rows affected by the last
query when doing an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>. An
exception is that if <CODE>DELETE</CODE> is used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, the
table is re-created empty, which is much faster! In this case,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> returns zero for the number of records
affected.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> returns the number of rows in a result set.  With
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> may be called as soon as
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> returns.  With <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> may be called only after you have fetched all the
rows with <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> returns the ID generated by the last
query that inserted a row into a table with an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">11.1.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

Some queries (<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ...</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT INTO
... SELECT ...</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>) return additional information.  The result is
returned by <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>.  See the description for <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>
for the format of the string that it returns.  <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> returns a
<CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer if there is no additional information.

</P>
<P>
If you insert a record in a table containing a column that has the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> attribute, you can get the most recently generated
ID by calling the <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
You can also retrieve the ID by using the <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function in
a query string that you pass to <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check if an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index is used by executing
the following code. This also checks if the query was an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> with
an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index:

}
</PRE>

<P>
The most recently generated ID is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It will not
even be changed if you update another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not <CODE>0</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert
it into a second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
    VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)

<P>
If you compile MySQL clients that you've written yourself or that
you obtain from a third-party, they must be linked using the
<CODE>-lmysqlclient -lz</CODE> option on the link command.  You may also need to
specify a <CODE>-L</CODE> option to tell the linker where to find the library.  For
example, if the library is installed in <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/lib'</TT>, use
<CODE>-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lz</CODE> on the link command.

</P>
<P>
For clients that use MySQL header files, you may need to specify a
<CODE>-I</CODE> option when you compile them (for example,
<CODE>-I/usr/local/mysql/include</CODE>), so the compiler can find the header
files.

</P>
<P>
To make the above simpler on Unix we have provided the
<CODE>mysql_config</CODE> script for you. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_config">4.8.10  <CODE>mysql_config</CODE>, Get compile options for compiling clients</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1859"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1860"></A>

</P>
<P>
The client library is almost thread-safe. The biggest problem is
that the subroutines in <TT>`net.c'</TT> that read from sockets are not
interrupt safe.  This was done with the thought that you might want to
have your own alarm that can break a long read to a server.  If you
install interrupt handlers for the <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> interrupt,
the socket handling should be thread-safe.

</P>
<P>
New in 4.0.16: To not abort the program when a connection terminates,
MySQL blocks <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> on the first call to
<CODE>mysql_server_init</CODE>(), <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>.  If you want to have your own <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE>
handler, you should first call <CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE> and then
install your handler. In older versions of MySQL <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> was blocked,
but only in the thread safe client library, for every call to
<CODE>mysql_init()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In the older binaries we distribute on our web site
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>), the client libraries are not normally
compiled with the thread-safe option (the Windows binaries are by
default compiled to be thread-safe). Newer binary distributions should
have both a normal and a thread-safe client library.

</P>
<P>
To get a threaded client where you can interrupt the client from other
threads and set timeouts when talking with the MySQL server, you should
use the <CODE>-lmysys</CODE>, <CODE>-lmystrings</CODE>, and <CODE>-ldbug</CODE> libraries and
the <CODE>net_serv.o</CODE> code that the server uses.

</P>
<P>
If you don't need interrupts or timeouts, you can just compile a
thread-safe client library <CODE>(mysqlclient_r)</CODE> and use this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#C">11.1  MySQL C API</A>.  In this case you don't have to worry about the
<CODE>net_serv.o</CODE> object file or the other MySQL libraries.

</P>
<P>
When using a threaded client and you want to use timeouts and
interrupts, you can make great use of the routines in the
<TT>`thr_alarm.c'</TT> file.  If you are using routines from the
<CODE>mysys</CODE> library, the only thing you must remember is to call
<CODE>my_init()</CODE> first! See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_Thread_functions">11.1.10  C API Threaded Function Descriptions</A>.

</P>
<P>
All functions except <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> are by default
thread-safe.  The following notes describe how to compile a thread-safe
client library and use it in a thread-safe manner.  (The notes below for
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> actually apply to <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> as
well, but because <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> is deprecated, you should be
using <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> anyway.)

</P>
<P>
To make <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> thread-safe, you must recompile the
client library with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --enable-thread-safe-client
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a thread-safe client library <CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE>.
(Assuming your OS has a thread-safe <CODE>gethostbyname_r()</CODE> function.)
This library is thread-safe per connection.  You can let two threads
share the same connection with the following caveats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Two threads can't send a query to the MySQL server at the same time on
the same connection.  In particular, you have to ensure that between a
<CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> no other thread is using
the same connection.
<LI>

Many threads can access different result sets that are retrieved with
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>mysql_use_result</CODE>, you have to ensure that no other thread
is using the same connection until the result set is closed.
However, it really is best for threaded clients that share the same
connection to use <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

If you want to use multiple threads on the same connection, you must
have a mutex lock around your <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> call combination.  Once
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> is ready, the lock can be released and other
threads may query the same connection.
<LI>

If you program with POSIX threads, you can use
<CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> and <CODE>pthread_mutex_unlock()</CODE> to
establish and release a mutex lock.
</UL>

<P>
You need to know the following if you have a thread that is calling
MySQL functions which did not create the connection to the
MySQL database:

</P>
<P>
When you call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, MySQL will
create a thread-specific variable for the thread that is used by the
debug library (among other things).

</P>
<P>
If you call a MySQL function, before the thread has
called <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, the thread will
not have the necessary thread-specific variables in place and you are
likely to end up with a core dump sooner or later.

</P>
<P>
The get things to work smoothly you have to do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Call <CODE>my_init()</CODE> at the start of your program if it calls
any other MySQL function before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.
<LI>

Call <CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> in the thread handler before calling
any MySQL function.
<LI>

In the thread, call <CODE>mysql_thread_end()</CODE> before calling
<CODE>pthread_exit()</CODE>.  This will free the memory used by MySQL
thread-specific variables.
</OL>

<P>
You may get some errors because of undefined symbols when linking your
client with <CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE>. In most cases this is because you haven't
included the thread libraries on the link/compile line.

<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_overview" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_overview">11.1.15.1  Overview of the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A></H4>

<P>
The embedded MySQL server library makes it possible to run a
full-featured MySQL server inside a client application.  The
main benefits are increased speed and more simple management for
embedded applications.

</P>
<P>
The embedded server library is based on the client/server version of MySQL,
which is written in C/C++. Consequently, the embedded server also
is written in C/C++. There is no embedded server available in other
languages.

</P>
<P>
The API is identical for the embedded MySQL version and the
client/server version.  To change an old threaded application to use the
embedded library, you normally only have to add calls to the following
functions:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Function</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>When to call</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE> </TD><TD> Should be called before any other MySQL function is called, preferably early in the <CODE>main()</CODE> function.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql_server_end()</CODE> </TD><TD> Should be called before your program exits.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> </TD><TD> Should be called in each thread you create that will access MySQL.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql_thread_end()</CODE> </TD><TD> Should be called before calling <CODE>pthread_exit()</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Then you must link your code with <TT>`libmysqld.a'</TT> instead of <TT>`libmysqlclient.a'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The above <CODE>mysql_server_xxx</CODE> functions are also included in
<TT>`libmysqlclient.a'</TT> to allow you to change between the embedded and the
client/server version by just linking your application with the right
library. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_server_init">11.1.11.1  <CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE></A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_compiling" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_compiling">11.1.15.2  Compiling Programs with <CODE>libmysqld</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
To get a <CODE>libmysqld</CODE> library you should configure MySQL with the
<CODE>--with-embedded-server</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
When you link your program with <CODE>libmysqld</CODE>, you must also include
the system-specific <CODE>pthread</CODE> libraries and some libraries that
the MySQL server uses.  You can get the full list of libraries by executing
<CODE>mysql_config --libmysqld-libs</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The correct flags for compiling and linking a threaded program
must be used, even if you do not directly call any thread
functions in your code.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_restrictions" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_restrictions">11.1.15.3  Restrictions when using the Embedded MySQL Server</A></H4>

<P>
The embedded server has the following limitations:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

No support for ISAM tables. (This is mainly done to make the library smaller)
<LI>

No user defined functions (UDFs).
<LI>

No stack trace on core dump.
<LI>

No internal RAID support. (This is not normally needed as most OS has
nowadays support for big files).
<LI>

You cannot set this up as a server or a master (no replication).
<LI>

You can't connect to the embedded server from an outside process with
sockets or TCP/IP.
</UL>

<P>
Some of these limitations can be changed by editing the <TT>`mysql_embed.h'</TT>
include file and recompiling MySQL.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_options" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_options">11.1.15.4  Using Option Files with the Embedded Server</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1863"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following is the recommended way to use option files to make it easy
to switch between a client/server application and one where MySQL is
embedded. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Put common options in the <CODE>[server]</CODE> section. These will be read by
both MySQL versions.
<LI>

Put client/server-specific options in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section.
<LI>

Put embedded MySQL-specific options in the <CODE>[embedded]</CODE> section.
<LI>

Put application-specific options in a <CODE>[ApplicationName_SERVER]</CODE>
section.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_TODO" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_TODO">11.1.15.5  Things left to do in Embedded Server (TODO)</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1864"></A>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

We are going to provide options to leave out some parts of MySQL to make
the library smaller.
<LI>

There is still a lot of speed optimisation to do.
<LI>

Errors are written to <CODE>stderr</CODE>.  We will add an option to specify a
filename for these.
<LI>

We have to change <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> to not be so verbose when using in the embedded
version.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_example" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_example">11.1.15.6  A Simple Embedded Server Example</A></H4>

<P>
This example program and makefile should work without any
changes on a Linux or FreeBSD system.  For other operating
systems, minor changes will be needed.  This example is
designed to give enough details to understand the problem,
without the clutter that is a necessary part of a real

MySQL provides support for ODBC by means of the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>
program.  This chapter will teach you how to install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>,
and how to use it.  Here, you will also find a list of common programs that
are known to work with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Installing_MyODBC" HREF="manual_toc.html#Installing_MyODBC">11.2.1  How to Install MyODBC</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> 2.50 is a 32-bit ODBC 2.50 specification level 0 (with
level 1 and level 2 features) driver for connecting an ODBC-aware
application to MySQL.  <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> works on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000/XP
and most Unix platforms.
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> 3.51 is an enhanced version with ODBC 3.5x specification
level 1 (complete core API + level 2 features).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> is <CODE>Open Source</CODE>, and you can find the newest
version at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>.
Please note that the 2.50.x versions are <CODE>LGPL</CODE> licensed,
whereas the 3.51.x versions are <CODE>GPL</CODE> licensed.

</P>
<P>
If you have problem with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> and your program also works
with OLEDB, you should try the OLEDB driver.

</P>
<P>
Normally you only need to install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on Windows machines.
You only need <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> for Unix if you have a program like
ColdFusion that is running on the Unix machine and uses ODBC to connect
to the databases.

</P>
<P>
If you want to install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on a Unix box, you will also need
an ODBC manager.  <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> is known to work with
most of the Unix ODBC managers.

</P>
<P>
To install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on Windows, you should download the
appropriate <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> <TT>`.zip'</TT> file,
unpack it with <CODE>WinZIP</CODE> or some similar program,
and execute the <TT>`SETUP.EXE'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
On Windows/NT/XP you may get the following error when trying to install
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
An error occurred while copying C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MFC30.DLL. Restart
Windows and try installing again (before running any applications which
use ODBC)
</PRE>

<P>
The problem in this case is that some other program is using ODBC and
because of how Windows is designed, you may not in this case be able to
install a new ODBC drivers with Microsoft's ODBC setup program. In most
cases you can continue by just pressing <CODE>Ignore</CODE> to copy the rest
of the MyODBC files and the final installation should still work.  If
this doesn't work, the solution is to reboot your computer in ``safe
mode`` (Choose this by pressing F8 just before your machine starts
Windows during rebooting), install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>, and reboot to normal
mode.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To make a connection to a Unix box from a Windows box, with an ODBC
application (one that doesn't support MySQL natively), you must
first install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on the Windows machine.
<LI>

The user and Windows machine must have the access privileges to the
MySQL server on the Unix machine.  This is set up with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

You must create an ODBC DSN entry as follows:


<UL>
<LI>

Open the Control Panel on the Windows machine.
<LI>

Double-click the ODBC Data Sources 32-bit icon.
<LI>

Click the tab User DSN.
<LI>

Click the button Add.
<LI>

Select MySQL in the screen Create New Data Source and click
the Finish button.
<LI>

The MySQL Driver default configuration screen is shown.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC_administrator">11.2.2  How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program</A>.
</UL>

<LI>

Now start your application and select the ODBC driver with the DSN you
specified in the ODBC administrator.
</UL>

<P>
Notice that there are other configuration options on the screen of
MySQL (trace, don't prompt on connect, etc) that you can try if
you run into problems.

<UL>
<LI>

Use the IP address of the server.

<P>
The value for the <CODE>Windows DSN name</CODE> field is any name that is unique
in your Windows ODBC setup.

</P>
<P>
You don't have to specify values for the <CODE>Server</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>,
<CODE>Password</CODE>, or <CODE>Port</CODE> fields in the ODBC setup screen.
However, if you do, the values will be used as the defaults later when
you attempt to make a connection.  You have the option of changing the
values at that time.

</P>
<P>
If the port number is not given, the default port (3306)
is used.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the option <CODE>Read options from C:\my.cnf</CODE>, the groups
<CODE>client</CODE> and <CODE>odbc</CODE> will be read from the <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> file.
You can use all options that are usable by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1870"></A>

<DT>Access
<DD>
To make Access work:

<UL>
<LI>

If you are using Access 2000, you should get and install the newest
(version 2.6 or above) Microsoft MDAC (<CODE>Microsoft Data Access
Components</CODE>) from <a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/data/">http://www.microsoft.com/data/</a>.  This will fix
the following bug in Access: when you export data to MySQL, the
table and column names aren't specified.  Another way to around this bug
is to upgrade to MyODBC Version 2.50.33 and MySQL Version
3.23.x, which together provide a workaround for this bug!

You should also get and apply the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5)
which can be found here
<a HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP</a>.
This will fix some cases where columns are marked as <CODE>#deleted#</CODE>
in Access.

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22, you must to apply the
MDAC patch and use MyODBC 2.50.32 or 2.50.34 and above to go around
this problem.
<LI>

For all Access versions, you should enable the MyODBC option flag
<CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>. For Access 2.0, you should additionally enable
<CODE>Simulate ODBC 1.0</CODE>.
<LI>

You should have a timestamp in all tables you want to be able to update.
For maximum portability <CODE>TIMESTAMP(14)</CODE> or simple <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
is recommended instead of other <CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> variations.
<LI>

You should have a primary key in the table. If not, new or updated rows
may show up as <CODE>#DELETED#</CODE>.
<LI>

Only use <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> float fields. Access fails when comparing with
single floats.  The symptom usually is that new or updated rows may show
up as <CODE>#DELETED#</CODE> or that you can't find or update rows.
<LI>

If you are linking a table through MyODBC, which has <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> as
one of the column, then the results will be displayed as <CODE>#DELETED</CODE>. The
work around solution is:

<UL>
<LI>

Have one more dummy column with <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> as the datatype, preferably
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(14)</CODE>.
<LI>

Check the <CODE>'Change BIGINT columns to INT'</CODE> in connection options dialog in
ODBC DSN Administrator
<LI>

Delete the table link from access and re-create it.
</UL>

It still displays the previous records as <CODE>#DELETED#</CODE>, but newly
added/updated records will be displayed properly.
<LI>

If you still get the error <CODE>Another user has changed your data</CODE> after
adding a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column, the following trick may help you:

Don't use <CODE>table</CODE> data sheet view. Create instead a form with the
fields you want, and use that <CODE>form</CODE> data sheet view.  You should
set the <CODE>DefaultValue</CODE> property for the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to
<CODE>NOW()</CODE>.  It may be a good idea to hide the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column
from view so your users are not confused.
<LI>

In some cases, Access may generate illegal SQL queries that
MySQL can't understand. You can fix this by selecting
<CODE>"Query|SQLSpecific|Pass-Through"</CODE> from the Access menu.
<LI>

Access on NT will report <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns as <CODE>OLE OBJECTS</CODE>. If
you want to have <CODE>MEMO</CODE> columns instead, you should change the
column to <CODE>TEXT</CODE> with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
<LI>

Access can't always handle <CODE>DATE</CODE> columns properly. If you have a problem
with these, change the columns to <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>.
<LI>

If you have in Access a column defined as <CODE>BYTE</CODE>, Access will try
to export this as <CODE>TINYINT</CODE> instead of <CODE>TINYINT UNSIGNED</CODE>.
This will give you problems if you have values &#62; 127 in the column!
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1871"></A>
<DT>ADO
<DD>
When you are coding with the ADO API and <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> you need to put
attention in some default properties that aren't supported by the
MySQL server.  For example, using the <CODE>CursorLocation
Property</CODE> as <CODE>adUseServer</CODE> will return for the <CODE>RecordCount
Property</CODE> a result of -1. To have the right value, you need to set this
property to <CODE>adUseClient</CODE>, like is showing in the VB code here:


<PRE>
Dim myconn As New ADODB.Connection
Dim myrs As New Recordset
Dim mySQL As String
Dim myrows As Long

myconn.Open "DSN=MyODBCsample"
mySQL = "SELECT * from user"
myrs.Source = mySQL
Set myrs.ActiveConnection = myconn
myrs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
myrs.Open
myrows = myrs.RecordCount

myrs.Close
myconn.Close
</PRE>

Another workaround is to use a <CODE>SELECT COUNT(*)</CODE> statement
for a similar query to get the correct row count.

<DT>Active server pages (ASP)
<DD>
You should use the option flag <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<DT>BDE applications
<DD>
To get these to work, you should set the option flags
<CODE>Don't optimize column widths</CODE> and <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1872"></A>
<DT>Borland Builder 4
<DD>
When you start a query you can use the property <CODE>Active</CODE> or use the
method <CODE>Open</CODE>.  Note that <CODE>Active</CODE> will start by automatically
issuing a <CODE>SELECT * FROM ...</CODE> query that may not be a good thing if
your tables are big!
<DT>ColdFusion (On Unix)
<DD>
The following information is taken from the ColdFusion documentation:

Use the following information to configure ColdFusion Server for Linux
to use the unixODBC driver with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> for MySQL data
sources.  Allaire has verified that <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> Version 2.50.26
works with MySQL Version 3.22.27 and ColdFusion for Linux. (Any
newer version should also work.) You can download <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>

<A NAME="IDX1873"></A>
ColdFusion Version 4.5.1 allows you to us the ColdFusion Administrator
to add the MySQL data source. However, the driver is not
included with ColdFusion Version 4.5.1. Before the MySQL driver
will appear in the ODBC datasources drop-down list, you must build and
copy the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver to
<TT>`/opt/coldfusion/lib/libmyodbc.so'</TT>.

The Contrib directory contains the program <TT>`mydsn-xxx.zip'</TT> which allows
you to build and remove the DSN registry file for the MyODBC driver
on Coldfusion applications.

<A NAME="IDX1874"></A>
<DT>DataJunction
<DD>
You have to change it to output <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> rather than <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, as
it exports the latter in a manner that causes MySQL grief.
<A NAME="IDX1875"></A>
<DT>Excel
<DD>
Works. A few tips:

<UL>
<LI>

If you have problems with dates, try to select them as strings using the
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> function. For example:

<PRE>
select CONCAT(rise_time), CONCAT(set_time)
    from sunrise_sunset;
</PRE>

Values retrieved as strings this way should be correctly recognised
as time values by Excel97.

The purpose of <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> in this example is to fool ODBC into thinking
the column is of ``string type''. Without the <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>, ODBC knows the
column is of time type, and Excel does not understand that.

Note that this is a bug in Excel, because it automatically converts a
string to a time. This would be great if the source was a text file, but
is plain stupid when the source is an ODBC connection that reports
exact types for each column.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1876"></A>
<DT>Word
<DD>
To retrieve data from MySQL to Word/Excel documents, you need to
use the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver and the Add-in Microsoft Query help.

For example, create a db with a table containing 2 columns of text:


<UL>
<LI>

Insert rows using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client command-line tool.
<LI>

Create a DSN file using the ODBC manager, for example, <TT>`my'</TT> for the db above.
<LI>

Open the Word application.
<LI>

Create a blank new documentation.
<LI>

Using the tool bar called Database, press the button insert database.
<LI>

Press the button Get Data.
<LI>

At the right hand of the screen Get Data, press the button Ms Query.
<LI>

In the Ms Query create a New Data Source using the DSN file my.
<LI>

Select the new query.
<LI>

Select the columns that you want.
<LI>

Make a filter if you want.
<LI>

Make a Sort if you want.
<LI>

Select Return Data to Microsoft Word.
<LI>

Click Finish.
<LI>

Click Insert data and select the records.
<LI>

Click OK and you see the rows in your Word document.

Tested with BDE Version 3.0. The only known problem is that when the table

To be able to update a table, you must define a primary key for the table.

Visual Basic with ADO can't handle big integers. This means that some queries

the option <CODE>OPTION=16384</CODE> in the ODBC connect string or to set
the <CODE>Change BIGINT columns to INT</CODE> option in the MyODBC connect screen.
You may also want to set the <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE> option.

If you get the error <CODE>[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver does

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1881"></A>

</P>
<P>
A common problem is how to get the value of an automatically generated ID
from an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>. With ODBC, you can do something like this (assuming
that <CODE>auto</CODE> is an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> field):

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you are just going to insert the ID into another table, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_unique_ID">11.1.12.3  How Can I Get the Unique ID for the Last Inserted Row?</A>.

</P>
<P>
For the benefit of some ODBC applications (at least Delphi and Access),
the following query can be used to find a newly inserted row:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto IS NULL;
</PRE>

If you encounter difficulties with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>, you should start by
making a log file from the ODBC manager (the log you get when requesting
logs from ODBCADMIN) and a <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> log.

</P>
<P>
To get a <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> log, you need to do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Ensure that you are using <TT>`myodbcd.dll'</TT> and not <TT>`myodbc.dll'</TT>.
The easiest way to do this is to get <TT>`myodbcd.dll'</TT> from the MyODBC
distribution and copy it over the <TT>`myodbc.dll'</TT>, which is probably
in your <TT>`C:\windows\system32'</TT> or <TT>`C:\winnt\system32'</TT> directory.

Note that you probably want to restore the old myodbc.dll file when you
have finished testing, as this is a lot faster than <TT>`myodbcd.dll'</TT>.
<LI>

Tag the `Trace MyODBC' option flag in the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> connect/configure
screen.  The log will be written to file <TT>`C:\myodbc.log'</TT>.

If the trace option is not remembered when you are going back to the
above screen, it means that you are not using the <CODE>myodbcd.dll</CODE>
driver (see the item above).
<LI>

Start your application and try to get it to fail.
</OL>

<P>
Check the <CODE>MyODBC trace file</CODE>, to find out what could be wrong.
You should be able to find out the issued queries by searching after
the string <CODE>&#62;mysql_real_query</CODE> in the <TT>`myodbc.log'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
You should also try duplicating the queries in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> monitor
or <CODE>admndemo</CODE> to find out if the error is MyODBC or MySQL.

</P>
<P>
If you find out something is wrong, please only send the relevant rows
(max 40 rows) to the <CODE>myodbc</CODE> mailing list.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
Please never send the whole MyODBC or ODBC log file!

</P>
<P>
If you are unable to find out what's wrong, the last option is to
make an archive (tar or zip) that contains a MyODBC trace file, the ODBC
log file, and a README file that explains the problem.  You can send this
to <a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  Only we at
MySQL AB will have access to the files you upload, and we will
be very discrete with the data!

</P>
<P>
If you can create a program that also shows this problem, please
upload this too!

</P>
<P>
If the program works with some other SQL server, you should make an ODBC log
file where you do exactly the same thing in the other SQL server.

</P>
<P>
Remember that the more information you can supply to us, the more
likely it is that we can fix the problem!

The Perl methods are described in more detail in the following sections.
Variables used for method return values have these meanings:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$dbh</CODE>
<DD>
Database handle

<DT><CODE>$sth</CODE>
<DD>
Statement handle

<DT><CODE>$rc</CODE>
<DD>
Return code (often a status)

<DT><CODE>$rv</CODE>
<DD>
Return value (often a row count)
</DL>

<P>
<STRONG>Portable DBI Methods and Attributes</STRONG>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>connect($data_source, $username, $password)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1893"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1894"></A>
 
Use the <CODE>connect</CODE> method to make a database connection to the data
source. The <CODE>$data_source</CODE> value should begin with
<CODE>DBI:driver_name:</CODE>.
Example uses of <CODE>connect</CODE> with the <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> driver:

<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database", $user, $password);
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname",
                    $user, $password);
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname:$port",
                    $user, $password);
</PRE>

If the user name and/or password are undefined, <CODE>DBI</CODE> uses the
values of the <CODE>DBI_USER</CODE> and <CODE>DBI_PASS</CODE> environment variables,
respectively. If you don't specify a hostname, it defaults to
<CODE>'localhost'</CODE>. If you don't specify a port number, it defaults to the
default MySQL port (3306).

As of <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> Version 1.2009,
the <CODE>$data_source</CODE> value allows certain modifiers:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>mysql_read_default_file=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
Read <TT>`file_name'</TT> as an option file.  For information on option files,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<DT><CODE>mysql_read_default_group=group_name</CODE>
<DD>
The default group when reading an option file is normally the
<CODE>[client]</CODE> group.  By specifying the <CODE>mysql_read_default_group</CODE>
option, the default group becomes the <CODE>[group_name]</CODE> group.

<DT><CODE>mysql_compression=1</CODE>
<DD>
Use compressed communication between the client and server (MySQL
Version 3.22.3 or later).

<DT><CODE>mysql_socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the pathname of the Unix socket that is used to connect
to the server (MySQL Version 3.21.15 or later).
</DL>

Multiple modifiers may be given; each must be preceded by a semicolon.

For example, if you want to avoid hardcoding the user name and password into
a <CODE>DBI</CODE> script, you can take them from the user's <TT>`~/.my.cnf'</TT>
option file instead by writing your <CODE>connect</CODE> call like this:


<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf",
                $user, $password);
</PRE>

This call will read options defined for the <CODE>[client]</CODE> group in the
option file.  If you wanted to do the same thing but use options specified
for the <CODE>[perl]</CODE> group as well, you could use this:


<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf"
                . ";mysql_read_default_group=perl",
                $user, $password);
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1895"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1896"></A>
<DT><CODE>disconnect</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>disconnect</CODE> method disconnects the database handle from the database.
This is typically called right before you exit from the program.
Example:

<PRE>
$rc = $dbh-&#62;disconnect;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1897"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1898"></A>
<DT><CODE>prepare($statement)</CODE>
<DD>
Prepares an SQL statement for execution by the database engine
and returns a statement handle <CODE>($sth)</CODE>, which you can use to invoke
the <CODE>execute</CODE> method.

Typically you handle <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements (and <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like
statements such as <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>) by
means of <CODE>prepare</CODE> and <CODE>execute</CODE>.  Example:


<PRE>
$sth = $dbh-&#62;prepare($statement)
    or die "Can't prepare $statement: $dbh-&#62;errstr\n";
</PRE>

If you want to read big results to your client you can tell Perl to use
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> with:


<PRE>
my $sth = $dbh-&#62;prepare($statement { "mysql_use_result" =&#62; 1});
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1899"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1900"></A>
<DT><CODE>execute</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>execute</CODE> method executes a prepared statement. For
non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, <CODE>execute</CODE> returns the number of rows
affected.  If no rows are affected, <CODE>execute</CODE> returns <CODE>"0E0"</CODE>,
which Perl treats as zero but regards as true. If an error occurs,
<CODE>execute</CODE> returns <CODE>undef</CODE>. For <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements,
<CODE>execute</CODE> only starts the SQL query in the database; you need to use one
of the <CODE>fetch_*</CODE> methods described here to retrieve the data.
Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $sth-&#62;execute
          or die "can't execute the query: " . $sth-&#62;errstr;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1901"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1902"></A>
<DT><CODE>do($statement)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>do</CODE> method prepares and executes an SQL statement and returns the
number of rows affected.  If no rows are affected, <CODE>do</CODE> returns
<CODE>"0E0"</CODE>, which Perl treats as zero but regards as true.  This method is
generally used for non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements that cannot be prepared in
advance (due to driver limitations) or that do not need to be executed more
than once (inserts, deletes, etc.). Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $dbh-&#62;do($statement)
        or die "Can't execute $statement: $dbh- &#62;errstr\n";
</PRE>

Generally the 'do' statement is much faster (and is preferable)
than prepare/execute for statements that don't contain parameters.

<A NAME="IDX1903"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1904"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1905"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1906"></A>
<DT><CODE>quote($string)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>quote</CODE> method is used to "escape" any special characters contained in
the string and to add the required outer quotation marks.
Example:

<PRE>
$sql = $dbh-&#62;quote($string)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1907"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1908"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_array</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as an array of
field values.  Example:

<PRE>
while(@row = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_array) {
        print qw($row[0]\t$row[1]\t$row[2]\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1909"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1910"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_arrayref</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as a reference
to an array of field values. Example:

<PRE>
while($row_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_arrayref) {
        print qw($row_ref-&#62;[0]\t$row_ref-&#62;[1]\t$row_ref-&#62;[2]\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1911"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1912"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_hashref</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches a row of data and returns a reference to a hash
table containing field name/value pairs. This method is not nearly as
efficient as using array references as demonstrated above. Example:

<PRE>
while($hash_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_hashref) {
        print qw($hash_ref-&#62;{firstname}\t$hash_ref-&#62;{lastname}\t\
                $hash_ref-&#62;{title}\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1913"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1914"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchall_arrayref</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used to get all the data (rows) to be returned from the
SQL statement. It returns a reference to an array of references to arrays
for each row. You access or print the data by using a nested
loop. Example:

<PRE>
my $table = $sth-&#62;fetchall_arrayref
                or die "$sth-&#62;errstr\n";
my($i, $j);
for $i ( 0 .. $#{$table} ) {
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$table-&#62;[$i]} ) {
                print "$table-&#62;[$i][$j]\t";
        }
        print "\n";
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1915"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1916"></A>
<DT><CODE>finish</CODE>
<DD>
Indicates that no more data will be fetched from this statement
handle. You call this method to free up the statement handle and any
system resources associated with it.  Example:

<PRE>
$rc = $sth-&#62;finish;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1917"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1918"></A>
<DT><CODE>rows</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number of rows changed (updated, deleted, etc.) by the last
command.  This is usually used after a non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> <CODE>execute</CODE>
statement.  Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $sth-&#62;rows;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1919"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1920"></A>
<DT><CODE>NULLABLE</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of values that indicate whether columns may
contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
The possible values for each array element are 0 or the empty string if the
column cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, 1 if it can, and 2 if the column's <CODE>NULL</CODE>
status is unknown.
Example:

<PRE>
$null_possible = $sth-&#62;{NULLABLE};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1921"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1922"></A>
<DT><CODE>NUM_OF_FIELDS</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute indicates
the number of fields returned by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>
statement.  You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a
result: A zero value indicates a non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement like
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$nr_of_fields = $sth-&#62;{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1923"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1924"></A>
<DT><CODE>data_sources($driver_name)</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns an array containing names of databases available to the
MySQL server on the host <CODE>'localhost'</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
@dbs = DBI-&#62;data_sources("mysql");
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1925"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1926"></A>
<DT><CODE>ChopBlanks</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute determines whether the <CODE>fetchrow_*</CODE> methods will chop
leading and trailing blanks from the returned values.
Example:

<PRE>
$sth-&#62;{'ChopBlanks'} =1;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1927"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1928"></A>
<DT><CODE>trace($trace_level)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>trace($trace_level, $trace_filename)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>trace</CODE> method enables or disables tracing.  When invoked as a
<CODE>DBI</CODE> class method, it affects tracing for all handles.  When invoked as
a database or statement handle method, it affects tracing for the given
handle (and any future children of the handle).  Setting <CODE>$trace_level</CODE>
to 2 provides detailed trace information.  Setting <CODE>$trace_level</CODE> to 0
disables tracing.  Trace output goes to the standard error output by
default.  If <CODE>$trace_filename</CODE> is specified, the file is opened in
append mode and output for <STRONG>all</STRONG> traced handles is written to that
file.  Example:

<PRE>
DBI-&#62;trace(2);                # trace everything
DBI-&#62;trace(2,"/tmp/dbi.out"); # trace everything to
                              # /tmp/dbi.out
$dth-&#62;trace(2);               # trace this database handle
$sth-&#62;trace(2);               # trace this statement handle
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1929"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1930"></A>
You can also enable <CODE>DBI</CODE> tracing by setting the <CODE>DBI_TRACE</CODE>
environment variable.  Setting it to a numeric value is equivalent to calling
<CODE>DBI-&#62;(value)</CODE>.  Setting it to a pathname is equivalent to calling
<CODE>DBI-&#62;(2,value)</CODE>.

</DL>

<STRONG>MySQL-specific Methods and Attributes</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
The methods shown here are MySQL-specific and not part of the
<CODE>DBI</CODE> standard.  Several of them are now deprecated:
<CODE>is_blob</CODE>, <CODE>is_key</CODE>, <CODE>is_num</CODE>, <CODE>is_pri_key</CODE>,
<CODE>is_not_null</CODE>, <CODE>length</CODE>, <CODE>max_length</CODE>, and <CODE>table</CODE>.
Where <CODE>DBI</CODE>-standard alternatives exist, they are noted here:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>mysql_insertid</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1931"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1932"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1933"></A>
 
If you use the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> feature of MySQL, the new
auto-incremented values will be stored here.
Example:

<PRE>
$new_id = $sth-&#62;{mysql_insertid};
</PRE>

With old versions of the DBI interface, you could use <CODE>$sth-&#62;{'insertid'}</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1934"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1935"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_blob</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column is a <CODE>BLOB</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$keys = $sth-&#62;{is_blob};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1936"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1937"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_key</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column is a key.
Example:

<PRE>
$keys = $sth-&#62;{is_key};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1938"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1939"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_num</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column contains numeric values.
Example:

<PRE>
$nums = $sth-&#62;{is_num};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1940"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1941"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_pri_key</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the respective column is a primary key.
Example:

<PRE>
$pri_keys = $sth-&#62;{is_pri_key};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1942"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1943"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_not_null</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of FALSE indicates that this column may contain <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values.
Example:

<PRE>
$not_nulls = $sth-&#62;{is_not_null};
</PRE>

<CODE>is_not_null</CODE> is deprecated; it is preferable to use the
<CODE>NULLABLE</CODE> attribute (described above), because that is a DBI standard.

<A NAME="IDX1944"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1945"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1946"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1947"></A>
<DT><CODE>length</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>max_length</CODE>
<DD>
Each of these methods returns a reference to an array of column sizes.  The
<CODE>length</CODE> array indicates the maximum possible sizes that each column may
be (as declared in the table description).  The <CODE>max_length</CODE> array
indicates the maximum sizes actually present in the result table.  Example:


<PRE>
$lengths = $sth-&#62;{length};
$max_lengths = $sth-&#62;{max_length};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1948"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1949"></A>
<DT><CODE>NAME</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of column names.
Example:

<PRE>
$names = $sth-&#62;{NAME};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1950"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1951"></A>
<DT><CODE>table</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of table names.
Example:

<PRE>
$tables = $sth-&#62;{table};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1952"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1953"></A>
<DT><CODE>type</CODE>

This chapter describes a lot of things that you need to know when
working on the MySQL code. If you plan to contribute to MySQL
development, want to have access to the bleeding-edge in-between
versions code, or just want to keep track of development, follow the
instructions in section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source_tree">2.3.4  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.
If you are interested in MySQL internals, you should also subscribe
to our <CODE>internals</CODE> mailing list. This list is relatively low
traffic. For details on how to subscribe, please see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
All developers at MySQL AB are on the <CODE>internals</CODE> list and we
help other people who are working on the MySQL code. Feel free to
use this list both to ask questions about the code and to send
patches that you would like to contribute to the MySQL project!

</P>



<H3><A NAME="MySQL_threads" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_threads">13.1.1  MySQL Threads</A></H3>

<P>
The MySQL server creates the following threads:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The TCP/IP connection thread handles all connection requests and
creates a new dedicated thread to handle the authentication and
SQL query processing for each connection.

<LI>

On Windows NT there is a named pipe handler thread that does the same work as
the TCP/IP connection thread on named pipe connect requests.

<LI>

The signal thread handles all signals.  This thread also normally handles
alarms and calls <CODE>process_alarm()</CODE> to force timeouts on connections
that have been idle too long.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is compiled with <CODE>-DUSE_ALARM_THREAD</CODE>, a dedicated
thread that handles alarms is created.  This is only used on some systems where
there are problems with <CODE>sigwait()</CODE> or if one wants to use the
<CODE>thr_alarm()</CODE> code in ones application without a dedicated signal
handling thread.

<LI>

If one uses the <CODE>--flush_time=#</CODE> option, a dedicated thread is created
to flush all tables at the given interval.

<LI>

Every connection has its own thread.

<LI>

Every different table on which one uses <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> gets its
own thread.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>--master-host</CODE>, a slave replication thread will be
started to read and apply updates from the master.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> only shows the connection, <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>,
and replication threads.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="MySQL_test_suite" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_test_suite">13.1.2  MySQL Test Suite</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1963"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1964"></A>

</P>
<P>
Until recently, our main full-coverage test suite was based on proprietary
customer data and for that reason has not been publicly available. The only
publicly available part of our testing process consisted of the <CODE>crash-me</CODE>
test, a Perl DBI/DBD benchmark found in the <CODE>sql-bench</CODE> directory, and
miscellaneous tests located in <CODE>tests</CODE> directory. The lack of a
standardised publicly available test suite has made it difficult for our users,
as well developers, to do regression tests on the MySQL code. To
address this problem, we have created a new test system that is included in
the source and binary distributions starting in Version 3.23.29.

</P>
<P>
The current set of test cases doesn't test everything in MySQL, but it
should catch most obvious bugs in the SQL processing code, OS/library
issues, and is quite thorough in testing replication.  Our eventual goal
is to have the tests cover 100% of the code.  We welcome contributions
to our test suite.  You may especially want to contribute tests that
examine the functionality critical to your system, as this will ensure
that all future MySQL releases will work well with your
applications.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="running_mysqltest" HREF="manual_toc.html#running_mysqltest">13.1.2.1  Running the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
The test system consist of a test language interpreter
(<CODE>mysqltest</CODE>), a shell script to run all
tests(<CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>), the actual test cases written in a special
test language, and their expected results.  To run the test suite on
your system after a build, type <CODE>make test</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql-test/mysql-test-run</CODE> from the source root.  If you have
installed a binary distribution, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the install root
(eg. <CODE>/usr/local/mysql</CODE>), and do <CODE>scripts/mysql-test-run</CODE>.
All tests should succeed.  If not, you should try to find out why and
report the problem if this is a bug in MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reporting_mysqltest_bugs">13.1.2.3  Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have a copy of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> running on the machine where you want to
run the test suite you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not using
ports <CODE>9306</CODE> and <CODE>9307</CODE>.  If one of those ports is taken, you should
edit <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> and change the values of the master and/or slave
port to one that is available.

</P>
<P>
You can run one individual test case with
<CODE>mysql-test/mysql-test-run test_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If one test fails, you should test running <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with
the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to check if any other tests fails.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="extending_mysqltest" HREF="manual_toc.html#extending_mysqltest">13.1.2.2  Extending the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>mysqltest</CODE> language to write your own test cases.
Unfortunately, we have not yet written full documentation for it.
You can, however, look at our current test cases and use
them as an example.  The following points should help you get started:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The tests are located in <CODE>mysql-test/t/*.test</CODE>

<LI>

A test case consists of <CODE>;</CODE> terminated statements and is similar to the
input of <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line client.  A statement by default is a query
to be sent to MySQL server, unless it is recognised as internal
command (eg. <CODE>sleep</CODE>).

<LI>

All queries that produce results--for example, <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>,
<CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, etc., must be preceded with <CODE>@/path/to/result/file</CODE>.  The
file must contain the expected results.  An easy way to generate the result
file is to run <CODE>mysqltest -r &#60; t/test-case-name.test</CODE> from
<CODE>mysql-test</CODE> directory, and then edit the generated result files, if
needed, to adjust them to the expected output.  In that case, be very careful
about not adding or deleting any invisible characters - make sure to only
change the text and/or delete lines.  If you have to insert a line, make sure
the fields are separated with a hard tab, and there is a hard tab at the end.
You may want to use <CODE>od -c</CODE> to make sure your text editor has not messed
anything up during edit.  We, of course, hope that you will never have to edit
the output of <CODE>mysqltest -r</CODE> as you only have to do it when you find a
bug.

<LI>

To be consistent with our setup, you should put your result files in
<CODE>mysql-test/r</CODE> directory and name them <CODE>test_name.result</CODE>.  If the
test produces more than one result, you should use <CODE>test_name.a.result</CODE>,
<CODE>test_name.b.result</CODE>, etc.

<LI>

If a statement returns an error, you should on the line before the statement
specify with the <CODE>--error error-number</CODE>.  The error number can be
a list of possible error numbers separated with <CODE>','</CODE>.

<LI>

If you are writing a replication test case, you should on the first line of
the test file, put <CODE>source include/master-slave.inc;</CODE>.  To switch between
master and slave, use <CODE>connection master;</CODE> and <CODE>connection slave;</CODE>.
If you need to do something on an alternate connection, you can do
<CODE>connection master1;</CODE> for the master, and <CODE>connection slave1;</CODE> for
the slave.

<LI>

If you need to do something in a loop, you can use something like this:

<PRE>
let $1=1000;
while ($1)
{
 # do your queries here
 dec $1;
}
</PRE>

<LI>

To sleep between queries, use the <CODE>sleep</CODE> command. It supports fractions
of a second, so you can do <CODE>sleep 1.3;</CODE>, for example, to sleep 1.3
seconds.

<LI>

To run the slave with additional options for your test case, put them
in the command-line format in <CODE>mysql-test/t/test_name-slave.opt</CODE>. For
the master, put them in <CODE>mysql-test/t/test_name-master.opt</CODE>.

<LI>

If you have a question about the test suite, or have a test case to contribute,
e-mail to the MySQL internals mailing list.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
As this list does not accept
attachments, you should ftp all the relevant files to:
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/Incoming/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/Incoming/</a>

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Reporting_mysqltest_bugs" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reporting_mysqltest_bugs">13.1.2.3  Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
If your MySQL version doesn't pass the test suite you should
do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Don't send a bug report before you have found out as much as possible of
what when wrong!  When you do it, please use the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script
so that we can get information about your system and <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
version. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.
<LI>

Make sure to include the output of <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>, as well as
contents of all <CODE>.reject</CODE> files in <CODE>mysql-test/r</CODE> directory.
<LI>

If a test in the test suite fails, check if the test fails also when run
by its own:


<PRE>
cd mysql-test
mysql-test-run --local test-name
</PRE>

If this fails, then you should configure MySQL with
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE> and run <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the
<CODE>--debug</CODE> option. If this also fails send the trace file
<TT>`var/tmp/master.trace'</TT> to ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret
so that we can examine it. Please remember to also include a full
description of your system, the version of the mysqld binary and how you
compiled it.

<LI>

Try also to run <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to
see if there is any other test that fails.

<LI>

If you have compiled MySQL yourself, check our manual for how
to compile MySQL on your platform or, preferable, use one of
the binaries we have compiled for you at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.  All our standard binaries should
pass the test suite !

<LI>

If you get an error, like <CODE>Result length mismatch</CODE> or <CODE>Result
content mismatch</CODE> it means that the output of the test didn't match
exactly the expected output. This could be a bug in MySQL or
that your mysqld version produces slight different results under some
circumstances.

Failed test results are put in a file with the same base name as the
result file with the <CODE>.reject</CODE> extension.  If your test case is
failing, you should do a diff on the two files.  If you cannot see how
they are different, examine both with <CODE>od -c</CODE> and also check their
lengths.

<LI>

If a test fails totally, you should check the logs file in the
<CODE>mysql-test/var/log</CODE> directory for hints of what went wrong.

<LI>

If you have compiled MySQL with debugging you can try to debug this
by running <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the <CODE>--gdb</CODE> and/or <CODE>--debug</CODE>
options.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

If you have not compiled MySQL for debugging you should probably
do that.  Just specify the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> options to <CODE>configure</CODE>!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1969"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are two ways to add new functions to MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>You can add the function through the user-definable function (UDF)

interface.  User-definable functions are added and removed dynamically using
the <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_FUNCTION">13.2.1  <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION/DROP FUNCTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>You can add the function as a native (built in) MySQL function.

Native functions are compiled into the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and become
available on a permanent basis.
</UL>

<P>
Each method has advantages and disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you write a user-definable function, you must install the object file
in addition to the server itself.  If you compile your function into the
server, you don't need to do that.
<LI>

You can add UDFs to a binary MySQL distribution.  Native functions
require you to modify a source distribution.
<LI>

If you upgrade your MySQL distribution, you can continue to use your
previously installed UDFs.  For native functions, you must repeat your
modifications each time you upgrade.
</UL>

<P>
Whichever method you use to add new functions, they may be used just like
native functions such as <CODE>ABS()</CODE> or <CODE>SOUNDEX()</CODE>.

</P>

A user-definable function (UDF) is a way to extend MySQL with a new
function that works like native (built in) MySQL function such as
<CODE>ABS()</CODE> and <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> is a new option for MySQL Version 3.23.  An
<CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> function works exactly like a native MySQL
<CODE>GROUP</CODE> function like <CODE>SUM</CODE> or <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> saves the function's name, type, and shared library
name in the <CODE>mysql.func</CODE> system table.  You must have the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database
to create and drop functions.

</P>
<P>
All active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  In
this case, UDF initialisation is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.
(An active function is one that has been loaded with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE>
and not removed with <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
For instructions on writing user-definable functions, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Adding_functions">13.2  Adding New Functions to MySQL</A>.  For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or
C++, your operating system must support dynamic loading and you must have
compiled <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dynamically (not statically).

</P>
<P>
Note that to make <CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> work, you must have a
<CODE>mysql.func</CODE> table that contains the column <CODE>type</CODE>.  If you do not
have this table, you should run the script
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> to create it.

</P>

</P>

<P>
For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or C++ and your
operating system must support dynamic loading.  The MySQL source
distribution includes a file <TT>`sql/udf_example.cc'</TT> that defines 5 new
functions.  Consult this file to see how UDF calling conventions work.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be able to use UDF functions, you should configure MySQL
with <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic</CODE> The reason is that to on
many platforms (including Linux) you can load a dynamic library (with
<CODE>dlopen()</CODE>) from a static linked program, which you would get if
you are using <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static</CODE> If you want to
use an UDF that needs to access symbols from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> (like the
<CODE>metaphone</CODE> example in <TT>`sql/udf_example.cc'</TT> that uses
<CODE>default_charset_info</CODE>), you must link the program with
<CODE>-rdynamic</CODE> (see <CODE>man dlopen</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
If you are using a precompiled version of the server, use MySQL-Max,
which supports dynamic loading.

</P>
<P>
For each function that you want to use in SQL statements, you should define
corresponding C (or C++) functions.  In the discussion below, the name
``xxx'' is used for an example function name.  To distinguish between SQL and
C/C++ usage, <CODE>XXX()</CODE> (uppercase) indicates an SQL function call, and
<CODE>xxx()</CODE> (lowercase) indicates a C/C++ function call.

</P>
<P>
The C/C++ functions that you write to implement the interface for
<CODE>XXX()</CODE> are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>xxx()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
The main function.  This is where the function result is computed.
The correspondence between the SQL type and return type of your C/C++
function is shown here:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>SQL type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>C/C++ type</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>STRING</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>char *</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>INTEGER</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>long long</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>REAL</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>double</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<DT><CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> (optional)
<DD>
The initialisation function for <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  It can be used to:


<UL>
<LI>

Check the number of arguments to <CODE>XXX()</CODE>.
<LI>

Check that the arguments are of a required type or, alternatively,
tell MySQL to coerce arguments to the types you want when
the main function is called.
<LI>

Allocate any memory required by the main function.
<LI>

Specify the maximum length of the result.
<LI>

Specify (for <CODE>REAL</CODE> functions) the maximum number of decimals.
<LI>

Specify whether the result can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<DT><CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> (optional)
<DD>
The deinitialisation function for <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  It should deallocate any
memory allocated by the initialisation function.
</DL>

<P>
When an SQL statement invokes <CODE>XXX()</CODE>, MySQL calls the
initialisation function <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> to let it perform any required
setup, such as argument checking or memory allocation.  If <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>
returns an error, the SQL statement is aborted with an error message and the
main and deinitialisation functions are not called.  Otherwise, the main
function <CODE>xxx()</CODE> is called once for each row.  After all rows have been
processed, the deinitialisation function <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> is called so it
can perform any required cleanup.

</P>
<P>
For aggregate functions (like <CODE>SUM()</CODE>), you must also provide the
following functions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
Reset sum and insert the argument as the initial value for a new group.
<DT><CODE>xxx_add()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
Add the argument to the old sum.
</DL>

<P>
When using aggregate UDFs, MySQL works the following way:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Call <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> to let the aggregate function allocate the memory it
will need to store results.
<LI>

Sort the table according to the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> expression.
<LI>

For the first row in a new group, call the <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE> function.
<LI>

For each new row that belongs in the same group, call the
<CODE>xxx_add()</CODE> function.
<LI>

When the group changes or after the last row has been processed,
call <CODE>xxx()</CODE> to get the result for the aggregate.
<LI>

Repeat 3-5 until all rows has been processed
<LI>

Call <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> to let the UDF free any memory it has allocated.
</OL>

<P>
All functions must be thread-safe (not just the main function,
but the initialisation and deinitialisation functions as well). This means
that you are not allowed to allocate any global or static variables that
change!  If you need memory, you should allocate it in <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>
and free it in <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE>.

</P>

<P>
The main function should be declared as shown here.  Note that the return
type and parameters differ, depending on whether you will declare the SQL
function <CODE>XXX()</CODE> to return <CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, or <CODE>REAL</CODE>
in the <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> statement:

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>STRING</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
          char *result, unsigned long *length,
          char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
long long xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>REAL</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
double xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
The initialisation and deinitialisation functions are declared like this:

</P>

<PRE>
my_bool xxx_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *message);

void xxx_deinit(UDF_INIT *initid);
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>initid</CODE> parameter is passed to all three functions.  It points to a
<CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure that is used to communicate information between
functions.  The <CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure members are listed below.  The
initialisation function should fill in any members that it wishes to change.
(To use the default for a member, leave it unchanged.):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>my_bool maybe_null</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> should set <CODE>maybe_null</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>xxx()</CODE>
can return <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  The default value is <CODE>1</CODE> if any of the
arguments are declared <CODE>maybe_null</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int decimals</CODE>
<DD>
Number of decimals.  The default value is the maximum number of decimals in
the arguments passed to the main function.  (For example, if the function is
passed <CODE>1.34</CODE>, <CODE>1.345</CODE>, and <CODE>1.3</CODE>, the default would be 3,
because <CODE>1.345</CODE> has 3 decimals.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int max_length</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum length of the string result.  The default value differs depending
on the result type of the function.  For string functions, the default is the
length of the longest argument.  For integer functions, the default is 21
digits.  For real functions, the default is 13 plus the number of decimals
indicated by <CODE>initid-&#62;decimals</CODE>.  (For numeric functions, the length
includes any sign or decimal point characters.)

If you want to return a blob, you can set this to 65K or 16M; this
memory is not allocated but used to decide which column type to use if
there is a need to temporary store the data.

<DT><CODE>char *ptr</CODE>
<DD>
A pointer that the function can use for its own purposes.  For example,
functions can use <CODE>initid-&#62;ptr</CODE> to communicate allocated memory
between functions.  In <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>, allocate the memory and assign it
to this pointer:


<PRE>
initid-&#62;ptr = allocated_memory;
</PRE>

In <CODE>xxx()</CODE> and <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE>, refer to <CODE>initid-&#62;ptr</CODE> to use
or deallocate the memory.

</P>
<P>
Here follows a description of the different functions you need to define
when you want to create an aggregate UDF function.

</P>
<P>
Note that the following function is NOT needed or used by MySQL 4.1.1.
You can keep still have define his function if you want to have your
code work with both MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 4.1.1

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx_reset(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
                char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
This function is called when MySQL finds the first row in a new group.
In the function you should reset any internal summary variables and then set
the given argument as the first argument in the group.

</P>
<P>
In many cases this is implemented internally by reseting all variables
(for example by calling <CODE>xxx_clear()</CODE> and then calling
<CODE>xxx_add()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The following function is only required by MySQL 4.1.1 and above:

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx_clear(UDF_INIT *initid, char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
This function is called when MySQL needs to reset the summary results.
This will be called at the beginning for each new group but can also be
called to reset the values for a query where there was no matching rows.
<CODE>is_null</CODE> will be set to point to <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> before calling
<CODE>xxx_clear()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>error</CODE> pointer to store a byte if something went
wrong .

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx_add(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
This function is called for all rows that belongs to the same group,
except for the first row. In this you should add the value in UDF_ARGS
to your internal summary variable.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>xxx()</CODE> function should be declared identical as when you
define a simple UDF function. See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_calling">13.2.2.1  UDF Calling Sequences for simple functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
This function is called when all rows in the group has been processed.
You should normally never access the <CODE>args</CODE> variable here but
return your value based on your internal summary variables.

</P>
<P>
All argument processing in <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE> and <CODE>xxx_add()</CODE>
should be done identically as for normal UDFs. See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_arguments">13.2.2.3  Argument Processing</A>.

</P>
<P>
The return value handling in <CODE>xxx()</CODE> should be done identically as
for a normal UDF. See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_return_values">13.2.2.4  Return Values and Error Handling</A>.

</P>
<P>
The pointer argument to <CODE>is_null</CODE> and <CODE>error</CODE> is the same for
all calls to <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE>, <CODE>xxx_clear()</CODE>, <CODE>xxx_add()</CODE> and
<CODE>xxx()</CODE>.
You can use this to remember that you got an error or if the <CODE>xxx()</CODE>
function should return <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Note that you should not store a string
into <CODE>*error</CODE>!  This is just a 1 byte flag!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>is_null</CODE> is reset for each group (before calling <CODE>xxx_clear()</CODE>
<CODE>error</CODE> is never reset.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>isnull</CODE> or <CODE>error</CODE> are set after <CODE>xxx()</CODE> then MySQL
will return <CODE>NULL</CODE> as the result for the group function.

</P>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>args</CODE> parameter points to a <CODE>UDF_ARGS</CODE> structure that has the
members listed here:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int arg_count</CODE>
<DD>
The number of arguments.  Check this value in the initialisation function
if you want your function to be called with a particular number of arguments.
For example:


<PRE>
if (args-&#62;arg_count != 2)
{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires two arguments");
    return 1;
}
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>enum Item_result *arg_type</CODE>
<DD>
The types for each argument.  The possible type values are
<CODE>STRING_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE>, and <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>.

To make sure that arguments are of a given type and return an
error if they are not, check the <CODE>arg_type</CODE> array in the initialisation
function.  For example:


<PRE>
if (args-&#62;arg_type[0] != STRING_RESULT ||
    args-&#62;arg_type[1] != INT_RESULT)
{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires a string and an integer");
    return 1;
}
</PRE>

As an alternative to requiring your function's arguments to be of particular
types, you can use the initialisation function to set the <CODE>arg_type</CODE>
elements to the types you want.  This causes MySQL to coerce
arguments to those types for each call to <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  For example, to
specify coercion of the first two arguments to string and integer, do this in
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>:


<PRE>
args-&#62;arg_type[0] = STRING_RESULT;
args-&#62;arg_type[1] = INT_RESULT;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>char **args</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>args-&#62;args</CODE> communicates information to the initialisation function
about the general nature of the arguments your function was called with.  For a
constant argument <CODE>i</CODE>, <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> points to the argument
value.  (See below for instructions on how to access the value properly.)
For a non-constant argument, <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> is <CODE>0</CODE>.
A constant argument is an expression that uses only constants, such as
<CODE>3</CODE> or <CODE>4*7-2</CODE> or <CODE>SIN(3.14)</CODE>.  A non-constant argument is an
expression that refers to values that may change from row to row, such as
column names or functions that are called with non-constant arguments.

For each invocation of the main function, <CODE>args-&#62;args</CODE> contains the
actual arguments that are passed for the row currently being processed.

Functions can refer to an argument <CODE>i</CODE> as follows:


<UL>
<LI>

An argument of type <CODE>STRING_RESULT</CODE> is given as a string pointer plus a
length, to allow handling of binary data or data of arbitrary length.  The
string contents are available as <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> and the string length
is <CODE>args-&#62;lengths[i]</CODE>.  You should not assume that strings are
null-terminated.

<LI>

For an argument of type <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE>, you must cast
<CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> to a <CODE>long long</CODE> value:


<PRE>
long long int_val;
int_val = *((long long*) args-&#62;args[i]);
</PRE>

<LI>

For an argument of type <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>, you must cast
<CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> to a <CODE>double</CODE> value:


<PRE>
double    real_val;
real_val = *((double*) args-&#62;args[i]);
</PRE>

</UL>

<DT><CODE>unsigned long *lengths</CODE>
<DD>
For the initialisation function, the <CODE>lengths</CODE> array indicates the
maximum string length for each argument. You should not change these.
For each invocation of the main function, <CODE>lengths</CODE> contains the
actual lengths of any string arguments that are passed for the row
currently being processed.  For arguments of types <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE> or
<CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>lengths</CODE> still contains the maximum length of
the argument (as for the initialisation function).

The initialisation function should return <CODE>0</CODE> if no error occurred and
<CODE>1</CODE> otherwise.  If an error occurs, <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> should store a
null-terminated error message in the <CODE>message</CODE> parameter.  The message
will be returned to the client.  The message buffer is
<CODE>MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE</CODE> characters long, but you should try to keep the
message to less than 80 characters so that it fits the width of a standard
terminal screen.

</P>
<P>
The return value of the main function <CODE>xxx()</CODE> is the function value, for
<CODE>long long</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> functions.  A string functions should
return a pointer to the result and store the length of the string in the
<CODE>length</CODE> arguments.

</P>
<P>
Set these to the contents and length of the return value.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
memcpy(result, "result string", 13);
*length = 13;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>result</CODE> buffer that is passed to the calc function is 255 byte
big. If your result fits in this, you don't have to worry about memory
allocation for results.

</P>
<P>
If your string function needs to return a string longer than 255 bytes,
you must allocate the space for it with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> in your
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> function or your <CODE>xxx()</CODE> function and free it in
your <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> function.  You can store the allocated memory
in the <CODE>ptr</CODE> slot in the <CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure for reuse by
future <CODE>xxx()</CODE> calls.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_calling">13.2.2.1  UDF Calling Sequences for simple functions</A>.

<P>
To indicate a return value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> in the main function, set
<CODE>is_null</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE>:

<P>
To indicate an error return in the main function, set the <CODE>error</CODE>
parameter to <CODE>1</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
*error = 1;
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>xxx()</CODE> sets <CODE>*error</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE> for any row, the function
value is <CODE>NULL</CODE> for the current row and for any subsequent rows
processed by the statement in which <CODE>XXX()</CODE> was invoked.  (<CODE>xxx()</CODE>
will not even be called for subsequent rows.) <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: in
MySQL versions prior to 3.22.10, you should set both <CODE>*error</CODE>

Files implementing UDFs must be compiled and installed on the host where the
server runs.  This process is described below for the example UDF file
<TT>`udf_example.cc'</TT> that is included in the MySQL source
distribution.  This file contains the following functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>metaphon()</CODE> returns a metaphon string of the string argument.
This is something like a soundex string, but it's more tuned for English.
<LI>

<CODE>myfunc_double()</CODE> returns the sum of the ASCII values of the
characters in its arguments, divided by the sum of the length of its arguments.
<LI>

<CODE>myfunc_int()</CODE> returns the sum of the length of its arguments.
<LI>

<CODE>sequence([const int])</CODE> returns an sequence starting from the given
number or 1 if no number has been given.
<LI>

<CODE>lookup()</CODE> returns the IP number for a hostname.
<LI>

<CODE>reverse_lookup()</CODE> returns the hostname for an IP number.
The function may be called with a string <CODE>"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"</CODE> or
four numbers.
</UL>

<P>
A dynamically loadable file should be compiled as a sharable object file,
using a command something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gcc -shared -o udf_example.so myfunc.cc
</PRE>

<P>
You can easily find out the correct compiler options for your system by
running this command in the <TT>`sql'</TT> directory of your MySQL
source tree:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; make udf_example.o
</PRE>

<P>
You should run a compile command similar to the one that <CODE>make</CODE> displays,
except that you should remove the <CODE>-c</CODE> option near the end of the line
and add <CODE>-o udf_example.so</CODE> to the end of the line.  (On some systems,
you may need to leave  the <CODE>-c</CODE> on the command.)

</P>
<P>
Once you compile a shared object containing UDFs, you must install it and
tell MySQL about it. Compiling a shared object from <TT>`udf_example.cc'</TT>
produces a file named something like <TT>`udf_example.so'</TT> (the exact name
may vary from platform to platform). Copy this file to some directory
searched by the dynamic linker <CODE>ld</CODE>, such as <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT> or add the
directory in which you placed the shared object to the linker configuration
file (for example, <TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT>).

</P>
<P>
On many systems, you can also set the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY</CODE> or
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable to point at the directory where
you have your UDF function files. The <CODE>dlopen</CODE> manual page tells you
which variable you should use on your system. You should set this in
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> or <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> startup scripts and restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After the library is installed, notify <CODE>mysqld</CODE> about the new
functions with these commands:

system table <CODE>func</CODE> in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  The function's name,
type and shared library name are saved in the table.  You must have the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database
to create and drop functions.

</P>
<P>
You should not use <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> to add a function that has already
been created.  If you need to reinstall a function, you should remove it with
<CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> and then reinstall it with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE>.  You
would need to do this, for example, if you recompile a new version of your
function, so that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gets the new version.  Otherwise, the server
will continue to use the old version.

</P>
<P>
Active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless you start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  In this case, UDF
initialisation is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.  (An active function is
one that has been loaded with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and not removed with
<CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE>.)

<A NAME="IDX1992"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1993"></A>

</P>
<P>
The procedure for adding a new native function is described here.  Note
that you cannot add native functions to a binary distribution because
the procedure involves modifying MySQL source code.  You must
compile MySQL yourself from a source distribution.  Also note
that if you migrate to another version of MySQL (for example,
when a new version is released), you will need to repeat the procedure
with the new version.

</P>
<P>
To add a new native MySQL function, follow these steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Add one line to <TT>`lex.h'</TT> that defines the function name in the
<CODE>sql_functions[]</CODE> array.
<LI>

If the function prototype is simple (just takes zero, one, two or three
arguments), you should in lex.h specify SYM(FUNC_ARG#) (where # is the
number of arguments) as the second argument in the
<CODE>sql_functions[]</CODE> array and add a function that creates a function
object in <TT>`item_create.cc'</TT>.  Take a look at <CODE>"ABS"</CODE> and
<CODE>create_funcs_abs()</CODE> for an example of this.

If the function prototype is complicated (for example takes a variable number
of arguments), you should add two lines to <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT>. One
indicates the preprocessor symbol that <CODE>yacc</CODE> should define (this
should be added at the beginning of the file). Then define the function
parameters and add an ``item'' with these parameters to the
<CODE>simple_expr</CODE> parsing rule.  For an example, check all occurrences
of <CODE>ATAN</CODE> in <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT> to see how this is done.
<LI>

In <TT>`item_func.h'</TT>, declare a class inheriting from <CODE>Item_num_func</CODE> or
<CODE>Item_str_func</CODE>, depending on whether your function returns a number or a
string.
<LI>

In <TT>`item_func.cc'</TT>, add one of the following declarations, depending
on whether you are defining a numeric or string function:

<PRE>
double   Item_func_newname::val()
longlong Item_func_newname::val_int()
String  *Item_func_newname::Str(String *str)
</PRE>

If you inherit your object from any of the standard items (like
<CODE>Item_num_func</CODE>), you probably only have to define one of the above
functions and let the parent object take care of the other functions.
For example, the <CODE>Item_str_func</CODE> class defines a <CODE>val()</CODE> function
that executes <CODE>atof()</CODE> on the value returned by <CODE>::str()</CODE>.

<LI>

You should probably also define the following object function:

<PRE>
void Item_func_newname::fix_length_and_dec()
</PRE>

This function should at least calculate <CODE>max_length</CODE> based on the
given arguments. <CODE>max_length</CODE> is the maximum number of characters
the function may return.  This function should also set <CODE>maybe_null
= 0</CODE> if the main function can't return a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  The
function can check if any of the function arguments can return
<CODE>NULL</CODE> by checking the arguments <CODE>maybe_null</CODE> variable. You
can take a look at <CODE>Item_func_mod::fix_length_and_dec</CODE> for a
typical example of how to do this.
</OL>

<P>
All functions must be thread-safe (in other words, don't use any global or
static variables in the functions without protecting them with mutexes).

</P>
<P>
If you want to return <CODE>NULL</CODE>, from <CODE>::val()</CODE>, <CODE>::val_int()</CODE>
or <CODE>::str()</CODE> you should set <CODE>null_value</CODE> to 1 and return 0.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>::str()</CODE> object functions, there are some additional
considerations to be aware of:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>String *str</CODE> argument provides a string buffer that may be
used to hold the result. (For more information about the <CODE>String</CODE> type,
take a look at the <TT>`sql_string.h'</TT> file.)
<LI>

The <CODE>::str()</CODE> function should return the string that holds the result or
<CODE>(char*) 0</CODE> if the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

All current string functions try to avoid allocating any memory unless
absolutely necessary!

This chapter lists some common problems and error messages that users have

<H2><A NAME="What_is_crashing" HREF="manual_toc.html#What_is_crashing">A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems</A></H2>

<P>
When you run into problems, the first thing you should do is to find out
which program / piece of equipment is causing problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you have one of the following symptoms, then it is probably a hardware
(like memory, motherboard, CPU, or hard disk) or kernel problem:

<UL>
<LI>

The keyboard doesn't work.  This can normally be checked by pressing
Caps Lock. If the Caps Lock light doesn't change you have to replace
your keyboard.  (Before doing this, you should try to reboot
your computer and check all cables to the keyboard.)
<LI>

The mouse pointer doesn't move.
<LI>

The machine doesn't answer to a remote machine's pings.
<LI>

Different, unrelated programs don't behave correctly.
<LI>

If your system rebooted unexpectedly (a faulty user level program should
<STRONG>never</STRONG> be able to take down your system).
</UL>

In this case you should start by checking all your cables and run some
diagnostic tool to check your hardware!
You should also check if there are any patches, updates, or service
packs for your operating system that could likely solve your problems.
Check also that all your libraries (like glibc) are up to date.

It's always good to use a machine with ECC memory to discover
memory problems early!
<LI>

If your keyboard is locked up, you may be able to fix this by
logging into your machine from another machine and execute
<CODE>kbd_mode -a</CODE> on it.

<LI>

Please examine your system log file (/var/log/messages or similar) for
reasons for your problems.  If you think the problem is in MySQL
then you should also examine MySQL's log files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.

<LI>

If you don't think you have hardware problems, you should try to find
out which program is causing problems.

Try using <CODE>top</CODE>, <CODE>ps</CODE>, <CODE>taskmanager</CODE>, or some similar program,
to check which program is taking all CPU or is locking the machine.

<LI>

Check with <CODE>top</CODE>, <CODE>df</CODE>, or a similar program if you are out of
memory, disk space, open files, or some other critical resource.

<LI>

If the problem is some runaway process, you can always try to kill it. If it
doesn't want to die, there is probably a bug in the operating system.
</UL>

<P>
If after you have examined all other possibilities and you have
concluded that it's the MySQL server or a MySQL client
that is causing the problem, it's time to do a bug report for our
mailing list or our support team.  In the bug report, try to give a
very detailed description of how the system is behaving and what you think is
happening. You should also state why you think it's MySQL that
is causing the problems.  Take into consideration all the situations in
this chapter. State any problems exactly how they appear when you
examine your system. Use the 'cut and paste' method for any output
and/or error messages from programs and/or log files!

</P>
<P>
Try to describe in detail which program is not working and all
symptoms you see!  We have in the past received many bug reports that just
state "the system doesn't work".  This doesn't provide us with any
information about what could be the problem.

</P>
<P>
If a program fails, it's always useful to know:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Has the program in question made a segmentation fault (core dumped)?
<LI>

Is the program taking up the whole CPU? Check with <CODE>top</CODE>. Let the
program run for a while, it may be evaluating something heavy.
<LI>

If it's the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server that is causing problems, can you
do <CODE>mysqladmin -u root ping</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin -u root processlist</CODE>?
<LI>

What does a client program say (try with <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for example)
when you try to connect to the MySQL server?
Does the client jam?  Do you get any output from the program?
</UL>

<P>
When sending a bug report, you should of follow the outlines
described in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Asking_questions">1.6.1.2  Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Gone_away" HREF="manual_toc.html#Gone_away">A.2.2  <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
This section also covers the related <CODE>Lost connection to server
during query</CODE> error.

</P>
<P>
The most common reason for the <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> error
is that the server timed out and closed the connection. By default, the
server closes the connection after 8 hours if nothing has happened. You
can change the time limit by setting the <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> variable when
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another common reason to receive the <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> error
is because you have issued a ``close'' on your MySQL connection
and then tried to run a query on the closed connection.

</P>
<P>
If you have a script, you just have to issue the query again for the client
to do an automatic reconnection.

</P>
<P>
You normally can get the following error codes in this case
(which one you get is OS-dependent):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Error code</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR</CODE> </TD><TD> The client couldn't send a question to the
server.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CR_SERVER_LOST</CODE> </TD><TD> The client didn't get an error when writing
to the server, but it didn't get a full answer (or any answer) to the question.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You will also get this error if someone has kills the running thread with
<CODE>kill #threadid#</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check that the MySQL hasn't died by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
version</CODE> and examining the uptime.  If the problem is that mysqld
crashed you should concentrate one finding the reason for the crash.
You should in this case start by checking if issuing the query again
will kill MySQL again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also get these errors if you send a query to the server that is
incorrect or too large. If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gets a packet that is too large
or out of order, it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client and
closes the connection.  If you need big queries (for example, if you are
working with big <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns), you can increase the query limit by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>-O max_allowed_packet=#</CODE> option
(default 1M). The extra memory is allocated on demand, so <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
allocate more memory only when you issue a big query or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> must
return a big result row!

</P>
<P>
You will also get a lost connection if you are sending a packet &#62;= 16M
if your client is older than 4.0.8 and your server is 4.0.8 and above, or
the other way around.

</P>
<P>
If you want to make a bug report regarding this problem, be sure that
you include the following information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>hostname.err file</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.
<LI>

If a specific query kills <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and the involved tables where
checked with <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> before you did the query, can you do
a test case for this? See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case If You Experience Table Corruption</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Can_not_connect_to_server" HREF="manual_toc.html#Can_not_connect_to_server">A.2.3  <CODE>Can't connect to [local] MySQL server</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server in two
different ways: Unix sockets, which connect through a file in the file
system (default <TT>`/tmp/mysqld.sock'</TT>) or TCP/IP, which connects
through a port number.  Unix sockets are faster than TCP/IP but can only
be used when connecting to a server on the same computer.  Unix sockets
are used if you don't specify a hostname or if you specify the special
hostname <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Windows, if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is running on 9x/Me, you can
connect only via TCP/IP. If the server is running on NT/2000/XP and
mysqld is started with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>, you
can also connect with named pipes. The name of the named pipe is MySQL.
If you don't give a hostname when connecting to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, a MySQL
client will first try to connect to the named pipe, and if this doesn't
work it will connect to the TCP/IP port.  You can force the use of named
pipes on Windows by using <CODE>.</CODE> as the hostname.

</P>
<P>
The error (2002) <CODE>Can't connect to ...</CODE> normally means that there
isn't a MySQL server running on the system or that you are
using a wrong socket file or TCP/IP port when trying to connect to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
Start by checking (using <CODE>ps</CODE> or the task manager on Windows) that
there is a process running named <CODE>mysqld</CODE> on your server!  If there
isn't any <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process, you should start one. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process is running, you can check the server by
trying these different connections (the port number and socket pathname
might be different in your setup, of course):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin version
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` version variables
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` --port=3306 version
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'ip for your host' version
shell&#62; mysqladmin --protocol=socket --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock version
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of backquotes rather than forward quotes with the <CODE>hostname</CODE>
command; these cause the output of <CODE>hostname</CODE> (that is, the current
hostname) to be substituted into the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
Here are some reasons the <CODE>Can't connect to local MySQL server</CODE>
error might occur:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not running.
<LI>

You are running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads.
If you are running on a system that doesn't have native threads,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses the MIT-pthreads package.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.  However,
not all MIT-pthreads versions support Unix sockets. On a system
without sockets support you must always specify the hostname explicitly
when connecting to the server. Try using this command to check the
connection to the server:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` version
</PRE>

<LI>

Someone has removed the Unix socket that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses (default
<TT>`/tmp/mysqld.sock'</TT>).  You might have a <CODE>cron</CODE> job that removes
the MySQL socket (for example, a job that removes old files
from the <TT>`/tmp'</TT> directory).  You can always run <CODE>mysqladmin
version</CODE> and check that the socket <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> is trying to use
really exists.  The fix in this case is to change the <CODE>cron</CODE> job to
not remove <TT>`mysqld.sock'</TT> or to place the socket somewhere else.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.
<LI>

You have started the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with
the <CODE>--socket=/path/to/socket</CODE> option.  If you change the socket
pathname for the server, you must also notify the MySQL clients
about the new path. You can do this by providing the socket path
as an argument to the client. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.
<LI>

You are using Linux and one thread has died (core dumped).  In this case
you must kill the other <CODE>mysqld</CODE> threads (for example, with the
<CODE>mysql_zap</CODE> script before you can start a new MySQL
server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.
<LI>

You may not have read and write privilege to either the directory that holds
the socket file or privilege to the socket file itself. In this case you
have to either change the privilege for the directory / file or restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> so that it uses a directory that you can access.
</UL>

<P>
If you get the error message <CODE>Can't connect to MySQL server on
some_hostname</CODE>, you can try the following things to find out what the
problem is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Check if the server is up by doing <CODE>telnet your-host-name
tcp-ip-port-number</CODE> and press Enter a couple of times.  If there
is a MySQL server running on this port you should get a
responses that includes the version number of the running MySQL
server.  If you get an error like <CODE>telnet: Unable to connect to
remote host: Connection refused</CODE>, then there is no server running on the
given port.
<LI>

Try connecting to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon on the local machine and check
the TCP/IP port that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> it's configured to use (variable <CODE>port</CODE>) with
<CODE>mysqladmin variables</CODE>.
<LI>

Check that your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is not started with the
<CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Old_client" HREF="manual_toc.html#Old_client">A.2.4  <CODE>Client does not support authentication protocol</CODE> error</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL 4.1 uses an authentication protocal based on a password hashing
algorithm that is incompatible with that used by older clients.
If you upgrade the server to 4.1, attempts to connect to a it with an
older client may fail with the following message:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql
Client does not support authentication protocol requested
by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
</PRE>

<P>
To solve this problem you should do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Upgrade all client programs to use the 4.1.1 or newer client library.
<LI>

Use a user account with an old password when connecting from a pre 4.1 client.
<LI>

Reset the user that needs a pre-4.1 client to use an old password:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password = OLD_PASSWORD('mypass')
    -&#62; WHERE Host = 'some_host' AND User = 'some_user';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

<LI>

Tell the server to use the older password hashing algorithm:

<OL>
<LI>

Start mysqld with <CODE>--old-passwords</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="Blocked_host" HREF="manual_toc.html#Blocked_host">A.2.5  <CODE>Host '...' is blocked</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you get an error like this:

</P>

<PRE>
Host 'hostname' is blocked because of many connection errors.
Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'
</PRE>

<P>
this means that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has gotten a lot (<CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE>)
of connect requests from the host <CODE>'hostname'</CODE> that have been interrupted
in the middle. After <CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> failed requests, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
assumes that something is wrong (like an attack from a cracker), and
blocks the site from further connections until someone executes the command
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-hosts</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> blocks a host after 10 connection errors.
You can easily adjust this by starting the server like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_safe -O max_connect_errors=10000 &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if you get this error message for a given host, you should first
check that there isn't anything wrong with TCP/IP connections from that
host.  If your TCP/IP connections aren't working, it won't do you any good to
increase the value of the <CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> variable!

<P>
If you get the error <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> when you try to connect
to MySQL, this means that there is already <CODE>max_connections</CODE>
clients connected to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
If you need more connections than the default (100), then you should restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a bigger value for the <CODE>max_connections</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> actually allows (<CODE>max_connections</CODE>+1)
clients to connect.  The last connection is reserved for a user with the
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.  By not giving this privilege to normal
users (they shouldn't need this), an administrator with this privilege
can log in and use <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> to find out what could be
wrong. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_PROCESSLIST">4.5.7.6  <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
The maximum number of connects MySQL is depending on how good
the thread library is on a given platform. Linux or Solaris should be
able to support 500-1000 simultaneous connections, depending on how much
RAM you have and what your clients are doing.

<H3><A NAME="Non-transactional_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Non-transactional_tables">A.2.7  <CODE>Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2003"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you get the error/warning: <CODE>Warning: Some non-transactional
changed tables couldn't be rolled back</CODE> when trying to do a
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, this means that some of the tables you used in the
transaction didn't support transactions.  These non-transactional tables
will not be affected by the <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
The most typical case when this happens is when you have tried to create
a table of a type that is not supported by your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary.
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't support a table type (or if the table type is
disabled by a startup option) , it will instead create the table type
with the table type that is most resembles to the one you requested,
probably <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check the table type for a table by doing:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table_name'</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_TABLE_STATUS">4.5.7.2  <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
You can check the extensions your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary supports by doing:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>show variables like 'have_%'</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Out_of_memory" HREF="manual_toc.html#Out_of_memory">A.2.8  <CODE>Out of memory</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you issue a query and get something like the following error:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql: Out of memory at line 42, 'malloc.c'
mysql: needed 8136 byte (8k), memory in use: 12481367 bytes (12189k)
ERROR 2008: MySQL client ran out of memory
</PRE>

<P>
note that the error refers to the MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE>. The
reason for this error is simply that the client does not have enough memory to
store the whole result.

</P>
<P>
To remedy the problem, first check that your query is correct. Is it
reasonable that it should return so many rows?  If so,
you can use <CODE>mysql --quick</CODE>, which uses <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
to retrieve the result set.  This places less of a load on the client (but
more on the server).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Packet_too_large" HREF="manual_toc.html#Packet_too_large">A.2.9  <CODE>Packet too large</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
When a MySQL client or the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server gets a packet bigger
than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes, it issues a <CODE>Packet too large</CODE>
error and closes the connection.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 3.23 the biggest possible packet is 16M (due to limits in the
client/server protocol). In MySQL 4.0.1 and up, this is only limited by
the amount on memory you have on your server (up to a theoretical
maximum of 2G).

</P>
<P>
A communication packet is a single SQL statement sent to the MySQL server
or a single row that is sent to the client.

</P>
<P>
When a MySQL client or the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server gets a packet bigger
than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes, it issues a <CODE>Packet too
large</CODE> error and closes the connection.  With some clients, you may also
get <CODE>Lost connection to MySQL server during query</CODE> error if the
communication packet is too big.

</P>
<P>
Note that both the client and the server has it's own
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> variable. If you want to handle big packets,
you have to increase this variable both in the client and in the server.

</P>
<P>
It's safe to increase this variable as memory is only allocated when
needed; this variable is more a precaution to catch wrong packets
between the client/server and also to ensure that you don't accidentally
use big packets so that you run out of memory.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, you may specify a bigger
buffer by starting the client with
<CODE>mysql --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=8M</CODE>.
Other clients have different methods to set this variable.
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is deprecated since
MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--max-allowed-packet=8M</CODE> instead.
 
You can use the option file to set <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to a larger
size in <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  For example, if you are expecting to store the
full length of a <CODE>MEDIUMBLOB</CODE> into a table, you'll need to start
the server with the <CODE>set-variable=max_allowed_packet=16M</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
You can also get strange problems with large packets if you are using
big blobs, but you haven't given <CODE>mysqld</CODE> access to enough memory
to handle the query.  If you suspect this is the case, try adding
<CODE>ulimit -d 256000</CODE> to the beginning of the <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script
and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

Usage of Ethernet protocol with Linux, both half and full duplex.
Many Linux Ethernet drivers have this bug. You should test for this
bug by transferring a huge file via ftp between these two machines.
If a transfer goes in burst-pause-burst-pause ... mode then you are
experiencing a Linux duplex syndrome.
The only solution is switching duplex mode for both your network card
and Hub/Switch to either full duplex or to half duplex and testing the
results to decide on the best setting.
<LI>

Some problem with the thread library that causes interrupts on reads.
<LI>

Badly configured TCP/IP.
<LI>

Faulty Ethernets or hubs or switches, cables ... This can be diagnosed
properly only by replacing hardware.
<LI>

<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is too small or queries require more memory

<H3><A NAME="Full_table" HREF="manual_toc.html#Full_table">A.2.11  <CODE>The table is full</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2007"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are a couple of different cases when you can get this error:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are using an older MySQL version (before 3.23.0) when an in-memory
temporary table becomes larger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> bytes.
To avoid this problem, you can use the <CODE>-O tmp_table_size=#</CODE> option
to make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> increase the temporary table size or use the SQL
option <CODE>BIG_TABLES</CODE> before you issue the problematic query.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--big-tables</CODE> option.
This is exactly the same as using <CODE>BIG_TABLES</CODE> for all queries.

In MySQL Version 3.23, in-memory temporary tables will automatically be
converted to a disk-based <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table after the table size gets
bigger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>.
<LI>

You are using <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables and run out of room in the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tablespace. In this case the solution is to extend the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tablespace.
<LI>

You are using <CODE>ISAM</CODE> or <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables on an OS that only
supports files of 2G in size and you have hit this limit for the datafile
or index file.
<LI>

You are using <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables and the needed data or index size is
bigger than what MySQL has allocated pointers for.  (If you don't specify
<CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> to <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> MySQL will only allocate pointers
to hold 4G of data).

You can check the maximum data/index sizes by doing

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM database LIKE 'table_name';
</PRE>

or using <CODE>myisamchk -dv database/table_name</CODE>.

If this is the problem, you can fix it by doing something like:

<PRE>
ALTER TABLE table_name MAX_ROWS=1000000000 AVG_ROW_LENGTH=nnn;
</PRE>

You only have to specify <CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> for tables with
<CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE>
fields as in this case MySQL can't optimise the space required based
only on the number of rows.

<P>
If you get an error for some queries of type:

</P>

<PRE>
Can't create/write to file '\\sqla3fe_0.ism'.
</PRE>

<P>
this means that MySQL can't create a temporary file for the
result set in the given temporary directory. (The above error is a
typical error message on Windows, and the Unix error message is similar.)
The fix is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--tmpdir=path</CODE> or to add to your

If you get the following error:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>Found wrong password for user: 'some_user@some_host'; ignoring user</CODE>

</P>
<P>
this means that when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was started or when it reloaded the

an invalid password.  As a result, the entry is simply ignored by the

</P>
<P>
Possible causes of and fixes for this problem:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You may be running a new version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with an old
<CODE>user</CODE> table.
You can check this by executing <CODE>mysqlshow mysql user</CODE> to see if
the password field is shorter than 16 characters. If so, you can correct this
condition by running the <CODE>scripts/add_long_password</CODE> script.

<LI>

The user has an old password (8 characters long) and you didn't start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option.
Update the user in the <CODE>user</CODE> table with a new password or
restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX2010"></A>
You have specified a password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table without using the

<P>
This means one of the following things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The character set is a multi-byte character set and you have no support
for the character set in the client.

In this case you need to recompile the client with
<CODE>--with-charset=xxx</CODE> or with <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=xxx</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
<CODE>--with-extra-character-sets=complex</CODE> which will enable support for
all multi-byte character sets. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<LI>

The character set is a simple character set which is not compiled into
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> and the character set definition files are not in the place
where the client expects to find them.

In this case you need to:


<UL>
<LI>

Recompile the client with support for the character set.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.
<LI>

Specify to the client where the character set definition files are. For many
clients you can do this with the
<CODE>--character-sets-dir=path-to-charset-dir</CODE> option.

File table overflow
shell&#62; perror 24
Too many open files
shell&#62; perror 11
Resource temporarily unavailable
</PRE>

<P>
The problem here is that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to keep open too many
files simultaneously.  You can either tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> not to open so
many files at once or increase the number of file descriptors
available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to keep open fewer files at a time, you can make
the table cache smaller by using the <CODE>-O table_cache=32</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> (the default value is 64). Reducing the value of
<CODE>max_connections</CODE> will also reduce the number of open files (the
default value is 90).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2012"></A>
To change the number of file descriptors available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you
can use the option <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> or
<CODE>-O open-files-limit=#</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
The easiest way to do that is to add the option to your option file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  If you have an old <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version that
doesn't support this, you can edit the <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> script.  There
is a commented-out line <CODE>ulimit -n 256</CODE> in the script.  You can
remove the <CODE>'#'</CODE> character to uncomment this line, and change the
number 256 to affect the number of file descriptors available to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ulimit</CODE> (and <CODE>open-files-limit</CODE>) can increase the number of
file descriptors, but only up to the limit imposed by the operating
system. There is also a 'hard' limit that can only be overridden if you
start <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> or <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root (just remember that
you need to also use the <CODE>--user=...</CODE> option in this case).  If you
need to increase the OS limit on the number of file descriptors
available to each process, consult the documentation for your operating
system.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you run the <CODE>tcsh</CODE> shell, <CODE>ulimit</CODE> will not work!
<CODE>tcsh</CODE> will also report incorrect values when you ask for the current

<P>
Another way to solve this problem is to link your program statically, with

The MySQL server <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be started and run by any user.
In order to change <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as a Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE>, you must
do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Stop the server if it's running (use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>).

<LI>

Change the database directories and files so that <CODE>user_name</CODE> has
privileges to read and write files in them (you may need to do this as
the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user):


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R user_name /path/to/mysql/datadir
</PRE>

If directories or files within the MySQL data directory are
symlinks, you'll also need to follow those links and change the directories
and files they point to.  <CODE>chown -R</CODE> may not follow symlinks for
you.

<LI>

Start the server as user <CODE>user_name</CODE>, or, if you are using
MySQL Version 3.22 or later, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE>
user and use the <CODE>--user=user_name</CODE> option.  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will switch
to run as the Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE> before accepting any connections.

<LI>

To start the server as the given user name automatically at system
startup time, add a <CODE>user</CODE> line that specifies the user name to
the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> option file or the
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option file in the server's data directory. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]

</OL>

<P>
At this point, your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process should be running fine and dandy as
the Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE>. One thing hasn't changed, though: the
contents of the permissions tables. By default (right after running the
permissions table install script <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>), the MySQL
user <CODE>root</CODE> is the only user with permission to access the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database or to create or drop databases.  Unless you have changed those
permissions, they still hold. This shouldn't stop you from accessing
MySQL as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user when you're logged in
as a Unix user other than <CODE>root</CODE>; just specify the <CODE>-u root</CODE> option
to the client program.

</P>
<P>
Note that accessing MySQL as <CODE>root</CODE>, by supplying <CODE>-u
root</CODE> on the command-line, has <STRONG>nothing</STRONG> to do with MySQL running
as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user, or, indeed, as another Unix user. The access
permissions and user names of MySQL are completely separate from
Unix user names. The only connection with Unix user names is that if you
don't provide a <CODE>-u</CODE> option when you invoke a client program, the client
will try to connect using your Unix login name as your MySQL user
name.

</P>
<P>
If your Unix box itself isn't secured, you should probably at least put a
password on the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> users in the access tables.
Otherwise, any user with an account on that machine can run <CODE>mysql -u
root db_name</CODE> and do whatever he likes.

If you have problems with file permissions, for example, if <CODE>mysql</CODE>
issues the following error message when you create a table:

</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2021"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2022"></A>
then the environment variable <CODE>UMASK</CODE> might be set incorrectly when
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up.  The default umask value is <CODE>0660</CODE>. You can
change this behaviour by starting <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; UMASK=384  # = 600 in octal
shell&#62; export UMASK
shell&#62; /path/to/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2023"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2024"></A>
By default MySQL will create database and <CODE>RAID</CODE>
directories with permission type 0700.  You can modify this behaviour by
setting the <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> variable. If you set this, new
directories are created with the combined <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and
<CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE>. For example, if you want to give group access to
all new directories, you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; UMASK_DIR=504  # = 770 in octal
shell&#62; export UMASK_DIR
shell&#62; /path/to/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.25 and above, MySQL assumes that the
value for <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> is in octal if it starts
with a zero.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2025"></A>

</P>
<P>
All MySQL versions are tested on many platforms before they are
released.  This doesn't mean that there aren't any bugs in
MySQL, but it means if there are bugs, they are very few and can be
hard to find.  If you have a problem, it will always help if you try to
find out exactly what crashes your system, as you will have a much better
chance of getting this fixed quickly.

</P>
<P>
First, you should try to find out whether the problem is that the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon dies or whether your problem has to do with your
client.  You can check how long your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server has been up by
executing <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE>.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has died, you may
find the reason for this in the file
<TT>`mysql-data-directory/`hostname`.err'</TT>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
On some systems you can find in this file a stack trace of where <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
died that you can resolve with <CODE>resolve_back_stack</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_stack_trace">E.1.4  Using a Stack Trace</A>. Note that the variable values written in the <CODE>.err</CODE>
file may not always be 100 percent correct.

</P>
<P>
Many crashes of MySQL are caused by corrupted index files or datafiles.
MySQL will update the data on disk, with the
<CODE>write()</CODE> system call, after every SQL statement and before the
client is notified about the result. (This is not true if you are running
with <CODE>delay_key_write</CODE>, in which case only the data is written.)
This means that the data is safe even if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes, as the OS will
ensure that the not flushed data is written to disk.  You can force
MySQL to sync everything to disk after every SQL command by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--flush</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The above means that normally you shouldn't get corrupted tables unless:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Someone/something killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE> or the machine in the middle
of an update.
<LI>

You have found a bug in <CODE>mysqld</CODE> that caused it to die in the
middle of an update.
<LI>

Someone is manipulating the data/index files outside of <STRONG>mysqld</STRONG>
without locking the table properly.
<LI>

If you are running many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on the same data on a
system that doesn't support good filesystem locks (normally handled by
the <CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon ) or if you are running
multiple servers with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>
<LI>

You have a crashed index/datafile that contains very wrong data that
got <CODE>mysqld</CODE> confused.
<LI>

You have found a bug in the data storage code. This isn't that likely,
but it's at least possible.  In this case you can try to change the file
type to another storage engine by using <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a
repaired copy of the table!
</UL>

<P>
Because it is very difficult to know why something is crashing, first try to
check whether things that work for others crash for you.  Please try
the following things:

</P>

<UL>
Take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>, run
<CODE>myisamchk --silent --force */*.MYI</CODE> on all tables, and restart the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon.  This will ensure that you are running from a clean
state.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqld --log</CODE> and try to determine from the information in the log
whether some specific query kills the server. About 95% of all bugs are
related to a particular query!  Normally this is one of the last queries in
the log file just before MySQL restarted. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.
If you can repeatedly kill MySQL with one of the queries, even
when you have checked all tables just before doing the query, then you
have been able to locate the bug and should do a bug report for this!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

<LI>

Try to make a test case that we can use to reproduce the problem.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case If You Experience Table Corruption</A>.

<LI>

Try running the included mysql-test test and the MySQL
benchmarks.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_test_suite">13.1.2  MySQL Test Suite</A>.  They should test MySQL
rather well.  You can also add code to the benchmarks that simulates
your application!  The benchmarks can be found in the <TT>`bench'</TT>
directory in the source distribution or, for a binary distribution, in
the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

<LI>

Try <CODE>fork_test.pl</CODE> and <CODE>fork2_test.pl</CODE>.

<LI>

If you configure MySQL for debugging, it will be much easier to
gather information about possible errors if something goes wrong.
Reconfigure MySQL with the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> option or
<CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> to <CODE>configure</CODE> and then recompile.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<LI>

Configuring MySQL for debugging causes a safe memory allocator to be
included that can find some errors. It also provides a lot of output about
what is happening.

<LI>

Have you applied the latest patches for your operating system?

<LI>

Use the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  On some
systems, the <CODE>lockd</CODE> lock manager does not work properly; the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option tells <CODE>mysqld</CODE> not to use external
locking.  (This means that you cannot run 2 <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on the same
data and that you must be careful if you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, but it may be
instructive to try the option as a test.)

<LI>

Have you tried <CODE>mysqladmin -u root processlist</CODE> when <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
appears to be running but not responding?  Sometimes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not
comatose even though you might think so.  The problem may be that all
connections are in use, or there may be some internal lock problem.
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> will usually be able to make a connection even
in these cases, and can provide useful information about the current number
of connections and their status.

<LI>

Run the command <CODE>mysqladmin -i 5 status</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin -i 5
-r status</CODE> or in a separate window to produce statistics while you run
your other queries.

<LI>

Try the following:

<OL>
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from <CODE>gdb</CODE> (or in another debugger).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">E.1.3  Debugging mysqld under gdb</A>.

<LI>

Run your test scripts.

<LI>

Print the backtrace and the local variables at the 3 lowest levels. In gdb you
can do this with the following commands when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has crashed inside
gdb:


<PRE>
backtrace
info local
up
info local
up
info local
</PRE>

With gdb you can also examine which threads exist with <CODE>info
threads</CODE> and switch to a specific thread with <CODE>thread #</CODE>, where
<CODE>#</CODE> is the thread ID.
</OL>

<LI>

Try to simulate your application with a Perl script to force
MySQL to crash or misbehave.

<LI>

Send a normal bug report. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>. Be even more detailed
than usual.  Because MySQL works for many people, it may be that the
crash results from something that exists only on your computer (for example,
an error that is related to your particular system libraries).
<LI>

If you have a problem with tables with dynamic-length rows and you are
not using <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE> columns (but only <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns), you
can try to change all <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> to <CODE>CHAR</CODE> with <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>.  This will force MySQL to use fixed-size rows.
Fixed-size rows take a little extra space, but are much more tolerant to
corruption!

The current dynamic row code has been in use at MySQL AB for at
least 3 years without any problems, but by nature dynamic-length rows are
more prone to errors, so it may be a good idea to try the above to see if
it helps!

</P>
<P>
When a disk-full condition occurs, MySQL does the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

It checks once every minute to see whether there is enough space to
write the current row. If there is enough space, it continues as if nothing had
happened.
<LI>

Every 6 minutes it writes an entry to the log file warning about the disk
full condition.
</UL>

<P>
To alleviate the problem, you can take the following actions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To continue, you only have to free enough disk space to insert all records.
<LI>

To abort the thread, you must send a <CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> to the thread.
The thread will be aborted the next time it checks the disk (in 1 minute).
<LI>

Note that other threads may be waiting for the table that caused the disk
full condition.  If you have several ``locked'' threads, killing the one
thread that is waiting on the disk-full condition will allow the other
threads to continue.
</UL>

<P>
Exceptions to the above behaveour is when you use <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or
<CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> or when the indexes are created in a batch after an
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> or after an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
All of the above commands may use big temporary files that left to
themself would cause big problems for the rest of the system.  If
MySQL gets disk full while doing any of the above operations,
it will remove the big temporary files and mark the table as crashed
(except for <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, in which the old table will be left
unchanged).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Temporary_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL uses the value of the <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> environment variable as
the pathname of the directory in which to store temporary files.  If you don't
have <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> set, MySQL uses the system default, which is
normally <TT>`/tmp'</TT> or <TT>`/usr/tmp'</TT>.  If the filesystem containing your
temporary file directory is too small, you should edit <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> to
set <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> to point to a directory in a filesystem where you have
enough space!  You can also set the temporary directory using the
<CODE>--tmpdir</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL creates all temporary files as hidden files. This ensures
that the temporary files will be removed if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is terminated.  The
disadvantage of using hidden files is that you will not see a big temporary
file that fills up the filesystem in which the temporary file directory is
located.

</P>
<P>
When sorting (<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>), MySQL normally
uses one or two temporary files. The maximum disk-space needed is:

</P>

<PRE>
(length of what is sorted + sizeof(database pointer))
* number of matched rows
* 2
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sizeof(database pointer)</CODE> is usually 4, but may grow in the future for
really big tables.

</P>
<P>
For some <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries, MySQL also creates temporary SQL
tables. These are not hidden and have names of the form <TT>`SQL_*'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> creates a temporary table in the same directory as
the original table.

</P>
<P>
If you use MySQL 4.1 or later you can spread load between
several physical disks by setting <CODE>--tmpdir</CODE> to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> These paths should end up on different <STRONG>physical</STRONG> disks,
not different partitions of the same disk.

</P>
<P>
It is possible to set <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to point to a memory-based filesystem,
except if the MySQL server is a slave. If it is a slave, it needs some
of its temporary files (for replication of temporary tables or of
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>) to survive a machine's reboot, so a
memory-based <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> which is cleared when the machine reboots is not
suitable; a disk-based <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> is necessary.

<P>
By default, MySQL searches are case-insensitive (although there are
some character sets that are never case-insensitive, such as <CODE>czech</CODE>).
That means that if you search with <CODE>col_name LIKE 'a%'</CODE>, you will get all
column values that start with <CODE>A</CODE> or <CODE>a</CODE>. If you want to make this
search case-sensitive, use something like <CODE>INSTR(col_name, "A")=1</CODE> to
check a prefix. Or use <CODE>STRCMP(col_name, "A") = 0</CODE> if the column value
must be exactly <CODE>"A"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Simple comparison operations (<CODE>&#62;=, &#62;, = , &#60; , &#60;=</CODE>, sorting and
grouping) are based on each character's ``sort value''. Characters with
the same sort value (like E, e and ) are treated as the same character!

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions <CODE>LIKE</CODE> comparisons were done on
the uppercase value of each character (E == e but E &#60;&#62; ).  In newer
MySQL versions <CODE>LIKE</CODE> works just like the other comparison
operators.

</P>
<P>
If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive fashion,
declare it as <CODE>BINARY</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using Chinese data in the so-called big5 encoding, you want to

order of big5 encoding characters is based on the order of ASCII codes.

The format of a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value is <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE>. According to
standard SQL, no other format is allowed. You should use this format in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
expressions and in the WHERE clause of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE date &#62;= '1997-05-05';
</PRE>

<P>
As a convenience, MySQL automatically converts a date to a number if
the date is used in a numeric context (and vice versa). It is also smart
enough to allow a ``relaxed'' string form when updating and in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause that compares a date to a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or a
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column.  (Relaxed form means that any punctuation character
may be used as the separator between parts. For example, <CODE>'1998-08-15'</CODE>
and <CODE>'1998#08#15'</CODE> are equivalent.) MySQL can also convert a
string containing no separators (such as <CODE>'19980815'</CODE>), provided it
makes sense as a date.

</P>
<P>
The special date <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> can be stored and retrieved as
<CODE>'0000-00-00'.</CODE> When using a <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> date through
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE>, it will automatically be converted to <CODE>NULL</CODE> in
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> Version 2.50.12 and above, because ODBC can't handle this kind of
date.

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL performs the conversions described above, the following
statements work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES (19970505);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('19970505');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('97-05-05');

mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997 05 05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('0000-00-00');

mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= '1997-05-05';
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= 19970505;
mysql&#62; SELECT MOD(idate,100) FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= 19970505;
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= '19970505';
</PRE>

<P>
However, the following will not work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE STRCMP(idate,'19970505')=0;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>STRCMP()</CODE> is a string function, so it converts <CODE>idate</CODE> to
a string and performs a string comparison.  It does not convert
<CODE>'19970505'</CODE> to a date and perform a date comparison.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL does very limited checking whether the date is
correct.  If you store an incorrect date, such as <CODE>'1998-2-31'</CODE>, the
wrong date will be stored.

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL packs dates for storage, it can't store any given date as
it would not fit onto the result buffer. The rules for accepting a date
are:

<UL>
<LI>

If MySQL can store and retrieve a given date, the wrong date is accepted
for <CODE>DATE</CODE> and <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns.
<LI>

All days values between 0-31 are accepted for any date.  This makes it
very convenient for web applications where you ask year, month and day
in 3 different fields.
<LI>

The day or month field may be zero.  This is convenient if you want
to store a birthdate in a <CODE>DATE</CODE> column and you only know part
of the date.
</UL>

<P>
If the date cannot be converted to any reasonable value, a <CODE>0</CODE> is
stored in the <CODE>DATE</CODE> field, which will be retrieved as
<CODE>0000-00-00</CODE>.  This is both a speed and convenience issue as we
believe that the database's responsibility is to retrieve the same date
you stored (even if the data was not logically correct in all cases).
We think it is up to the application to check the dates, and not the server.

</P>
<P>
The concept of the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is a common source of confusion for
newcomers to SQL, who often think that <CODE>NULL</CODE> is the same thing as an
empty string <CODE>""</CODE>.  This is not the case! For example, the following
statements are completely different:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES (NULL);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES ("");
</PRE>

<P>
Both statements insert a value into the <CODE>phone</CODE> column, but the first
inserts a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value and the second inserts an empty string.  The
meaning of the first can be regarded as ``phone number is not known'' and the
meaning of the second can be regarded as ``she has no phone''.

</P>
<P>
In SQL, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is always false in comparison to any
other value, even <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  An expression that contains <CODE>NULL</CODE>
always produces a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value unless otherwise indicated in
the documentation for the operators and functions involved in the
expression. All columns in the following example return <CODE>NULL</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT NULL,1+NULL,CONCAT('Invisible',NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to search for column values that are <CODE>NULL</CODE>, you
cannot use the <CODE>=NULL</CODE> test. The following statement returns no
rows, because <CODE>expr = NULL</CODE> is FALSE, for any expression:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
To look for <CODE>NULL</CODE> values, you must use the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> test.
The following shows how to find the <CODE>NULL</CODE> phone number and the
empty phone number:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone IS NULL;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = "";
</PRE>

<P>
Note that you can add an index on a column that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values only if you are using MySQL Version 3.23.2 or newer and are using the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, or <CODE>BDB</CODE> table type.
In earlier versions and with other table types, you must declare such
columns <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>. This also means you cannot then insert
<CODE>NULL</CODE> into an indexed column.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2047"></A>
When reading data with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, empty columns are updated
with <CODE>''</CODE>. If you want a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value in a column, you should use
<CODE>\N</CODE> in the text file. The literal word <CODE>'NULL'</CODE> may also be used
under some circumstances.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented first, or
last if you specify <CODE>DESC</CODE> to sort in descending order. Exception:
In MySQL versions 4.0.2 through 4.0.10, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort first
regardless of sort order.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, all <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are regarded as equal.

</P>
<P>
Aggregate (summary) functions such as <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>, and
<CODE>SUM()</CODE> ignore <CODE>NULL</CODE> values. The exception to this is
<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE>, which counts rows and not individual column values.
For example, the following statement would produce two counts.
The first is a count of the number of rows in the table, and the second
is a count of the number of non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values in the <CODE>age</CODE>
column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(age) FROM person;
</PRE>

<P>
To help with <CODE>NULL</CODE> handling, you can use the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and
<CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> operators and the <CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> function.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2048"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2049"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2050"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2051"></A>
For some column types, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are handled specially.  If you
insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column of a table, the
current date and time is inserted.  If you insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the next number in the sequence is inserted.

<H3><A NAME="Problems_with_alias" HREF="manual_toc.html#Problems_with_alias">A.5.4  Problems with <CODE>alias</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2052"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can use an alias to refer to a column in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>,
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, or in the <CODE>HAVING</CODE> part.  Aliases can also be used
to give columns better names:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT SQRT(a*b) as rt FROM table_name GROUP BY rt HAVING rt &#62; 0;
SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name GROUP BY id HAVING cnt &#62; 0;
SELECT id AS "Customer identity" FROM table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that standard SQL doesn't allow you to refer to an alias in a
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  This is because when the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> code is
executed the column value may not yet be determined. For example, the
following query is <STRONG>illegal</STRONG>:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name WHERE cnt &#62; 0 GROUP BY id;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement is executed to determine which rows should
be included in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part while <CODE>HAVING</CODE> is used to
decide which rows from the result set should be used.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Deleting_from_related_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Deleting_from_related_tables">A.5.5  Deleting Rows from Related Tables</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX2053"></A>

</P>
<P>
As MySQL doesn't support subqueries (prior to Version 4.1), nor the use of more
than one table in the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement (prior to Version 4.0), you
should use the following approach to delete rows from 2 related tables:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> the rows based on some <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition in the main table.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE> the rows in the main table based on the same condition.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM related_table WHERE related_column IN (selected_rows)</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
If the total number of characters in the query with
<CODE>related_column</CODE> is more than 1,048,576 (the default value of
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>, you should split it into smaller parts and
execute multiple <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements.  You will probably get the
fastest <CODE>DELETE</CODE> by only deleting 100-1000 <CODE>related_column</CODE>
ids per query if the <CODE>related_column</CODE> is an index.  If the
<CODE>related_column</CODE> isn't an index, the speed is independent of the
number of arguments in the <CODE>IN</CODE> clause.

<P>
If you have a complicated query that has many tables and that doesn't
return any rows, you should use the following procedure to find out what
is wrong with your query:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Test the query with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> and check if you can find something that is
obviously wrong. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

<LI>

Select only those fields that are used in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Remove one table at a time from the query until it returns some rows.
If the tables are big, it's a good idea to use <CODE>LIMIT 10</CODE> with the query.

<LI>

Do a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> for the column that should have matched a row against
the table that was last removed from the query.

<LI>

If you are comparing <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> columns with numbers that
have decimals, you can't use <CODE>'='</CODE>. This problem is common in most
computer languages because floating-point values are not exact values.
In most cases, changing the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> to a <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> will fix this.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_float">A.5.7  Problems with Floating-Point Comparison</A>.

<LI>

If you still can't figure out what's wrong, create a minimal test that can
be run with <CODE>mysql test &#60; query.sql</CODE> that shows your problems.
You can create a test file with <CODE>mysqldump --quick database tables &#62; query.sql</CODE>. Open the file in an editor, remove some insert lines (if there are
too many of these), and add your select statement at the end of the file.

Test that you still have your problem by doing:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create test2
shell&#62; mysql test2 &#60; query.sql
</PRE>

Post the test file using <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> to the general MySQL mailing list.

floating-point numbers cause confusion sometimes, because these numbers

CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, d1 DECIMAL(9,2), d2 DECIMAL(9,2));

<P>
The result is correct. Although the first five records look like they
shouldn't pass the comparison test, they may do so because the
difference between the numbers show up around tenth decimal, or so
depending on computer architecture.

</P>
<P>
The problem cannot be solved by using ROUND() (or similar function),
because the result is still a floating-point number. Example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2) AS a, ROUND(SUM(d2), 2) AS b
    -&#62; FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a &#60;&#62; b;

This is what the numbers in column 'a' look like:

mysql&#62; SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2)*1.0000000000000000 AS a,

<P>
Depending on the computer architecture you may or may not see similar results.
Each CPU may evaluate floating-point numbers differently. For example in
some machines you may get 'right' results by multiplying both arguments
with 1, an example follows.

<P>
<STRONG>WARNING: NEVER TRUST THIS METHOD IN YOUR APPLICATION, THIS IS
AN EXAMPLE OF A WRONG METHOD!!!</STRONG>

+------+--------+------+
| i    | a      | b    |
+------+--------+------+
|    6 | -51.40 | 0.00 |
+------+--------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The reason why the above example seems to be working is that on the
particular machine where the test was done, the CPU floating-point
arithmetics happens to round the numbers to same, but there is no
rule that any CPU should do so, so it cannot be trusted.

</P>
<P>
The correct way to do floating-point number comparison is to first
decide on what is the wanted tolerance between the numbers and then do
the comparison against the tolerance number. For example, if we agree on
that floating-point numbers should be regarded the same, if they are
same with precision of one of ten thousand (0.0001), the comparison
should be done like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -&#62; GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) &#62; 0.0001;
+------+--------+------+
| i    | a      | b    |
+------+--------+------+
|    6 | -51.40 | 0.00 |
+------+--------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
And vice versa, if we wanted to get rows where the numbers are the same,
the test would be:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -&#62; GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) &#60; 0.0001;
+------+-------+-------+
| i    | a     | b     |

MySQL uses a cost based optimiser to find out the best way to resolve a
query.  In many cases MySQL can calculate the best possible query plan
but in some cases MySQL doesn't have enough information about the data
at hand and have to do some 'educated' guesses about the data.

This manual section is intended for the cases when MySQL doesn't get it
right.

<CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> will show <CODE>ALL</CODE> in the <CODE>type</CODE> column when MySQL
uses a table scan to resolve a query. This happens usually when:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The table is so small that it's faster to do a table scan than a key lookup.
This is a common case for tables with &#60; 10 rows and a short row length.
<LI>

There is no usable restrictions in the <CODE>ON</CODE> or <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause
for indexed columns.
<LI>

You are comparing indexed columns with constants and MySQL has
calculated (based on the index tree) that the constants covers a too big
part of the table and a table scan would be faster. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Where_optimisations">5.2.4  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A>.
<LI>

You are using a key with low cardinality (= many matching rows) through
another column.  MySQL will in this case assume that by using the key it
will probably do a lot of key lookups and in this case the table scan
would be faster.
</UL>

<P>
What you can do to avoid a 'wrong' table scan for big tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> for the scanned table to update key distributions.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>FORCE INDEX</CODE> for the scanned table to tell MySQL that table
scans are very expensive compared to use one of the given index. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1,t2 force index(index_for_column) WHERE t1.column=t2.column;
</PRE>

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--max-seeks-for-key=1000</CODE> or do <CODE>SET
MAX_SEEKS_FOR_KEY=1000</CODE>  to tell the optimiser that for no key scan will
cause more than 1000 key seeks.

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> changes a table to the current character set.
If you get a duplicate key error during <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, then the cause
is either that the new character sets maps two keys to the same value
or that the table is corrupted, in which case you should run
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> on the table.

If <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> dies with an error like this:

</P>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
the problem may be that MySQL has crashed in a previous <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> and there is an old table named <TT>`A-something'</TT> or
<TT>`B-something'</TT> lying around.  In this case, go to the MySQL data
directory and delete all files that have names starting with <CODE>A-</CODE> or
<CODE>B-</CODE>.  (You may want to move them elsewhere instead of deleting them.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works the following way:

<UL>
<LI>Create a new table named <TT>`A-xxx'</TT> with the requested changes.

<LI>All rows from the old table are copied to <TT>`A-xxx'</TT>.

<LI>The old table is renamed <TT>`B-xxx'</TT>.

<LI><TT>`A-xxx'</TT> is renamed to your old table name.

<LI><TT>`B-xxx'</TT> is deleted.

</UL>

<P>
If something goes wrong with the renaming operation, MySQL tries to
undo the changes.  If something goes seriously wrong (this shouldn't happen,
of course), MySQL may leave the old table as <TT>`B-xxx'</TT>, but a
simple rename on the system level should get your data back.

<OL>
<LI>

Create a new table with the columns in the right order.
<LI>

Execute
<CODE>INSERT INTO new_table SELECT fields-in-new_table-order FROM old_table</CODE>.
<LI>

Drop or rename <CODE>old_table</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME old_table</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
In an application, you should <STRONG>never</STRONG> use <CODE>SELECT *</CODE> and
retrieve the columns based on their position, because the order and
position in which columns are returned will not remain
the same if you add, move, or delete columns. A simple change to your
database structure would then cause your application to fail.
Of course <CODE>SELECT *</CODE> is quite suitable for testing queries.

The following are a list of the limitations with <CODE>TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A temporary table can only be of type <CODE>HEAP</CODE>, <CODE>ISAM</CODE>,
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, <CODE>MERGE</CODE>, or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<LI>

You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query.
For example, the following doesn't work.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM temporary_table, temporary_table AS t2;
</PRE>

<LI>

You can't use <CODE>RENAME</CODE> on a <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table.
Note that <CODE>ALTER TABLE org_name RENAME new_name</CODE> works!

While <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> owns all copyrights in the <CODE>MySQL server</CODE>

Contributors are listed here, in somewhat random order:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Paul DuBois
<DD>
Ongoing help with making this manual correct and understandable.
That includes rewriting Monty's and David's attempts at English into
English as other people know it.
<DT>Gianmassimo Vigazzola <a HREF="mailto:qwerg@mbox.vol.it">qwerg@mbox.vol.it</a> or <a HREF="mailto:qwerg@tin.it">qwerg@tin.it</a>

The initial port to Win32/NT.
<DT>Kim Aldale
<DD>
Helped to rewrite Monty's and David's early attempts at English into
English.
<DT>Per Eric Olsson
<DD>
For more or less constructive criticism and real testing of the dynamic
record format.
<DT>Irena Pancirov <a HREF="mailto:irena@mail.yacc.it">irena@mail.yacc.it</a>
<DD>
Win32 port with Borland compiler.  <CODE>mysqlshutdown.exe</CODE> and
<CODE>mysqlwatch.exe</CODE>
<DT>David J. Hughes
<DD>
For the effort to make a shareware SQL database. At TcX, the predecessor
of MySQL AB, we started with <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, but found that it couldn't
satisfy our purposes so instead we wrote an SQL interface to our
application builder Unireg.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> and <CODE>mysql</CODE> client are
programs that were largely influenced by their <CODE>mSQL</CODE> counterparts.
We have put a lot of effort into making the MySQL syntax a superset of
<CODE>mSQL</CODE>. Many of the API's ideas are borrowed from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to
make it easy to port free <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs to the MySQL API.
The MySQL software doesn't contain any code from <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.
Two files in the distribution (<TT>`client/insert_test.c'</TT> and
<TT>`client/select_test.c'</TT>) are based on the corresponding (non-copyrighted)
files in the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> distribution, but are modified as examples showing
the changes necessary to convert code from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to MySQL Server.
(<CODE>mSQL</CODE> is copyrighted David J. Hughes.)
<DT>Fred Fish
<DD>
For his excellent C debugging and trace library. Monty has made a number
of smaller improvements to the library (speed and additional options).
<DT>Richard A. O'Keefe
<DD>
For his public domain string library.
<DT>Henry Spencer

For his regex library, used in <CODE>WHERE column REGEXP regexp</CODE>.
<DT>Free Software Foundation

From whom we got an excellent compiler (<CODE>gcc</CODE>), the <CODE>libc</CODE> library
(from which we have borrowed <TT>`strto.c'</TT> to get some code working in Linux),
and the <CODE>readline</CODE> library (for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client).

Note that we tend to update the manual at the same time we make changes to
MySQL.  If you find a version listed here that you can't
find on the MySQL download page (<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>),
this means that the version has not yet been released!

</P>
<P>
The date mentioned with a release version is the date of the last BitKeeper
ChangeSet that this particular release has been based on, not the date when
the packages have been made available. The binaries are usually made
available a few days after the date of the tagged ChangeSet - building and
testing all packages takes some time.

<H2><A NAME="News-5.0.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-5.0.x">D.1  Changes in release 5.0.0 (Development)</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2081"></A>

</P>
<P>
For the time being, version 5.0 is only available in source code.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source_tree">2.3.4  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following changelog shows what has already been done in the 5.0 tree:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Basic support for stored procedures (SQL-99 style).
<LI>

Added <CODE>SELECT INTO list_of_vars</CODE>, which can be of mixed,
that is, global and local type.
<LI>

Deprecated the update log (no longer supported). It is fully
replaced by the binary log.
<LI>

User variable names are now case insensitive: if you do <CODE>SET
@a=10;</CODE> then <CODE>SELECT @A;</CODE> will now return <CODE>10</CODE>. Of course,
the content of the variable is still case sensitive; only the name of
this variable is case insensitive.

<H3><A NAME="News-4.1.1" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.1.1">D.2.1  Changes in release 4.1.1 (to be released soon)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

Added new aggregate function <CODE>BIT_XOR()</CODE> for bitwise XOR operations.
<LI>

Replication over SSL now works.
<LI>

The <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE> statement now supports an <CODE>UNTIL</CODE> clause for
specifying that the slave SQL thread should be started but run only until it
reaches a given position in the master's binlogs or in the slave's relay logs.
<LI>

Create warnings also for simple (one row) <CODE>INSERT</CODE>. Before you had to set
<CODE>SQL_WARNING=1</CODE> for this to generate warnings.
<LI>

Added <CODE>delimiter</CODE> (<CODE>\d</CODE>) command to <CODE>mysql</CODE> for changing the
statement delimiter (terminator).
The default delimiter is semicolon.
<LI>

<CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns now have lengths measured
in characters rather than bytes.
Similarly, index values on such columns are measured in characters, not bytes.
The character size depends on the column's character set.
This means, for example, that a <CODE>CHAR(n)</CODE> column
for a multi-byte character set will take more storage than before.
<LI>

The <CODE>DATABASE()</CODE> function now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> rather than the empty
string if there is no database selected.
<LI>

Added option <CODE>--sql-mode=NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</CODE> to suppress usual
behaviour of generating the next sequence number when zero is stored in
an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column. With this mode enabled, only <CODE>NULL</CODE>
generates a sequence number.
<LI>

<STRONG>Warning: Incompatible change!</STRONG>
Client authentication now is based on 41-byte passwords in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table, not 45-byte passwords as in 4.1.0.
Any 45-byte passwords created for 4.1.0 must be reset after running the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script.
<LI>

<STRONG>Warning: Incompatible change!</STRONG>
Renamed <CODE>mysql_prepare_result()</CODE> to <CODE>mysql_get_metadata()</CODE> as
the old name was confusing.
<LI>

Added command <CODE>DROP USER 'username'@'hostname'</CODE>.
<LI>

The interface to aggregated UDF functions has changed a bit. One must now
declare a <CODE>clear</CODE> function for each aggregate function.
<LI>

<CODE>CONCAT_WS()</CODE> no longer skips empty strings.
<LI>

Added new functions <CODE>UTC_DATE()</CODE>, <CODE>UTC_TIME()</CODE>, and
<CODE>UTC_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new functions <CODE>DATE()</CODE>, <CODE>TIME()</CODE>, <CODE>TIMESTAMP()</CODE>,
<CODE>WEEKOFYEAR()</CODE>, <CODE>MICROSECOND()</CODE>, <CODE>ADDTIME()</CODE>, <CODE>SUBTIME()</CODE>,
<CODE>DATEDIFF()</CODE>, <CODE>TIMEDIFF()</CODE>, <CODE>MAKEDATE()</CODE>, <CODE>MAKETIME()</CODE>,
and <CODE>TIMEDIFF()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new syntax for <CODE>ADDDATE()</CODE> and <CODE>SUBDATE()</CODE>.
They now allow a numeric second argument representing the number of days to
be added to or subtracted from the first date argument.
<LI>

Added new <CODE>type</CODE> values <CODE>DAY_MICROSECOND</CODE>,
<CODE>HOUR_MICROSECOND</CODE>, <CODE>MINUTE_MICROSECOND</CODE>,
<CODE>SECOND_MICROSECOND</CODE>, and <CODE>MICROSECOND</CODE>
for <CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE>, <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>, and <CODE>EXTRACT()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new <CODE>%f</CODE> microseconds format specifier for <CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> and
<CODE>TIME_FORMAT()</CODE>.
<LI>

Enabled that all queries in which at least one <CODE>SELECT</CODE> does not
use indices properly get into slow query log when long log format is
used.  
<LI>

It is now possible to create <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables from <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables in
different databases. Formerly, all the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables had to be in the
same database, and the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table had to be created in that database
as well.
<LI>

Added new functions <CODE>COMPRESS()</CODE>, <CODE>UNCOMPRESS()</CODE>, and
<CODE>UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH()</CODE>.
<LI>

When doing <CODE>SET sql_mode='mode'</CODE> for a complex mode (like <CODE>ANSI</CODE>), we
now update the <CODE>sql_mode</CODE> variable to include all the individual options
implied by the complex mode.
<LI>

Added OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) function <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE>, which gives
you summary rows for each <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> level.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SQLSTATE</CODE> codes for all server errors.
<LI>

Added client API functions <CODE>mysql_sqlstate()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_stmt_sqlstate()</CODE> that return the SQLSTATE error code for the
last error.
<LI>

<CODE>TIME</CODE> columns with hours &#62; 24 (days) were returned incorrectly to the client.
<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> (and its
equivalents invoked from <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>) commands
are now stored in the binary log (hence are replicated to the slave),
except <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>, <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>, <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE>,
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>, and unless the optional
<CODE>NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG</CODE> keyword 
(or its alias <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>) was used. For a syntax example,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

New global variable <CODE>RELAY_LOG_PURGE</CODE> to enable or disable automatic
relay log purging.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> now produces warnings that can be fetched with
<CODE>SHOW WARNINGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added support for syntax <CODE>CREATE TABLE table2 (LIKE table1)</CODE>
that creates an empty table <CODE>table2</CODE> with a definition that is
exactly the same as <CODE>table1</CODE>, including any indexes.
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE TABLE table_name (...) TYPE=storage_engine</CODE> now generates a
warning if the named storage engine is not available. The table is still
created as a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, as before.
<LI>

Most subqueries are now much faster than before.
<LI>

Added alias <CODE>PURGE BINARY LOGS</CODE> for <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>PURGE LOGS</CODE> syntax is disabled (it had been added in version
4.1.0).
It is now <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS</CODE> or <CODE>PURGE BINARY LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added alias <CODE>SHOW BDB LOGS</CODE> for <CODE>SHOW LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added alias <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE> (which had been deleted in version
4.1.0) to <CODE>SHOW BINARY LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added a column <CODE>Slave_IO_State</CODE> (the state of the slave I/O thread)
and a column <CODE>Seconds_behind_master</CODE> (the number of seconds by
which the slave is late compared to the master) to the output of
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Error handling functions was not called properly when one got an error
from <CODE>[CREATE | REPLACE| INSERT] ... SELECT</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>HASH</CODE>, <CODE>BTREE</CODE>, <CODE>RTREE</CODE>, <CODE>ERRORS</CODE> and
<CODE>WARNINGS</CODE> are not reserved words anymore. (Bug #724)
<LI>

Fix for bug in <CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> when all tables were <CODE>const</CODE> tables.
(Bug #714)
<LI>

<CODE>--lower-case-table-names=1</CODE> now also makes aliases case
insensitive. (Bug #534)
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>UNION</CODE> which prohibited that <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are
inserted in result set where first <CODE>SELECT</CODE> contains <CODE>NOT
NULL</CODE> columns
<LI>

Fixed name resolution of fields of reduced subqueries in unions. (Bug #745)
<LI>

Fixed memory overrun in subqueries in select list with <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause
bigger than outer query <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. (Bug #726)
<LI>

Fixed a bug that caused <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes
created in 4.0.x to be unreadable in 4.1.x.
<LI>

Fixed a data loss bug in <CODE>REPAIR TABLE ... USE_FRM</CODE> when used
with tables
that contained <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> fields and were created in 4.0.x.
<LI>

Fixed reduced subquery processing in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>/<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
clauses. (Bug #442)
<LI>

Fixed name resolving of outer fields of subquery in
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>/<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> statements. (Bug #446)
<LI>

Fixed bug in marking fields of reduced subqueries. (Bug #679)
<LI>

Fixed a bug that made <CODE>CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX</CODE> syntax illegal.
<LI>

Fixed a crash when a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that required a temporary table
(marked by <CODE>Using temporary</CODE> in <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output)
was used as a derived table in <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command. (Bug #251)
<LI>

Fixed a rare table corruption bug in <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
from a big table with
a <STRONG>new</STRONG> (created by MySQL-4.1) fulltext index.
<LI>

<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> now returns 0 if the last <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
didn't insert any rows.
<LI>

Fixed missing last character in function output. (Bug #447)
<LI>

Fixed a rare replication bug when a transaction spanned two or more
relay logs, and the slave was stopped while executing the part
of the transaction that was in the second or later relay log. Then
replication would resume at the beginning of the second or later
relay log, which was wrong. (It should resume at <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>, in the
first relay log.) (Bug #53)
<LI>

<CODE>CONNECTION_ID()</CODE> is now properly replicated. (Bug #177)
<LI>

The new <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function in 4.1 is now properly replicated.
(Bug #344)
<LI>

Fixed bug with doubly freed memory.
<LI>

Fixed crashing bug in <CODE>UNION</CODE> operations that involved temporary tables.

used on a <CODE>DERIVED TABLES</CODE> with a join.
<LI>

Fixed a crashing bug in <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> caused by an uninitialized array of reference pointers.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>USER()</CODE> function caused by an error in the size of
the allocated string.
<LI>

Fixed a crashing bug when attempting to create a table with a spatial (GIS)
column type with a storage engine that does not support spatial types. 
<LI>

Fixed a crashing bug in <CODE>UNION</CODE> caused by the empty select list and
a non-existent field being used in some of the sub-selects.
<LI>

Fixed a replication bug when the master is 3.23 and the slave 4.0: The
slave lost the replicated temporary tables if <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> was
issued on the master. (Bug #254)
<LI>

Fixed a security bug: A server compiled without SSL support still allowed
connections by users that had the <CODE>REQUIRE SSL</CODE> option specified for
their accounts.
<LI>

When an undefined user variable was used in a updating query on the
master (like <CODE>INSERT INTO t VALUES(@a)</CODE> where <CODE>@a</CODE> had never
been set by this connection before), then the slave could replicate the
query wrongly if a previous transaction on the master used a user
variable of the same name. (Bug #1331)

<CODE>user</CODE> table.
<LI>

New <CODE>CRC32()</CODE> function to compute cyclic redundancy check value.

and client when they are running on the same machine and you are
connecting to <CODE>localhost</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables now uses less temporary disk space when
sorting char columns.
<LI>

<CODE>DATE</CODE>/<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> checking is now a bit stricter to support the 
ability to automatically distinguish between date, datetime, and time
with microseconds. For example, dates of type <CODE>YYYYMMDD HHMMDD</CODE> are no 
longer supported; you must either have separators between each
<CODE>DATE</CODE>/<CODE>TIME</CODE> part or not at all.
<LI>

Server side help for all MySQL functions. One can now type <CODE>help
week</CODE> in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client and get help for the <CODE>week()</CODE>
function.
<LI>

Added new C API client function: <CODE>mysql_get_server_version()</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>libmysqlclient</CODE> that fetched field defaults.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <TT>`mysql.cc'</TT> client when skipping comments

Added a support for <CODE>UNION</CODE> in derived tables.
<LI>

<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is now returned as a string of type
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> and different timestamp lengths are not supported.

This change was necessary for SQL standards compliance. In a future
version, a further change will be made (backward compatible with this
change), allowing the timestamp length to indicate the desired number
of digits of fractions of a second.
<LI>

New faster client/server protocol which supports prepared statements,
bound parameters, and bound result columns, binary transfer of data,
warnings.

warning in this case.
<LI>

One can specify the different <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> types with the
syntax <CODE>BLOB(length)</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT(length)</CODE>.  MySQL will
automatically change it to one of the internal <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE>
types.
<LI>

<CODE>CHAR BYTE</CODE> is an alias for <CODE>CHAR BINARY</CODE>.
<LI>

<UL>
<LI>

Write memory allocation information to error log when doing
<CODE>mysqladmin debug</CODE>.  This only works on system that support the
<CODE>mallinfo()</CODE> call (like newer Linux systems).
<LI>

Added the following new server variables to allow more precise memory
allocation: <CODE>range_alloc_block_size</CODE>, <CODE>query_alloc_block_size</CODE>,
<CODE>query_prealloc_size</CODE>, <CODE>transaction_alloc_block_size</CODE>, and
<CODE>transaction_prealloc_size</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> now reads options files. To make this work one must now
specify <CODE>--read-from-remote-server</CODE> when reading binary logs from
a MySQL server. (Note that using a remote server is deprecated and may
disappear in future <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> versions).
<LI>

Block <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> also for non-threaded programs. The blocking is moved
from <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to <CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE>, which is
automatically called on the first call to <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--libs_r</CODE> and <CODE>--include</CODE> options to <CODE>mysql_config</CODE>.
<LI>

New <CODE>`&#62;</CODE> prompt for <CODE>mysql</CODE>. This prompt is similar to the
<CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts, but indicates that an identifier
quoted with backticks was begun on an earlier line and the closing backtick
has not yet been seen.
<LI>

Updated <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> to be able to use the local machine's IP
address instead of the host name when building the initial grant tables if
<CODE>skip-name-resolve</CODE> has been specified in <CODE>my.cnf</CODE>. Using this
option can be helpful on FreeBSD to avoid thread-safety problems with the
FreeBSD resolver libraries. (Thanks to Jeremy Zawodny for the patch)
<LI>

A documentation change: added a note that when backing up a slave, one
needs to backup the <TT>`master.info'</TT> and <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT> files,
and the <TT>`SQL-LOAD*'</TT> files (which are in the
<TT>`slave-load-tmpdir'</TT> directory, which defaults to <TT>`tmpdir'</TT> if
unset). All these files will be needed when the slave resumes
replication after you restore the slave's data.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug when setting an enum system variable (like
<CODE>SQL_WARNINGS</CODE>) to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed server crash when running <CODE>FLUSH QUERY CACHE</CODE>. (Bug #988)
<LI>

Extended default timeout in clients on windows from 30 seconds to 1 year.
(The timeout that was added in MySQL 4.0.15 was way too short).
<LI>

More ``out of memory'' checking in range optimiser.
<LI>

Fixed and documented problem when setting and using a user variable in the
same <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement. (Bug #1194).
<LI>

Fixed bug in overrun check for blobs with compressed tables (bug
introduced in 4.0.14).  This caused MySQL to regard some correct tables
with blobs to be corrupted. (Bug #770, Bug #1304, and maybe Bug #1295)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> showed <CODE>USAGE</CODE> instead of real privileges for
column grants when no table grants was given.
<LI>

When it wanted to copy a database from the master, <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM
MASTER</CODE> dropped the corresponding database on the slave, thus dropping
tables which may not have a counterpart on the master, or tables which
may be excluded from replication using <CODE>replicate-*-table</CODE>
rules. Now <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> does not drop the database
anymore, it drops only the tables which have a counterpart on the master
and which match the <CODE>replicate-*-table</CODE>
rules. <CODE>replicate-*-db</CODE> rules can still be used to include/exclude a
database as a whole from <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE>. A database will
also be included/excluded as a whole if there are some rules like
<CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=db1.%</CODE> or
<CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=db1.%</CODE>, like it's already the case for
<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> in replication. (Bug
#1248)
<LI>

<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> crashed (segmentation fault) when used with the
<CODE>-h, --host</CODE> option. (Bug #1258)
<LI>

<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> crashed (segmentation fault) when used on binlog
containing only final events for <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>. (Bug #1340)
<LI>

Fixed compilation problem when compiling with OpenSSL 0.9.7 with
disabled old DES support (If <CODE>OPENSSL_DISABLE_OLD_DES_SUPPORT</CODE> 
option was enabled).
<LI>

Slave no longer can delete temporary files for <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>
(<TT>`SQL_LOAD-*'</TT>) belonging to other instances if these instances use the
same temporary directory. (Bug #1357)
<LI>

If <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> failed for a small file, the master forgot to
write a marker (a <CODE>Delete_file</CODE> event) in its binary log, so the slave
could not delete 2 files (<TT>`SQL_LOAD*.info'</TT> and
<TT>`SQL_LOAD*.data'</TT> from its <CODE>tmpdir</CODE>. (Bug #1391)
<LI>

On Windows, the slave forgot to delete a <CODE>SQL_LOAD*.info</CODE>
file from <TT>`tmpdir'</TT> after successfully replicating a <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE> command. (Bug #1392)
<LI>

When a connection terminates, MySQL writes <CODE>DROP TEMPORARY TABLE</CODE>
statements to the binary log for all temporary tables which the
connection had not explicitely dropped. MySQL forgot to backquote the
database and table names in the statement. (Bug #1345)
<LI>

On some 64-bit machines (some HP-UX and Solaris machines), a slave
installed with the 64-bit MySQL binary could not connect to its master
(it connected to itself instead). (Bug #1256, #1381)
<LI>

Code introduced in MySQL 4.0.15 for the slave to detect that the master
had died while writing a transaction to its binlog, reported an error in
a legal situation (when the slave I/O thread was stopped while copying a
transaction to the relay log, the slave SQL thread would later pretend
that it found an unfinished transaction). (Bug #1475)

<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.15" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.15">D.3.3  Changes in release 4.0.15 (03 Sep 2003)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> now correctly quotes all identifiers when communicating
with the server. This assures that during the dump process, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>
will never send queries to the server that result in a syntax error.
This problem is <STRONG>not</STRONG> related to the
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> program's output, which was not changed. (Bug #1148)
<LI>

Change result set metadata information so that <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE>
report that they can return <CODE>NULL</CODE> (this is true because an
empty set will return <CODE>NULL</CODE>). (Bug #324)
<LI>

Produce an error message on Windows if a second <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is
started on the same TCP/IP port as an already running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server variables <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>,
<CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE> and <CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE> now work on Windows.
<LI>

Added option <CODE>--sql-mode=NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</CODE> to make it possible for
slaves to ignore <CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE> and
<CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> options given to <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.
When this is mode is on, <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> will not show the
given directories.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> now shows the <CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE> and
<CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> options, if they were specified when the table was
created.
<LI>

The <CODE>open_files_limit</CODE> server variable now shows the real open files limit.
<LI>

<CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST()</CODE> in natural language mode
now treats words that are present
in more than 2,000,000 rows as stopwords.
<LI>

The Mac OS X installation disk images now include an additional
<TT>`MySQLStartupItem.pkg'</TT> package that enables the automatic
startup of MySQL on system bootup.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mac_OS_X_installation">2.1.3  Installing MySQL on Mac OS X</A>.
<LI>

Most of the documentation included in the binary tarball distributions
(<CODE>.tar.gz</CODE>) has been moved into a subdirectory <CODE>docs</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installation_layouts">2.2.7  Installation Layouts</A>.
<LI>

The manual is now included as an additional <CODE>info</CODE> file in the binary
distributions. (Bug #1019)
<LI>

The binary distributions now include the embedded server library 
(<CODE>libmysqld.a</CODE>) by default. Due to a linking problem with non-gcc
compilers, it was not included in all packages of the initial 4.0.15
release. The affected packages were rebuilt and released as 4.0.15a.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Nutshell_Embedded_MySQL">1.5.1.2  Embedded MySQL Server</A>.
<LI>

MySQL can now use range optimisation for <CODE>BETWEEN</CODE> with
non-constant limits. (Bug #991)
<LI>

Replication error messages now include the default database, so that
users can check which database the failing query was run for.
<LI>

A documentation change: Added a paragraph about how the
<CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE> and <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE> options are tested
against the database on the master (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>), and a
paragraph about how <CODE>replicate-do-db</CODE>, <CODE>replicate-do-table</CODE>
and analogous options are tested against the database and tables on the
slave (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Options">4.10.6  Replication Startup Options</A>).
<LI>

Now the slave does not replicate <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE>
if it is configured to exclude the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database from
replication (using for example
<CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%</CODE>). This was already the
case for <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> since version 4.0.13 (though
there was Bug #980 in 4.0.13 &#38; 4.0.14, which has been fixed in
4.0.15).
<LI>

Rewrote the information shown in the <CODE>State</CODE> column of <CODE>SHOW
PROCESSLIST</CODE> for replication threads and for <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE>
and added the most common states for these threads to the
documentation, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Implementation_Details">4.10.3  Replication Implementation Details</A>.
<LI>

Added a test in replication to detect the case where the master died
in the middle of writing a transaction to the binlog; such unfinished
transactions now trigger an error message on the slave.
<LI>

A <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command that creates an anonymous user
(that is, an account with an empty username) no longer requires
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> for the account to be recognized by the server.
(Bug #473)
<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> now flushes <TT>`relay-log.info'</TT>. Previously
this was deferred to the next run of <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>, so if
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> was shutdown on the slave after <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE>
without having run <CODE>START SLAVE</CODE>, the relay log's name and
position were lost. At restart they were reloaded from
<TT>`relay-log.info'</TT>, thus reverting to their old (incorrect) values from
before <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> and leading to error messages 
(as the old relay log did not exist any more) and the slave threads
refusing to start. (Bug #858)
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed buffer overflow in password handling which could potentially be
exploited by MySQL users with <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privilege on the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table to execute random code or to gain shell access with
the UID of the mysqld process (thanks to Jedi/Sector One for spotting and
reporting this bug).
<LI>

Fixed server crash on <CODE>FORCE INDEX</CODE> in a query that contained
"Range checked for each record" in the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output. (Bug #1172)
<LI>

Fixed table/column grant handling - proper sort order (from most specific
to less specific, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>) was not honored.
(Bug #928)
<LI>

Fixed rare bug in MYISAM introduced in 4.0.3 where the index file header
was not updated directly after an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> of split dynamic rows.
The symptom was that the table had a corrupted delete-link if mysqld
was shut down or the table was checked directly after the update.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>Can't unlock file</CODE> error when running
<CODE>myisamchk --sort-index</CODE> on Windows. (Bug #1119)
<LI>

Fixed possible deadlock when changing <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> while
the key cache was actively used. (Bug #1088)
<LI>

Fixed overflow bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> when a row is updated
in a table with a large number of columns and at least one <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE>
column.
<LI>

Fixed incorrect result when doing <CODE>UNION</CODE> and <CODE>LIMIT #,#</CODE> when
one didn't use braces around the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> parts.
<LI>

Fixed incorrect result when doing <CODE>UNION</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY .. LIMIT #</CODE>
when one didn't use braces around the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> parts.
<LI>

Fixed problem with <CODE>SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ... UNION ALL ... LIMIT #</CODE>
where <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> returned incorrect number of rows.
<LI>

Fixed unlikely stack bug when having a BIG expression of
type <CODE>1+1-1+1-1...</CODE> in certain combinations. (Bug #871)
<LI>

Fixed the bug that sometimes prevented a table with a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index
from being marked as "analyzed".
<LI>

Fixed MySQL so that the field length (in C API) for the second column in
<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> is always larger than the data length.
The only known application that was affected by the old behaviour was
Borland dbExpress, which truncated the output from the command.
(Bug #1064)
<LI>

Fixed crash in comparisons of strings using the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character
set. (Bug #1116)
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>ISAM</CODE> bug in <CODE>MAX()</CODE> optimisation.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk --sort-records=N</CODE> no longer marks table as crashed if
sorting failed because of an inappropriate key. (Bug #892)
<LI>

Fixed a minor bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> compressed table handling that sometimes
made it impossible to repair compressed table in "Repair by sort" mode.
"Repair with keycache" (<CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover</CODE>) worked, though.
(Bug #1015)
<LI>

Fixed bug in propagating the version number to the manual included in
the distribution files. (Bug #1020)
<LI>

Fixed key sorting problem (a <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> key declared for a column
that is not explicitly marked <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> was sorted after a
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key for a <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> column).
<LI>

Fixed the result of <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> when applied to a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value.
(Bug #792)
<LI>

Fixed compiling of the embedded server library in the RPM spec file.
(Bug #959)
<LI>

Added some missing files to the RPM spec file and fixed some RPM building
errors that occured on Red Hat Linux 9. (Bug #998)
<LI>

Fixed incorrect <CODE>XOR</CODE> evaluation in <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. (Bug #992)
<LI>

Fixed bug with processing in query cache merged tables constructed
from more then 255 tables. (Bug #930) 
<LI>

Fixed incorrect results from outer join query (e.g. <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>)
when <CODE>ON</CODE> condition is always false, and range search in used.  
(Bug #926)
<LI>

Fixed a bug causing incorrect results from <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST()</CODE> in some
joins. (Bug #942)
<LI>

<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables do not ignore "Using index" (from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output)
anymore.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that prevented an empty table from being marked as "analyzed".
(Bug #937)
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>myisamchk --sort-records</CODE> crash when used on compressed table.
<LI>

Fixed slow (as compared to 3.23)
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> and related commands such as <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>.
(Bug #712)
<LI>

Fixed segmentation fault resulting from <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> when
the master was running without the <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> option. (Bug #934)
<LI>

Fixed a security bug: A server compiled without SSL support still allowed
connections by users that had the <CODE>REQUIRE SSL</CODE> option specified for
their accounts.
<LI>

Fixed a random bug: Sometimes the slave would replicate <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
or <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> queries even if it was configured to exclude the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database from replication (for example, using
<CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%</CODE>). (Bug #980)
<LI>

The <CODE>Last_errno</CODE> and <CODE>Last_error</CODE> fields in the output of
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> are now cleared by <CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> and
when the slave SQL thread starts. (Bug #986)
<LI>

A documentation mistake: It said that <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE> does not change
connection information  (master host, port, user, and
password), whereas it does. The statement resets these to the startup options
(<CODE>master-host</CODE> etc) if there were some. (Bug #985)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> now shows correct information (master host,
port, user, and password) after <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>
(that is, it shows the new values, which are copied from the startup
options if there were some). (Bug #985)
<LI>

Disabled propagation of the original master's log position for events because
this caused unexpected values for <CODE>Exec_master_log_pos</CODE> and problems
with <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE> in A-&#62;B-&#62;C replication setup. (Bug #1086)
<LI>

Fixed a segfault in <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> when
<CODE>--position=x</CODE> was used with <CODE>x</CODE> being between a
<CODE>Create_file</CODE> event and its fellow <CODE>Append_block</CODE>,
<CODE>Exec_load</CODE> or <CODE>Delete_file</CODE> events. (Bug #1091)
<LI>

<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> printed superfluous warnings when using
<CODE>--database</CODE>, which caused syntax errors when piped to
<CODE>mysql</CODE>. (Bug #1092)
<LI>

Made <CODE>mysqlbinlog --database</CODE> filter <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> too
(previously, it filtered all queries except <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>). (Bug #1093)
<LI>

<CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> in some cases forgot to put a leading <CODE>'#'</CODE> in
front of the original <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> (this command is
displayed only for information, not to be run; it is later reworked to
<CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> with a different filename, for execution by
<CODE>mysql</CODE>). (Bug #1096)
<LI>

<CODE>binlog-do-db</CODE> and <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE> incorrectly filtered
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> (it was half-written to the binary log). This
resulted in a corrupted binary log, which could cause the slave to
stop with an error. (Bug #1100)
<LI>

When, in a transaction, a transactional table (such as an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table)
was updated, and later in the same transaction a
non-transactional table (such as a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table) was
updated using the updated content of the transactional table
(with <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> for example), the queries were written
to the binary log in an incorrect order. (Bug #873)
<LI>

When, in a transaction, <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> updated a
non-transactional table, and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> was issued, no error was
returned to the client. Now the client is warned that some changes
could not be rolled back, as this was already the case for normal
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>. (Bug #1113)
<LI>

Fixed a potential bug: When <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE> was run while the slave
SQL thread was in the middle of a transaction, and then <CODE>CHANGE
MASTER</CODE> was used to point the slave to some non-transactional
statement, the slave SQL thread could get confused (because it would
still think, from the past, that it was in a transaction).

<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.14" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.14">D.3.4  Changes in release 4.0.14 (18 Jul 2003)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now supports indexing a prefix of a column. This means, in
particular, that <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns can be indexed in
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, which was not possible before.
<LI>

A documentation change: Function <CODE>INTERVAL(NULL, ...)</CODE> returns <CODE>-1</CODE>.
<LI>

Enabled <CODE>INSERT</CODE> from <CODE>SELECT</CODE> when the table into which the records
are inserted is also a table listed in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE> from any <CODE>UNION</CODE>.
<LI>

The <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> option now always returns the total number 
of rows for any <CODE>UNION</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed <CODE>--table</CODE> option from <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> 
to avoid repeating <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> functionality.
<LI>

Changed optimiser slightly to prefer index lookups over full table scans
in some boundary cases.
<LI>

Added thread-specific <CODE>max_seeks_for_key</CODE> variable that can
be used to force the optimiser to use keys instead of table scans
even if the cardinality of the index is low.
<LI>

Added optimisation that converts <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> to normal join in
some cases.
<LI>

A documentation change: added a paragraph about failover in
replication (how to use a surviving slave as the new master, how to
resume to the original setup). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.9  Replication FAQ</A>.
<LI>

A documentation change: added warning notes about safe use of the
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHANGE_MASTER_TO">4.10.8.1  <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE></A>.
<LI>

MySQL now issues a warning (not an error, as in 4.0.13)
when it opens a table that was created with MySQL 4.1.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--nice</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> to allow setting the
niceness of the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process. (Thanks to Christian Hammers for
providing the initial patch.) (Bug #627)
<LI>

Added <CODE>--read-only</CODE> option to cause <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to allow no updates
except from slave threads or from users with the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.
(Original patch from Markus Benning).
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW BINLOG EVENTS FROM x</CODE> where <CODE>x</CODE> is less than 4 now
silently converts <CODE>x</CODE> to 4 instead of printing an error. The same change
was done for <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_POS=x</CODE> and 
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO RELAY_LOG_POS=x</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> now only adds an interrupt handler for the <CODE>SIGINT</CODE> signal
if you start it with the new <CODE>--gdb</CODE> option.  This is because some
MySQL users encountered strange problems when they accidentally sent <CODE>SIGINT</CODE> to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> threads.
<LI>

<CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE> now clears the <CODE>Last_errno</CODE> and
<CODE>Last_error</CODE> fields in the output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE> variable; the relay log will be rotated
automatically when its size exceeds <CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE>. But if
<CODE>max_relay_log_size</CODE> is 0 (the default), <CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>
will be used (as in older versions). <CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE> still
applies to binary logs in any case.
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> now rotates relay logs in addition to the other types of
logs it already rotated.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Comparison/sorting for <CODE>latin1_de</CODE> character set was rewritten.
The old algorithm could not handle cases like <CODE>"s@"a" &#62; "@ss{</CODE>a"}.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#German_character_set">4.6.1.1  German character set</A>. In rare cases it resulted in table
corruption.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with the password prompt on Windows. (Bug #683)
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... UNION=(...)</CODE> for <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table is now allowed
even if some underlying <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are read-only. (Bug #702)
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT x'41'</CODE>. (Bug #801)
<LI>

Removed some incorrect lock warnings from the error log.
<LI>

Fixed memory overrun when doing <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> on a table with a multi-part
auto_increment key where one part was a packed <CODE>CHAR</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a probable race condition in the replication code that could
potentially lead to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements not being replicated in the
event of a <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> command or when the binary log exceeds
<CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>. (Bug #791)
<LI>

Fixed a crashing bug in <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or 
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>. (Bug #807)
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> so it actually aborts for unsuccessful
table copying operations.  Fixed another bug so that it succeeds
when there are thousands of tables to copy. (Bug #812)
<LI>

Fixed problem with <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> failing to read options from option
files. (Bug #808)
<LI>

Fixed bugs in optimiser that sometimes prevented MySQL from using
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes even though it was possible (for example, in
<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE MATCH a,b AGAINST("index") &#62; 0</CODE>).
<LI>

Fixed a bug with ``table is full'' in <CODE>UNION</CODE> operations.
<LI>

Fixed a security problem that enabled users with no privileges to obtain
information on the list of existing databases by using <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> and
similar commands.
<LI>

Fixed a stack problem on UnixWare/OpenUnix.
<LI>

Fixed a configuration problem on UnixWare/OpenUNIX and OpenServer.
<LI>

Fixed a stack overflow problem in password verification.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>max_user_connections</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>HANDLER</CODE> without an index now works properly when a table has deleted 
rows. (Bug #787)
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> in <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>. (Bug #670)
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET DEFAULT</CODE> works. (Bug #462)
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table behaviour in <CODE>ORDER BY ... DESC</CODE> queries.
(Bug #515)
<LI>

Fixed server crash on <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>
when the binary log is off. (Bug #733)
<LI>

Fixed password-checking problem on Windows. (Bug #464)
<LI>

Fixed the bug in comparison of a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column and an integer
constant.  (Bug #504)
<LI>

Fixed remote mode of <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE>. (Bug #672)
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>ERROR 1105: Unknown error</CODE> that occurred for some <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
queries, where a column that was declared as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> was compared
with an expression that took <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.
<LI>

Changed timeout in <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> to use <CODE>poll()</CODE> instead of
<CODE>select()</CODE> to work around problem with many open files in the client.
<LI>

Fixed incorrect results from <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST</CODE> used with a
<CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> query.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that limited the maximum value for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variables
to 4294967295 when they are specified on the command line.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that sometimes caused spurious ``Access denied'' errors
in <CODE>HANDLER ... READ</CODE> statements, when a table is referenced
via an alias.
<LI>

Fixed portability problem with <CODE>safe_malloc</CODE>, which caused MySQL to
give "Freeing wrong aligned pointer" errors on SCO 3.2.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE/DISABLE KEYS</CODE> could cause a core dump when
done after an <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statement on the same table.
<LI>

Fixed problem with conversion of localtime to GMT where some times resulted in
different (but correct) timestamps. Now MySQL should use the smallest
possible timestamp value in this case.  (Bug #316)
<LI>

Very small query cache sizes could crash <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. (Bug #549)
<LI>

Fixed a bug (accidentally introduced by us but present only in version 4.0.13)
that made <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> into an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column
not replicate well. This bug is in the master, not in the slave.
(Bug #490)
<LI>

Fixed a bug: When an <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> statement inserted rows into a
non-transactional table, but failed at some point (for example, due to
a ``Duplicate key'' error), the query was not written to the binlog.
Now it is written to the binlog, with its error code, as all other
queries are. About the <CODE>slave-skip-errors</CODE> option for how to
handle partially completed queries in the slave, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Options">4.10.6  Replication Startup Options</A>. (Bug #491)
<LI>

<CODE>SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0</CODE> was not replicated properly.
The fix probably will not be backported to 3.23.
<LI>

On a slave, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> which had no <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> or
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> clause on the master, was replicated with <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>.
While this is not a problem if the master and slave data are identical
(a <CODE>LOAD</CODE> that produces no duplicate conflicts on the master will
produce none on the slave anyway), which is true in normal operation, it
is better for debugging not to silently add the <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>. That way,
you can get an error message on the slave and discover that for some
reason, the data on master and slave are different and investigate why.
(Bug #571)
<LI>

On a slave, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> printed an incomplete ``Duplicate entry
'%-.64s' for key %d''' message (the key name and value were not mentioned)
in case of duplicate conflict (which does not happen in normal operation).
(Bug #573)
<LI>

When using a slave compiled with <CODE>--debug</CODE>, <CODE>CHANGE MASTER
TO RELAY_LOG_POS</CODE> could cause a debug assertion failure. (Bug #576)
<LI>

When doing a <CODE>LOCK TABLES WRITE</CODE> on an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table, commit could
not happen, if the query was not written to the binary log (for example, if
<CODE>--log-bin</CODE> was not used, or <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE> was
used). (Bug #578)
<LI>

If a 3.23 master had open
temporary tables that had been replicated to a 4.0 slave, and
the binlog got rotated, these temporary tables were immediately 
dropped by the slave (which caused problems if the master used them
subsequently). This bug had been fixed in 4.0.13, but in a manner
which caused an unlikely inconvenience: if the 3.23 master died
brutally (power failure), without having enough time to automatically
write <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> statements to its binlog, then the 4.0.13
slave would not notice the temporary tables have to be dropped, until the
slave <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is restarted. This minor inconvenience is
fixed in 3.23.57 and 4.0.14 (meaning the master must be upgraded to
3.23.57 and the slave to 4.0.14 to remove the inconvenience). (Bug #254)
<LI>

If <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE> was waiting, and the slave was idle, and
the slave SQL thread terminated, <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE> would wait
forever. Now when the slave SQL thread terminates,
<CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE> immediately returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> (``slave
stopped''). (Bug #651)
<LI>

After <CODE>RESET SLAVE; START SLAVE;</CODE>, the <CODE>Relay_log_space</CODE> value
displayed by <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> was too big by four bytes. (Bug #763)
<LI>

If a query was ignored on the slave (because of
<CODE>replicate-ignore-table</CODE> and other similar rules), the slave
still checked if the query got the same error code (0, no error) as on
the master. So if the master had an error on the query (for example,
``Duplicate entry'' in a multiple-row insert), then the slave stopped
and warned that the error codes didn't match. (Bug #797)

<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.13" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.13">D.3.5  Changes in release 4.0.13 (16 May 2003)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> now implies <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>. (Bug #390)
<LI>

The Windows binary packages are now compiled with
<CODE>--enable-local-infile</CODE> to match the Unix build configuration.
<LI>

Removed timing of tests from <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>. <CODE>time</CODE> does not
accept all required parameters on many platforms (for example, QNX) and timing
the tests is not really required (it's not a benchmark anyway).
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> and <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> required the
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege; now they accept <CODE>REPLICATION CLIENT</CODE> as well.
(Bug #343)
<LI>

Added multi-threaded MyISAM repair optimisation and
<CODE>myisam_repair_threads</CODE> variable to enable it.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct</CODE> variable which controls amount of
dirty pages allowed in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> buffer pool.
<LI>

<CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE> and <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error messages now report the
hostname exactly as it was specified in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.
<LI>

Removed benchmark results from the source and binary distributions. They
are still available in the BK source tree, though.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables now support <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL now issues an error when it opens a table that was created with
MySQL 4.1.
<LI>

Option <CODE>--new</CODE> now changes binary items (<CODE>0xFFDF</CODE>) to be
treated as binary strings instead of numbers by default. This fixes some
problems with character sets where it's convenient to input the string
as a binary item.  After this change you have to convert the binary
string to <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> with a <CODE>CAST</CODE> if you want to compare two
binary items with each other and know which one is bigger than the other.
<CODE>SELECT CAST(0xfeff AS UNSIGNED) &#60; CAST(0xff AS UNSIGNED)</CODE>.
This will be the default behaviour in MySQL 4.1. (Bug #152)
<LI>

Enabled <CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE> on Linux (most modern glibc
libraries have a fixed <CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait</CODE>). (Bug #211)
<LI>

Don't create more insert delayed threads than given by
<CODE>max_insert_delayed_threads</CODE>. (Bug #211)
<LI>

Changed <CODE>UPDATE ... LIMIT</CODE> to also count accepted, but not changed rows.
<LI>

Tuned optimiser to favour clustered index over table scan.
<LI>

<CODE>BIT_AND()</CODE> and <CODE>BIT_OR()</CODE> now return an unsigned 64 bit value.
<LI>

Added warnings to error log of why a secure connection failed (when
running with <CODE>--log-warnings</CODE>).
<LI>

Deprecated options <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE> and <CODE>--use-symbolic-links</CODE> and
replaced these with <CODE>--symbolic-links</CODE>.
<LI>

The default option for <CODE>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</CODE> was changed
from 0 to 1 to make <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables ACID by default.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.3  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.
<LI>

Added a feature to <CODE>SHOW KEYS</CODE> to display keys that are disabled by 
<CODE>ALTER TABLE DISABLE KEYS</CODE> command.
<LI>

When using a non-existing table type with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>, first
try if the default table type exists before falling back to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> as an alias for <CODE>HEAP</CODE>.
<LI>

Renamed function <CODE>rnd</CODE> to <CODE>my_rnd</CODE> as the name was too generic
and is an exported symbol in <CODE>libmysqlclient</CODE> (thanks to Dennis Haney
for the initial patch).
<LI>

Portability fix: renamed <TT>`include/dbug.h'</TT> to
<TT>`include/my_debug.h'</TT>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> no longer silently deletes the binlogs when called with
<CODE>--master-data</CODE> or <CODE>--first-slave</CODE>;
while this behaviour was convenient for some
users, others may suffer from it. Now one has to explicitely ask for
this deletion with the new <CODE>--delete-master-logs</CODE> option.
<LI>

If the slave is configured (using for example
<CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%</CODE>)
to exclude <CODE>mysql.user</CODE>, <CODE>mysql.host</CODE>, <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql.tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>mysql.columns_priv</CODE> from
replication, then <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> will not be replicated.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Logged <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error message had wrong <CODE>Using password</CODE>
value. (Bug #398)
<LI>

Fixed bug with <CODE>NATURAL LEFT JOIN</CODE>, <CODE>NATURAL RIGHT JOIN</CODE> and
<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> when using many joined tables.  The problem was that
the <CODE>JOIN</CODE> method was not always associated with the tables
surrounding the <CODE>JOIN</CODE> method.  If you have a query that uses many
<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> or <CODE>NATURAL ... JOINS</CODE> you should check that they
work as you expected after upgrading MySQL to this version. (Bug #291)
<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> command line client no longer looks for <CODE>\*</CODE> commands
inside backtick-quoted strings.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>Unknown error</CODE> when using <CODE>UPDATE ... LIMIT</CODE>. (Bug #373)
<LI>

Fixed problem with ansi mode and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with constants. (Bug #387)
<LI>

Fixed bug with <CODE>UNION</CODE> and <CODE>OUTER JOIN</CODE>. (Bug #386)
<LI>

Fixed bug if one used a multi-table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and the query required a
temporary table bigger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>. (Bug #286)
<LI>

Run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> with the <CODE>-IN-RPM</CODE> option for the Mac OS X
installation to not fail on systems with improperly configured hostname
configurations.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> will now read <CODE>000000</CODE> as a zero date instead as
<CODE>"2000-00-00"</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug that caused <CODE>DELETE FROM table WHERE const_expression</CODE>
always to delete the whole table (even if expression result was false).
(Bug #355)
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug when using <CODE>FORMAT('nan',#)</CODE>. (Bug #284)
<LI>

Fixed name resolution bug with <CODE>HAVING ... COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed wrong result from truncation operator (<CODE>*</CODE>) in
<CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST()</CODE> in some complex joins.
<LI>

Fixed a crash in <CODE>REPAIR ... USE_FRM</CODE> command, when used on read-only,
nonexisting table or a table with a crashed index file.
<LI>

Fixed a crashing bug in mysql monitor program.
It occurred if program was started with <CODE>--no-defaults</CODE>, with a prompt
that contained hostname and connection to non-existing db was requested
<LI>

Fixed problem when comparing a key for a multi-byte-character set. (Bug #152)
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>LEFT</CODE>, <CODE>RIGHT</CODE> and <CODE>MID</CODE> when used with
multi-byte character sets and some <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries. (Bug #314)
<LI>

Fix problem with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> being discarded for some
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> queries. (Bug #275)
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1</CODE> works as documented (This corrects
a new bug introduced in 4.0)
<LI>

Fixed some serious bugs in <CODE>UPDATE ... ORDER BY</CODE>. (Bug #241)
<LI>

Fixed unlikely problem in optimising <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause with constant
expression like in <CODE>WHERE 1 AND (a=1 AND b=1)</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1</CODE> works again.
<LI>

Introduced proper backtick quoting for db.table in <CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index stopped working after <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
that converts <CODE>TEXT</CODE> field to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>. (Bug #283)
<LI>

Fixed a security problem with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and wildcarded select list,
when user only had partial column <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privileges on the table.
<LI>

Mark a MyISAM table as "analyzed" only when all the keys are indeed
analyzed.
<LI>

Only ignore world-writeable <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> files that are regular files
(and not, for example, named pipes or character devices).
<LI>

Fixed few smaller issues with <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed error message which contained deprecated text.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with two <CODE>NATURAL JOIN</CODE>s in the query.
<LI>

<CODE>SUM()</CODE> didn't return <CODE>NULL</CODE> when there was no rows in result
or when all values was <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

On Unix symbolic links handling was not enabled by default and there was
no way to turn this on.
<LI>

Added missing dashes to parameter <CODE>--open-files-limit</CODE> in
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>. (Bug #264)
<LI>

Fixed wrong hostname for TCP/IP connections displayed in
<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>NAN</CODE> in <CODE>FORMAT(...)</CODE> function ...
<LI>

Fixed a bug with improperly cached database privileges.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>ALTER TABLE ENABLE / DISABLE KEYS</CODE> which failed to
force a refresh of table data in the cache.
<LI>

Fixed bugs in replication of <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> for custom parameters 
(<CODE>ENCLOSED</CODE>,  <CODE>TERMINATED</CODE> and so on) and temporary tables.
(Bug #183, Bug #222)
<LI>

Fixed a replication bug when the master is 3.23 and the slave 4.0: the
slave lost the replicated temporary tables if <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> was
issued on the master. (Bug #254)
<LI>

Fixed a bug when doing <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE IGNORE</CODE>: When reading
the binary log, <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> and the replication code read <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>
instead of <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>. This could make the slave's table
become different from the master's table. (Bug #218)
<LI>

Fixed a deadlock when <CODE>relay_log_space_limit</CODE> was set to a too
small value. (Bug #79)
<LI>

Fixed a bug in HAVING clause when an alias is used from the
<STRONG>select list</STRONG>. 
<LI>

Fixed overflow bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> when a row is inserted into a table with a 
large number of columns and at least one <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE> column. Bug was caused
by incorrect calculation of the needed buffer to pack data.
<LI>

Fixed a bug when <CODE>SELECT</CODE> <STRONG>@nonexistent_variable</STRONG> caused the
error in client - server protocol due to net_printf() being sent to
the client twice.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in setting <CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE> option.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> which only displayed a localhost
in the <CODE>"Host"</CODE> column. This was caused by a glitch that only used
current thread information instead of information from the linked list of threads.
<LI>

Removed unnecessary Mac OS X helper files from server RPM. (Bug #144)
<LI>

Allow optimisation of multiple-table update for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables as well.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in multiple-table updates that caused some rows to be
updated several times.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> when it was called with
<CODE>--master-data</CODE>: the <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> commands appended to
the SQL dump had wrong coordinates. (Bug #159)
<LI>

Fixed a bug when an updating query using <CODE>USER()</CODE> was replicated
on the slave; this caused segfault on the slave. (Bug #178).
<CODE>USER()</CODE> is still badly replicated on the slave (it is
replicated to <CODE>""</CODE>).
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.12" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.12">D.3.6  Changes in release 4.0.12 (15 Mar 2003: Production)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> no longer reads options from world-writeable config files.
<LI>

Integer values between 9223372036854775807 and 9999999999999999999 are now
regarded as unsigned longlongs, not as floats. This makes these values work
similar to values between 10000000000000000000 and 18446744073709551615.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> will now include the client TCP port after the
hostname to make it easier to know from which client the request
originated.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crash on extremely small values of
<CODE>sort_buffer</CODE> variable.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO u SELECT ... FROM t</CODE> was written too late to the
binary log if t was very frequently updated during the execution of 
this query. This could cause a problem with <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> or
replication. The master must be upgraded, not the slave. (Bug #136)
<LI>

Fixed checking of random part of <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. (Bug #142)
<LI>

Fixed a bug with multiple-table updates with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
tables. This bug occurred as, in many cases, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables can not
be updated ``on the fly,'' but offsets to the records have to be stored in
a temporary table. 
<LI>

Added missing file <CODE>mysql_secure_installation</CODE> to the <CODE>server</CODE>
RPM subpackage. (Bug #141)
<LI>

Fixed MySQL (and <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>) crash on artificially
corrupted <CODE>.MYI</CODE> files.
<LI>

Don't allow <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> to overwrite existing files.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with multi-table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements when user had all privileges
on the database where tables are located and there were any entries in
<CODE>tables_priv</CODE> table, that is, <CODE>grant_option</CODE> was true.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that allowed a user with table or column grants on some table,
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> any table in the same database.
<LI>

Fixed deadlock when doing <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> followed by <CODE>DROP
TABLE</CODE> in the same thread.  In this case one could still kill the thread
with <CODE>KILL</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE> was not properly written to the binary
log (hence not properly replicated). (Bug #82)
<LI>

<CODE>RAND()</CODE> entries were not read correctly by <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> from
the binary log which caused problems when restoring a table that was
inserted with <CODE>RAND()</CODE>. <CODE>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(RAND())</CODE>. In
replication this worked ok.
<LI>

<CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE> was ignored for <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
queries. (Bug #104)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> reported too old positions
(columns <CODE>Relay_Master_Log_File</CODE> and <CODE>Exec_master_log_pos</CODE>)
for the last executed statement from the master, if this statement
was the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> of a transaction. The master must be upgraded for that,
not the slave. (Bug #52)
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> was not replicated by the slave if
<CODE>replicate_*_table</CODE> was set on the slave. (Bug #86)
<LI>

After <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>, the coordinates displayed by <CODE>SHOW
SLAVE STATUS</CODE> looked un-reset (though they were, but only
internally). (Bug #70)
<LI>

Fixed query cache invalidation on <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed memory leak on <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> procedure with error.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> columns that could cause wrong
results from the query.
<LI>

Fixed rare bug with wrong initialisation of <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column,
as a secondary column in a multi-column key (see section <A HREF="manual.html#example-AUTO_INCREMENT">3.6.9  Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE></A>), when
data was inserted with <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> into
an empty table.
<LI>

On Windows, <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE> didn't stop the slave until the slave
got one new command from the master (this bug has been fixed for MySQL 4.0.11
by releasing updated 4.0.11a Windows packages, which include this individual
fix on top of the 4.0.11 sources). (Bug #69)
<LI>

Fixed a crash when no database was selected and <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> command
was issued with full table name specified, including database prefix.
<LI>

Fixed a crash when shutting down replication on some platforms
(for example, Mac OS X).
<LI>

Fixed a portability bug with <CODE>pthread_attr_getstacksize</CODE> on
HP-UX 10.20 (Patch was also included in 4.0.11a sources).
<LI>

Fixed the <CODE>bigint</CODE> test to not fail on some platforms (for example, HP-UX and
Tru64) due to different return values of the <CODE>atof()</CODE> function.
<LI>

Fixed the <CODE>rpl_rotate_logs</CODE> test to not fail on certain platforms (e.g.
Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed <CODE>slave-master-info.opt</CODE>
to <CODE>.slave-mi</CODE>).
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.11" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.11">D.3.7  Changes in release 4.0.11 (20 Feb 2003)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> is now sorted <STRONG>LAST</STRONG> if you use <CODE>ORDER BY ... DESC</CODE>
(as it was before MySQL 4.0.2).  This change was required to comply
with the SQL-99 standard.  (The original change was made because we thought
that SQL-99 required <CODE>NULL</CODE> to be always sorted at the same position,
but this was incorrect).
<LI>

Added <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> (SQL-99 syntax) as alias for <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>.
This is recommended to use instead of <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> to start a transaction.
<LI>

Added <CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE> as a synonym for <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow keyword <CODE>ALL</CODE> in group functions.
<LI>

Added support for some new <CODE>INNER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>JOIN</CODE> syntaxes.
For example, <CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2</CODE> didn't work before.
<LI>

Novell NetWare 6.0 porting effort completed, Novell patches merged into
the main source tree.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed problem with multiple-table delete and <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>BLOB NOT NULL</CODE> columns used with <CODE>IS NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Re-added missing pre- and post(un)install scripts to the Linux RPM packages
(they were missing after the renaming of the server subpackage).
<LI>

Fixed that table locks are not released with multi-table updates and 
deletes with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> storage engine.
<LI>

Fixed bug in updating <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns with long strings.
<LI>

Fixed integer-wraparound when giving big integer (&#62;= 10 digits) to
function that requires an unsigned argument, like <CODE>CREATE TABLE (...) 
AUTO_INCREMENT=#</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>MIN(key_column)</CODE> could in some cases return <CODE>NULL</CODE> on a column
with <CODE>NULL</CODE> and other values.
<LI>

<CODE>MIN(key_column)</CODE> and <CODE>MAX(key_column)</CODE> could in some cases
return wrong values when used in <CODE>OUTER JOIN</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>MIN(key_column)</CODE> and <CODE>MAX(key_column)</CODE> could return wrong
values if one of the tables was empty.
<LI>

Fixed rare crash in compressed MyISAM tables with blobs.
<LI>

Fixed bug in using aggregate functions as argument for <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE>,
<CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD</CODE>, <CODE>CONCAT_WS</CODE>, <CODE>ELT</CODE> and
<CODE>MAKE_SET</CODE> functions.
<LI>

When running with <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> (default on Windows)

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

Added option <CODE>--log-error[=file_name]</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> and
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. This option will force all error messages to be put in a
log file if the option <CODE>--console</CODE> is not given. On Windows
<CODE>--log-error</CODE> is enabled as default, with a default name of
<CODE>host_name.err</CODE> if the name is not specified.
<LI>

Changed some things from <CODE>Warning:</CODE> to <CODE>Note:</CODE> in the log files.
<LI>

The mysqld server should now compile on NetWare.
<LI>

Added optimisation that if one does <CODE>GROUP BY ... ORDER BY NULL</CODE>
then result is not sorted.
<LI>

New <CODE>--ft-stopword-file</CODE> command-line option for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to
replace/disable the built-in stopword list that is used in full-text searches.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

Changed default stack size from 64K to 192K; This fixes a core dump
problem on Red Hat 8.0 and other systems with a <CODE>glibc</CODE> that requires a
stack size larger than 128K
for <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> to resolve a hostname. You can fix
this for earlier MySQL versions by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--thread-stack=192K</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>mysql_waitpid</CODE> to the binary distribution and the
<CODE>MySQL-client</CODE> RPM subpackage (required for <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>).
<LI>

Renamed the main <CODE>MySQL</CODE> RPM package to <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE>. When
updating from an older version, <CODE>MySQL-server.rpm</CODE> will simply replace
<CODE>MySQL.rpm</CODE>.
<LI>

If a slave is configured with <CODE>replicate_wild_do_table=db.%</CODE> or
<CODE>replicate_wild_ignore_table=db.%</CODE>, these rules will be applied to
<CODE>CREATE/DROP DATABASE</CODE>, too.
<LI>

Added timeout value for <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed initialisation of the random seed for newly created threads to
give a better <CODE>rand()</CODE> distribution from the first call.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that caused <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to hang when a
table was opened with the <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> command and then
dropped without being closed.
<LI>

Fixed bug in logging to binary log (which affects replication) a query
that inserts a <CODE>NULL</CODE> in an <CODE>auto_increment</CODE> field and also
uses <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed an unlikely bug that could cause a memory overrun when using
<CODE>ORDER BY constant_expression</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a table corruption in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>'s parallel repair mode.
<LI>

Fixed bug in query cache invalidation on simple table renaming.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>mysqladmin --relative</CODE>.
<LI>

On some 64 bit systems, <CODE>show status</CODE> reported a strange number for
<CODE>Open_files</CODE> and <CODE>Open_streams</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed wrong number of columns in <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> on empty table.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> that caused zero rows to be returned in
the case the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition was evaluated as <CODE>FALSE</CODE> after
reading const tables. (Unlikely condition).
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> didn't correctly flush table/column privileges
when <CODE>mysql.tables_priv</CODE> is empty.
<LI>

Fixed bug in replication when using <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> one a file
that updated and auto_increment field with <CODE>NULL</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE>. This
bug only affected MySQL 4.0 masters (not slaves or MySQL 3.23 masters).
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: If you have a slave that has replicated a file with
generated auto_increment fields then the slave data is corrupted and you
should reinitialise the affected tables from the master.
<LI>

Fixed possible memory overrun when sending a blob &#62; 16M to the client.
<LI>

Fixed wrong error message when setting a <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> field to an
expression that returned <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>str LIKE "%other_str%"</CODE> where <CODE>str</CODE> or
<CODE>other_str</CODE> contained characters &#62;= 128.
<LI>

Fixed bug: When executing on master <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> and <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> failed
with <CODE>table full</CODE> error the binary log was corrupted.

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> will for MyISAM tables treat all <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values as different when calculating cardinality.  This helps in
optimising joins between tables where one of the tables has a lot of
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values in a indexed column:

<PRE>
SELECT * from t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.key_with_a_lot_of_null;
</PRE>

<LI>

Added join operator <CODE>FORCE INDEX (key_list)</CODE>. This acts likes
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> but with the addition that a table scan is
assumed to be VERY expensive.  One bad thing with this is that it makes
<CODE>FORCE</CODE> a reserved word.
<LI>

Reset internal row buffer in MyISAM after each query. This will reduce
memory in the case you have a lot of big blobs in a table.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

A security patch in 4.0.8 causes the mysqld server to die if the remote
hostname can't be resolved. This is now fixed.
<LI>

Fixed crash when replication big <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement that
caused log rotation.
</UL>

Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

Default <CODE>max_packet_length</CODE> for libmysqld.c is now 1024*1024*1024.
<LI>

One can now specify <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> in a file ready by
<CODE>mysql_options(MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE)</CODE>.
for clients.
<LI>

When sending a too big packet to the server with the not compressed
protocol, the client now gets an error message instead of a lost
connection.
<LI>

We now send big queries/result rows in bigger hunks, which should give a
small speed improvement.
<LI>

Fixed some bugs with the compressed protocol for rows &#62; 16M.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables now also support <CODE>ON UPDATE CASCADE</CODE> in
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraints. See the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> section in the manual
for the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> changelog.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> with BDB tables.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>QUOTE()</CODE> function.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling communication packets bigger than
16M. Unfortunately this required a protocol change; If you upgrade the
server to 4.0.8 and above and have clients that uses packets &#62;=
255*255*255 bytes (=16581375) you must also upgrade your clients to at
least 4.0.8.  If you don't upgrade, the clients will hang when sending a
big packet.
<LI>

Fixed bug when sending blobs longer than 16M to client.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> when used on BLOB column with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in <CODE>CASE</CODE> ... WHEN ...

<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> now also reports the compiler version used for building
the binaries (if the compiler supports the option <CODE>--version</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<LI>

Fixed compilation problems on OpenUnix and HPUX 10.20.
<LI>

Fixed some optimisation problems when compiling MySQL with <CODE>-DBIG_TABLES</CODE>
on a 32 bit system.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_drop_db()</CODE> didn't check permissions properly so anyone could
drop another users database.  <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> is checked properly.

<UL>
<LI>

Added syntax support for <CODE>CHARACTER SET xxx</CODE> and <CODE>CHARSET=xxx</CODE>
table options (to be able to read table dumps from 4.1).
<LI>

Fixed replication bug that caused the slave to loose its position in
some cases when the replication log was rotated.
<LI>

Fixed that a slave will restart from the start of a transaction if
it's killed in the middle of one.
<LI>

Moved the manual pages from <TT>`man'</TT> to <TT>`man/man1'</TT> in the
binary distributions.
<LI>

The default type returned by <CODE>IFNULL(A,B)</CODE> is now set to be the
more 'general' of the types of <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>. (The order is
<CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>).
<LI>

Moved the <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> startup script in the RPM packages from
<TT>`/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql'</TT> to <TT>`/etc/init.d/mysql'</TT>
(which almost all current Linux distributions support for LSB compliance).
<LI>

Added <CODE>Qcache_lowmem_prunes</CODE> status variable (number of queries that were
deleted from cache because of low memory).
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> so it can deal with table names containing dashes.
<LI>

Bulk insert optimisation
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.7.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>)
is no longer used when inserting small (less than 100) number of rows.
<LI>

Optimisation added for queries like
<CODE>SELECT ... FROM merge_table WHERE indexed_column=constant_expr</CODE>.
<LI>

Added functions <CODE>LOCALTIME</CODE> and <CODE>LOCALTIMESTAMP</CODE> as synonyms for
<CODE>NOW()</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>CEIL</CODE> is now an alias for <CODE>CEILING</CODE>.
<LI>

The <CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE> function can be used to get a <CODE>user@host</CODE>
value as it was matched in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> system.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>CHECK</CODE> constraints to be compatible with SQL-99. This made
<CODE>CHECK</CODE> a reserved word. (Checking of <CODE>CHECK</CODE> constraints is
still not implemented).
<LI>

Added <CODE>CAST(... as CHAR)</CODE>.
<LI>

Added PostgreSQL compatible <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> syntax:
<CODE>SELECT ... LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE> will now reset the connection to the state
of a fresh connect (Ie, <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> any active transaction, close
all temporary tables, reset all user variables etc..)
<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE MASTER</CODE> and <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE> now require that slave
threads be both already stopped; these commands will return an error
if at least one of these two threads is running.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed number of found rows returned in <CODE>multi table updates</CODE>
<LI>

Make <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> default on Mac OS X as the default
file system (HFS+) is case insensitive.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.
<LI>

Transactions in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE> mode didn't rotate binary log.
<LI>

A fix for the bug in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> with joined tables with
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause when filesort had to be used.
In that case <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> was applied to filesort of one of the tables,
although it could not be.
This fix also solved problems with <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE> now makes a copy of all arguments. This fixes
a problem when using the embedded server in C# program.
<LI>

Fixed buffer overrun in <CODE>libmysqlclient</CODE> library
that allowed a malicious <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server to crash the client
application.
<LI>

Fixed security-related bug in <CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE> handling.
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.6.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> from working.
<LI>

Fixed bug in phrase operator <CODE>"..."</CODE> in boolean full-text search.
<LI>

Fixed bug that caused <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> to corrupt the table
under some rare circumstances.
<LI>

Part rewrite of multi-table-update to optimise it, make it safer and
more bug free.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> now works together with multi-table-update and
multi-table-delete.
<LI>

<CODE>--replicate-do=xxx</CODE> didn't work for <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> commands.
(Bug introduced in 4.0.0)
<LI>

Fixed shutdown problem on Mac OS X.
<LI>Major <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> bugs in <CODE>REPLACE, AUTO_INCREMENT,

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Port number was added to host name (if it is known) in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>
command
<LI>

Changed handling of last argument in <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> so that one can get
week number according to the ISO 8601 specification.
(Old code should still work).
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> threads doesn't hang on <CODE>Waiting for
INSERT</CODE> when one sends a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> to mysqld.
<LI>

Change that <CODE>AND</CODE> works according to SQL-99 when it comes to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> handling. In practice, this only affects queries where you
do something like <CODE>WHERE ... NOT (NULL AND 0)</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will now resolve <CODE>basedir</CODE> to its full path (with
<CODE>realpath()</CODE>). This enables one to use relative symlinks to the
MySQL installation directory.  This will however cause <CODE>show
variables</CODE> to report different directories on systems where there is
a symbolic link in the path.
<LI>

Fixed that MySQL will not use index scan on index disabled with
<CODE>IGNORE INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>USE INDEX</CODE>.
to be ignored.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--use-frm</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>. When used with
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, it gets the table structure from the <CODE>.frm</CODE> file, so the
table can be repaired even if the <CODE>.MYI</CODE> header is corrupted.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>MAX()</CODE> optimisation when used with <CODE>JOIN</CODE> and
<CODE>ON</CODE> expressions.
<LI>

Added support for reading of MySQL 4.1 table definition files.
<LI>

<CODE>BETWEEN</CODE> behaviour changed (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Comparison_Operators">6.3.1.2  Comparison Operators</A>).
Now <CODE>datetime_col BETWEEN timestamp AND timestamp</CODE> should work
as expected.
<LI>

One can create <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables now.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM myisam_table</CODE> now shrinks not only the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file but
also the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file.
<LI>

When one uses the <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>
it's now passed on to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> from <CODE>'where used'</CODE> to
<CODE>'Using where'</CODE> to make it more in line with other output.
<LI>

Removed variable <CODE>safe_show_database</CODE> as it was no longer used.
<LI>

Updated source tree to be built using <CODE>automake 1.5</CODE> and 
<CODE>libtool 1.4</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed an inadvertently changed option (<CODE>--ignore-space</CODE>) back to the
original <CODE>--ignore-spaces</CODE> in <CODE>mysqlclient</CODE>. (Both syntaxes will
work).
<LI>

Don't require <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> privilege when using <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>.
<LI>

Added support for <CODE>DROP TEMPORARY TABLE ...</CODE>, to be used to make
replication safer.
<LI>

When transactions are enabled, all commands that update temporary tables
inside a <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT</CODE> are now stored in the binary log on
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and not stored if one does <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>.  This fixes
some problems with non-transactional temporary tables used inside
transactions.
<LI>

Allow braces in joins in all positions. Formerly, things like
<CODE>SELECT * FROM (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 USING (a)), t1</CODE> worked, but
not <CODE>SELECT * FROM t1, (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 USING (a))</CODE>. Note that
braces are simply removed, they do not change the way the join is
executed.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now supports also isolation levels
<CODE>READ UNCOMMITTED</CODE> and <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>.
For a detailed <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> changelog, see section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_change_history">7.5.16  InnoDB Change History</A>

Fixed a bug that limited <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> key length to a value
slightly less that 500. It is exactly 500 now.
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> on columns that may have a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value
doesn't always use disk based temporary tables.
<LI>

The filename argument for the <CODE>--des-key-file</CODE> argument to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
is interpreted relative to the data directory if given as a relative pathname.
<LI>

Removed a condition that temp table with index on column that can be
<CODE>NULL</CODE> has to be <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. This was okay for 3.23, but not
needed in 4.*. This resulted in slowdown in many queries since 4.0.2.

Small code improvement in multi-table updates.
<LI>

Fixed a newly introduced bug that caused <CODE>ORDER BY ... LIMIT row_count</CODE>
to not return all rows.

Fixed bug in <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST( ... IN BOOLEAN MODE)</CODE>
used with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> and <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE> privilege on
the database level.  One must run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE>
script on old installations to activate these.
<LI>

In <CODE>SHOW TABLE ... STATUS</CODE>, compressed tables sometimes showed up as
<CODE>dynamic</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT @@[global|session].var_name</CODE> didn't report
<CODE>global | session</CODE> in the result column name.
<LI>

Fixed problem in replication that <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> in a circular
replication setup created an infinite number of binary log files.
Now a <CODE>rotate-binary-log</CODE> command in the binary log will not cause slaves
to rotate logs.
<LI>

Removed <CODE>STOP EVENT</CODE> from binary log when doing <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Disable the use of <CODE>SHOW NEW MASTER FOR SLAVE</CODE> as this needs to be
completely reworked in a future release.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with constant expression (for example, field of a one-row table, or field
from a table, referenced by a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key) appeared in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
part of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>--log-binary=a.b.c</CODE> now properly strips off <CODE>.b.c</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> removed numerical extension for all future update logs.
<LI>

<CODE>GRANT ... REQUIRE</CODE> didn't store the SSL information in the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table if SSL was not enabled in the server.
<LI>

<CODE>GRANT ... REQUIRE NONE</CODE> can now be used to remove SSL information.
<LI>

<CODE>AND</CODE> is now optional between <CODE>REQUIRE</CODE> options.
<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE</CODE> option was not properly saved, which could cause strange
output in <CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>mysqld --help</CODE> reports correct values for <CODE>--datadir</CODE>

Added <CODE>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> to the set of flags that may be
specified with the <CODE>--sql-mode</CODE> option for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  It disables
unsigned arithmetic rules when it comes to subtraction. (This will make
MySQL 4.0 behave more like 3.23 with <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> columns).

The result returned for all bit functions (<CODE>|</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>, ...) is now of
type <CODE>unsigned integer</CODE>.

Fixed optimisation problem where the MySQL Server was in ``preparing'' state
for a long time when selecting from an empty table which had contained

<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>FLUSH QUERY CACHE</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>CAST()</CODE> and <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> functions. The <CODE>CAST</CODE> and

Changed output format of <CODE>SHOW OPEN TABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>SELECT expression LIMIT ...</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="News-3.23.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.x">D.4  Changes in release 3.23.x (Recent; still supported)</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2084"></A>

</P>
<P>
Please note that since release 4.0 is now production level, only critical
fixes are done in the 3.23 release series. You are recommended to upgrade
when possible, to take advantage of all speed and feature improvements in
4.0. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-from-3.23">2.5.2  Upgrading From Version 3.23 to 4.0</A>.

</P>
<P>
The 3.23 release has several major features that are not
present in previous versions.  We have added three new
table types:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
<DD>
A new ISAM library which is tuned for SQL and supports large files.
<DT><CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
<DD>
A transaction-safe storage engine that supports row level locking, and many
Oracle-like features.
<DT><CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> or <CODE>BDB</CODE>
<DD>
Uses the Berkeley DB library from Sleepycat Software to implement
transaction-safe tables.
</DL>

<P>
Note that only <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is available in the standard binary distribution.

</P>
<P>
The 3.23 release also includes support for database replication between
a master and many slaves, full-text indexing, and much more.

</P>
<P>
All new features are being developed in the 4.x version.  Only
bug fixes and minor enhancements to existing features will be
added to 3.23.

</P>
<P>
The replication code and BerkeleyDB code is still not as tested and as
the rest of the code, so we will probably need to do a couple of future
releases of 3.23 with small fixes for this part of the code. As long as
you don't use these features, you should be quite safe with
MySQL 3.23!

</P>
<P>
Note that the above doesn't mean that replication or Berkeley DB don't
work.  We have done a lot of testing of all code, including replication
and <CODE>BDB</CODE> without finding any problems.  It only means that not as many
users use this code as the rest of the code and because of this we are
not yet 100% confident in this code.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.59" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.59">D.4.1  Changes in release 3.23.59 (not released yet)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

If a query was ignored on the slave (because of
<CODE>replicate-ignore-table</CODE> and other similar rules), the slave
still checked if the query got the same error code (0, no error) as on
the master. So if the master had an error on the query (for example,
``Duplicate entry'' in a multiple-row insert), then the slave stopped
and warned that the error codes didn't match. This is a backport of the
fix for MySQL 4.0. (Bug #797)
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.58" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.58">D.4.2  Changes in release 3.23.58 (11 Sep 2003)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fixed buffer overflow in password handling which could potentially be
exploited by MySQL users with <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privilege on the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table to execute random code or to gain shell access with
the UID of the mysqld process (thanks to Jedi/Sector One for spotting and
reporting this bug).
<LI>

<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> now correctly quotes all identifiers when communicating
with the server. This assures that during the dump process, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>
will never send queries to the server that result in a syntax error. This
problem is <STRONG>not</STRONG> related to the <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> program's output,
which was not changed. (Bug #1148)
<LI>

Fixed table/column grant handling - proper sort order (from most specific
to less specific, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>) was not honored. (Bug #928)
<LI>

Fixed overflow bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> when a row is updated
in a table with a large number of columns and at least one <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE>
column.
<LI>

Fixed MySQL so that field length (in C API) for the second column in
<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> is always larger than the data length.
The only known application that was affected by the old behaviour was
Borland dbExpress, which truncated the output from the command.
(Bug #1064)
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>ISAM</CODE> bug in <CODE>MAX()</CODE> optimisation.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>Unknown error</CODE> when doing <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on reference table which
was used with <CODE>NULL</CODE> value on <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> column. (Bug #479)
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.57" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.57">D.4.3  Changes in release 3.23.57 (06 Jun 2003)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fixed problem in alarm handling that could cause problems when getting a
packet that is too large.
<LI>

Fixed problem when installing MySQL as a service on Windows when one
gave 2 arguments (option file group name and service name) to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>kill pid-of-mysqld</CODE> to work on Mac OS X.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> displayed incorrect <CODE>Row_format</CODE> value for
tables that have been compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.
(Bug #427)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_data_file_path'</CODE> displayed only the
name of the first datafile. (Bug #468)
<LI>

Fixed security problem where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> didn't allow one to <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
rows in a table even if one had a global <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> privilege and a
database <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege.
<LI>

Fixed a security problem with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and wildcarded select list,
when user only had partial column <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privileges on the table.
<LI>

Fixed unlikely problem in optimising <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause with a constant
expression such as in <CODE>WHERE 1 AND (a=1 AND b=1)</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed problem on IA-64 with timestamps that caused <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> to fail.
<LI>

The default option for <CODE>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</CODE> was changed
from 0 to 1 to make <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables ACID by default.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.3  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.
<LI>

Fixed problem with too many allocated alarms on slave when connecting to
master many times (normally not a very critical error).
<LI>

Fixed a bug in replication of temporary tables. (Bug #183)
<LI>

Fixed 64 bit bug that affected at least AMD hammer systems.
<LI>

Fixed a bug when doing <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE IGNORE</CODE>: When reading
the binary log, <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> and the replication code read <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>
instead of <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>. This could make the slave's table
become different from the master's table. (Bug #218)
<LI>

Fixed overflow bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> when a row is inserted into a table with a 
large number of columns and at least one <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE> column. Bug was caused
by incorrect calculation of the needed buffer to pack data.
<LI>

The binary log was not locked during <CODE>TRUNCATE table_name</CODE> or
<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> statements, which could cause an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to
<CODE>table_name</CODE> to be written to the log before the
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements.
<LI>

Fixed rare bug in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> of <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables where one row could be
updated multiple times.
<LI>

Produce an error for empty table and column names.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>PROCEDURE ANALYSE()</CODE> to report <CODE>DATE</CODE> instead of
<CODE>NEWDATE</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>PROCEDURE ANALYSE(#)</CODE> to restrict the number of values in an
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> column to <CODE>#</CODE> also for string values.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> no longer silently deletes the binary logs when invoked with
the <CODE>--master-data</CODE> or <CODE>--first-slave</CODE> option;
while this behaviour was convenient for some
users, others may suffer from it. Now one has to explicitly ask for binary
logs to be deleted by using the new <CODE>--delete-master-logs</CODE> option.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> when it was invoked with the
<CODE>--master-data</CODE> option: The <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> statements that were
appended to the SQL dump had incorrect coordinates. (Bug #159)
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.56" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.56">D.4.4  Changes in release 3.23.56 (13 Mar 2003)</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>

<LI>

Fixed a rare bug when using a date in <CODE>HAVING</CODE> with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed checking of random part of <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. (Bug #142)
<LI>

Fixed MySQL (and <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>) crash on artificially
corrupted <TT>`.MYI'</TT> files.
<LI>

Security enhancement:
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> no longer reads options from world-writeable config files.
<LI>

Security enhancement:
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> and <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> now only use the first <CODE>--user</CODE>
option specified on the command line. (Normally this comes from
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>)
<LI>

Security enhancement:
Don't allow <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> to overwrite existing files.
<LI>

Fixed unlikely deadlock bug when one thread did a <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> and
another thread did a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>.  In this case one could do
a <CODE>KILL</CODE> on one of the threads to resolve the deadlock.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> was not replicated by slave if
<CODE>replicate_*_table</CODE> was set on the slave.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> columns that could cause wrong
results from the query.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> on 64-bit platforms. The bug was
caused by wrong declaration of variable <CODE>server_id</CODE>.
<LI>

The Comment column in <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> now reports that it can
contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> values (which is the case for a crashed <TT>`.frm'</TT> file).
<LI>

Fixed the <CODE>rpl_rotate_logs</CODE> test to not fail on certain platforms (e.g.
Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed <CODE>slave-master-info.opt</CODE>
to <CODE>.slave-mi</CODE>).
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>BLOB NOT NULL</CODE> columns used with <CODE>IS NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>MAX()</CODE> optimisation in <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Better <CODE>RAND()</CODE> initialisation for new connections.
<LI>

Fixed bug with connect timeout. This bug was manifested on OS's with 
<CODE>poll()</CODE> system call, which resulted in timeout the value specified as
it was executed in both <CODE>select()</CODE> and <CODE>poll()</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table WHERE datetime1 IS NULL OR datetime2 IS NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in using aggregate functions as argument for <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE>,
<CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD</CODE>, <CODE>CONCAT_WS</CODE>, <CODE>ELT</CODE> and
<CODE>MAKE_SET</CODE> functions.
<LI>

When running with <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> (default on Windows)
and you had tables or databases with mixed case on disk, then
executing <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> followed with <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>
or <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> could fail with <CODE>Errcode 13</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in logging to binary log (which affects replication) a query
that inserts a <CODE>NULL</CODE> in an <CODE>auto_increment</CODE> field and also
uses <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>mysqladmin --relative</CODE>.
<LI>

On some 64 bit systems, <CODE>show status</CODE> reported a strange number for
<CODE>Open_files</CODE> and <CODE>Open_streams</CODE>.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed double <CODE>free</CODE>'d pointer bug in <CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE>
handling, that enabled a specially hacked version of MySQL client
to crash <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. <STRONG>Note</STRONG>, that one needs to login to the server
by using a valid user account to be able to exploit this bug.
<LI>

Fixed bug with the <CODE>--slow-log</CODE> when logging an administrator command
(like <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>).
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> when used on BLOB column with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in <CODE>CASE ... WHEN ...</CODE>.
<LI>

Bugfix for <CODE>--chroot</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#News-3.23.54">D.4.6  Changes in release 3.23.54 (05 Dec 2002)</A>)
is reverted. Unfortunately, there is no way to make it to work, without
introducing backward-incompatible changes in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.
Those who need <CODE>--chroot</CODE> functionality, should upgrade to MySQL 4.0.
(The fix in the 4.0 branch did not break backward-compatibility).
<LI>

Make <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> default on Mac OS X as the default
file system (HFS+) is case insensitive.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <TT>`scripts/mysqld_safe.sh'</TT> in <CODE>NOHUP_NICENESS</CODE>
testing.
<LI>

Transactions in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE> mode didn't rotate binary log.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>scripts/make_binary_distribution</CODE> that resulted in
a remaining <CODE>@HOSTNAME@</CODE> variable instead of replacing it with the
correct path to the <CODE>hostname</CODE> binary.
<LI>

Fixed a very unlikely bug that could cause <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> to core
dump in pthread_mutex_unlock() if a new thread was connecting.
<LI>

Forbid <CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE> if the thread executing the query has locked
tables.  This removes a possible deadlock situation.

<UL>
<LI>

Don't give warning for a statement that is only a comment; this is needed for
<CODE>mysqldump --disable-keys</CODE> to work.
<LI>

Fixed unlikely caching bug when doing a join without keys. In this case
the last used field for a table always returned <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Added options to make <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE> more secure.
<LI>

MySQL binary release 3.23.48 for Linux contained a new <CODE>glibc</CODE> library,
which has serious problems under high load and Red Hat 7.2.  The 3.23.49 binary
release doesn't have this problem.
<LI>

Fixed shutdown problem on NT.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.48" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.48">D.4.12  Changes in release 3.23.48 (07 Feb 2002)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Added <CODE>--xml</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> for producing XML output.
<LI>

Changed to use <CODE>autoconf</CODE> 2.52 (from <CODE>autoconf</CODE> 2.13)
<LI>

Fixed bug in complicated join with <CODE>const</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Added internal safety checks for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<LI>

Some <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> variables were always shown in <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> as
<CODE>OFF</CODE> on high-byte-first systems (like SPARC).
<LI>

Fixed problem with one thread using an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table and another
thread doing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on the same table. Before that,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> could crash with an assertion failure in <TT>`row0row.c'</TT>,
line 474.
<LI>

Tuned the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> SQL optimiser to favor index searches more often
over table scans.
<LI>

Fixed a performance problem with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables when several large
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries are run concurrently on a multiprocessor Linux
computer.  Large CPU-bound <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries will now also generally
run faster on all platforms.
<LI>

If MySQL binlogging is used, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now prints after crash recovery the
latest MySQL binlog name and the offset <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> was able to recover
to. This is useful, for example, when resynchronising a master and a
slave database in replication.
<LI>

Added better error messages to help in installation problems of <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
tables.
<LI>

It is now possible to recover MySQL temporary tables that have become
orphaned inside the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tablespace.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now prevents a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> declaration where the
signedness is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.
<LI>

Calling <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> could cause
memory corruption and make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crash.  Especially at risk was
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, because it frequently calls <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE>.
<LI>

If inserts to several tables containing an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column were
wrapped inside one <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> asserted in
<TT>`lock0lock.c'</TT>.
<LI>

In 3.23.47 we allowed several <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> secondary
index for an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table.  But <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> was not relaxed: it
reports the table as corrupt.  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> no longer complains in
this situation.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> now shows <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> instead of <CODE>REFERENCE</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.47" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.47">D.4.13  Changes in release 3.23.47 (27 Dec 2001)</A></H3>

now much longer.)
<LI>

Fixed default values for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>GROUP BY expr DESC</CODE> works.
<LI>

Fixed bug when using <CODE>t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t2.key=constant</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_config</CODE> now also works with binary (relocated) distributions.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed problem with aliased temporary table replication.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables will now use index when doing an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on the whole table.
<LI>

Fixed bug where one got an empty set instead of a DEADLOCK error when using
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

One can now kill <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, and <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> when
the thread is waiting to get a lock on the table.
<LI>

Fixed race condition in <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug when joining with caching (unlikely to happen).
<LI>

Fixed race condition when using the binary log and <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
which could cause the binary log to have rows that were not yet written
to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Changed caching of binary log to make replication slightly faster.
<LI>

Fixed bug in replication on Mac OS X.
</UL>

Accent characters in the default character set <CODE>latin1</CODE> are ordered
according to the MySQL ordering.

Note: if you are using <CODE>latin1</CODE> and have inserted characters whose
code is greater than 127 into an indexed <CODE>CHAR</CODE> column, you should
run <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> on your table when you upgrade to 3.23.44, and

Lots of portability fixes for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed optimiser so that queries like
<CODE>SELECT * FROM tbl_name,tbl_name2 ... ORDER BY key_part1 LIMIT row_count</CODE>
will use index on <CODE>key_part1</CODE> instead of <CODE>filesort</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug when doing
<CODE>LOCK TABLE to_table WRITE,...; INSERT INTO to_table... SELECT ...</CODE>
when <CODE>to_table</CODE> was empty.

<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.37" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.37">D.4.23  Changes in release 3.23.37 (17 Apr 2001)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fixed a bug when using <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> in <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause.
<LI>

Fixed a bug when using <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables with <CODE>LIKE</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--mysql-version</CODE> option to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
<LI>

Changed <CODE>INNOBASE</CODE> to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> (because the <CODE>INNOBASE</CODE>
name was already used). All <CODE>configure</CODE> options and <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
start options now use <CODE>innodb</CODE> instead of <CODE>innobase</CODE>. This
means that before upgrading to this version, you have to change any
configuration files where you have used <CODE>innobase</CODE> options!
<LI>

Fixed bug when using indexes on <CODE>CHAR(255) NULL</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Slave thread will now be started even if <CODE>master-host</CODE> is not set, as
long as <CODE>server-id</CODE> is set and valid <TT>`master.info'</TT> is present.
<LI>

Partial updates (terminated with kill) are now logged with a special error
code to the binary log. Slave will refuse to execute them if the error code
indicates the update was terminated abnormally, and will have to be recovered
with <CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START</CODE> after a manual sanity
check/correction of data integrity.
<LI>

Fixed bug that erroneously logged a drop of internal temporary table
on thread termination to the binary log -- this bug affected replication.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> on 64-bit machines.
<LI>

<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with <CODE>WHERE unique_key_part IS NULL</CODE>
didn't update/delete all rows.
<LI>

Disabled <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> for tables that support transactions.
<LI>

Fixed bug when using date functions on <CODE>TEXT</CODE>/<CODE>BLOB</CODE> column
with wrong date format.
<LI>

UDFs now also work on Windows. (Patch by Ralph Mason.)
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> that disabled
key-sorting. These commands should now be faster in most cases.
<LI>

Fixed performance bug where reopened tables (tables that had been
waiting for <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>) would not use indexes for the
next query.
<LI>

Fixed problem with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables on FreeBSD.
<LI>

Added <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variables <CODE>myisam_max_sort_file_size</CODE> and
<CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE>.
<LI>

Initialise signals early to avoid problem with signals in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<LI>

Applied patch for the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set to make comparisons
case-independent and to fix a bug in <CODE>LIKE</CODE> for this character set.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: All tables that uses the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set must be
fixed with  <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> !
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed a bug that allowed use of database names containing a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>
character.  This fixes a serious security issue when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is run
as root.
<LI>

Fixed bug when thread creation failed (could happen when doing a <STRONG>lot</STRONG>
of connections in a short time).
<LI>

Fixed some problems with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> and <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> tables.
(Problem with freeing the key cache and error <CODE>Can't reopen table...</CODE>.)
<LI>

Fixed a problem in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> with other character sets than <CODE>latin1</CODE>
and another problem when using many columns.
<LI>

Fixed bug that caused a core dump when using a very complex query involving
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> and summary functions.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...</CODE>
<LI>

Added <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug where the number of affected rows was not returned when MySQL
was compiled without transaction support.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> where keys weren't always used to find the
rows to be updated.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>CONCAT_WS()</CODE> where it returned incorrect results.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> to not
allow concurrent inserts as this could make the binary log hard to repeat.
(Concurrent inserts are enabled if you are not using the binary or update log.)
<LI>

Changed some macros to be able to use fast mutex with <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.2.

to the MySQL source distribution.
<LI>

<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> / <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> that could cause
a thread to hang.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> now only sets <CODE>CLIENT_TRANSACTIONS</CODE> in
<CODE>mysql-&#62;server_capabilities</CODE> if the server supports a
transaction-safe storage engine.

Improved error diagnostic for slave thread exit.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow space around <CODE>=</CODE> in argument to <CODE>--set-variable</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed problem in automatic repair that could leave some threads in state
<CODE>Waiting for table</CODE>.

<LI>

Removed warnings when running <CODE>REPAIR TABLE ... EXTENDED</CODE>.

<PRE>
SELECT a, DISTINCT SEC_TO_TIME(SUM(a))
FROM tbl_name GROUP BY a, b;
</PRE>

<LI>

Fixed buffer overrun in <CODE>libmysqlclient</CODE> library.
Fixed bug in handling <CODE>STOP</CODE> event after <CODE>ROTATE</CODE> event in

Fixed another buffer overrun in <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>Table_locks_immediate</CODE> and <CODE>Table_locks_waited</CODE> status
variables.

Fixed bug in replication that broke slave server start with existing
<TT>`master.info'</TT>. This fixes a bug introduced in 3.23.32.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=n</CODE> command to recover from
replication glitches without a full database copy.

Fixed creation of <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables on Windows.
<LI>

Portability fixes for OpenBSD and OS/2.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--temp-pool</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  Using this option
will cause most temporary files created to use a small set of names,
rather than a unique name for each new file.  This is to work around a
problem in the Linux kernel dealing with creating a bunch of new files
with different names.  With the old behaviour, Linux seems to "leak"
memory, as it's being allocated to the directory entry cache instead of
the disk cache.

<LI>

When creating a table, put <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> keys first, followed by
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> involving multi-part keys where one
specified all key parts both in the update and the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part. In
this case MySQL could try to update a record that didn't match
the whole <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part.
<LI>

Changed drop table to first drop the tables and then the <TT>`.frm'</TT> file.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the hostname cache which caused <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to report the
hostname as <CODE>''</CODE> in some error messages.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>HEAP</CODE> type tables; the variable
<CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE> wasn't used. Now either <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> or
<CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE> can be used to limit the size of a <CODE>HEAP</CODE>
type table.
<LI>

Changed the default server-id to 1 for masters and 2 for slaves
to make it easier to use the binary log.
<LI>

Renamed <CODE>bdb_lock_max</CODE> variable to <CODE>bdb_max_lock</CODE>.
<LI>

Added support for <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> on sub-fields for <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Added <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

In <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, we now store the number of rows; this helps to optimise
queries when we need an approximation of the number of rows.
<LI>

If we get an error in a multi-row statement, we now only roll back the
last statement, not the entire transaction.
<LI>

If you do a <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> when you have updated a non-transactional table
you will get an error as a warning.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--bdb-shared-data</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>Slave_open_temp_tables</CODE> status variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>

<LI>

<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>, and <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> have
been modified to use <CODE>mysql_print_defaults</CODE> instead of various hacks

Automatically remove Berkeley DB transaction logs that no longer are in
use.

<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES tbl_name</CODE> didn't always flush the index tree
to disk properly.
<LI>

<CODE>--bootstrap</CODE> is now run in a separate thread. This fixes a problem

Changed <CODE>mi_create()</CODE> to use less stack space.
<LI>

Fixed bug with optimiser trying to over-optimise <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> when used
with <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>crash-me</CODE> and the MySQL benchmarks to also work
with FrontBase.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>RESTRICT</CODE> and <CODE>CASCADE</CODE> after <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> to make
porting easier.

Reset status variable which could cause problem if one used <CODE>--slow-log</CODE>.
<LI>

<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.28" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.28">D.4.33  Changes in release 3.23.28 (22 Nov 2000: Gamma)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Added new options <CODE>--pager[=...]</CODE>, <CODE>--no-pager</CODE>,
<CODE>--tee=...</CODE> and <CODE>--no-tee</CODE> to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  The
new corresponding interactive commands are <CODE>pager</CODE>, <CODE>nopager</CODE>,
<CODE>tee</CODE> and <CODE>notee</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql">4.8.2  <CODE>mysql</CODE>, The Command-line Tool</A>, <CODE>mysql --help</CODE>
and the interactive help for more information.
<LI>

Fixed crash when automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table failed.
<LI>

Fixed a major performance bug in the table locking code when one
constantly had a lot of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements running. The symptom was that the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> queries were locked for a long time while new <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements were executed before the updates.
<LI>

When reading <CODE>options_files</CODE> with <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> the
<CODE>return-found-rows</CODE> option was ignored.
<LI>

One can now specify <CODE>interactive-timeout</CODE> in the option file that
is read by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>. This makes it possible to force
programs that run for a long time (like <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>) to use the
<CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE> time instead of the <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> time.
<LI>

Added to the slow query log the time and the user name for each logged
query. If you are using <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> then also queries that
do not use an index are logged, even if the query takes less than
<CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds.
<LI>

Fixed a problem in <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> which caused all columns in a reference
table to be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem when using <CODE>NATURAL JOIN</CODE> without keys.
<LI>

Fixed a bug when using a multi-part keys where the first part was of type
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>DROP</CODE> of temporary tables wasn't stored in the update/binary log.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT * ... LIMIT row_count</CODE> only returned one row.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the assembler code in <CODE>strstr()</CODE> for SPARC and cleaned up
the <TT>`global.h'</TT> header file to avoid a problem with bad aliasing with
the compiler submitted with Red Hat 7.0. (Reported by Trond Eivind Glomsr@o{}d)
<LI>

The <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option now works properly on NT.
<LI>

Fixed a long outstanding bug in the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables when a row with a length
of more than 65K was shortened by a single byte.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> when running multiple updating processes on
the same table.
<LI>

Allow one to use <CODE>FLUSH TABLE tbl_name</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--replicate-ignore-table</CODE>, <CODE>--replicate-do-table</CODE>,
<CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore-table</CODE>, and <CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table</CODE>
options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed all log files to use our own <CODE>IO_CACHE</CODE> mechanism instead of
<CODE>FILE</CODE> to avoid OS problems when there are many files open.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--open-files</CODE> and <CODE>--timezone</CODE> options to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a fatal bug in <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Added variables <CODE>large_file_support</CODE>,<CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE>,
<CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE> and <CODE>query_buffer_size</CODE> to <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

Added status variables <CODE>created_tmp_files</CODE> and <CODE>sort_merge_passes</CODE>
to <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where we didn't allow an index name after the
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> definition.
<LI>

Added <CODE>TRUNCATE table_name</CODE> as a synonym for
<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> key compare function when comparing part keys.
<LI>

Added <CODE>bdb_lock_max</CODE> variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added more tests to the benchmark suite.
<LI>

Fixed an overflow bug in the client code when using overly long database names.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> now aborts on Linux if the server doesn't answer in
<CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds.
<LI>

<CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> did not work if you started with
<CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> and had not explicitly run <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed the output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> to be consistent with
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. (It now has no directory in the log name.)
<LI>

Added <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--safemalloc-mem-limit</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to simulate memory
shortage when compiled with the <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> option.
<LI>

Fixed several core dumps in out-of-memory conditions.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> was using an uninitialised mutex if the slave had
not been started yet.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ELT()</CODE> and <CODE>MAKE_SET()</CODE> when the query used
a temporary table.
<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> without specifying <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE> would
set it to 0 instead of 4 and hit the magic number in the master binlog.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY ...</CODE> syntax added.  This will create the
new table with the rows in a specific order.

Fixed <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE> to work properly with <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>SUBSTRING_INDEX()</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE()</CODE>.
(Patch by Alexander Igonitchev)
<LI>

Fix <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> not to produce an error
if the table exists.
<LI>

If you don't create a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, a hidden
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> will be created.
<LI>

Added read-only-key optimisation to <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

<CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> in some cases preferred a full table scan when there was
no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
<LI>

When using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, don't count the time waiting for a lock.
<LI>

Fixed bug in lock code on Windows which could cause the key cache
to report that the key file was crashed even if it was okay.
<LI>

Automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables if you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed the <CODE>TYPE=</CODE> keyword from <CODE>CHECK</CODE> and
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>. Allow <CODE>CHECK</CODE> options to be combined. (You can still
use <CODE>TYPE=</CODE>, but this usage is deprecated.)
<LI>

Fixed mutex bug in the binary replication log -- long update queries could
be read only in part by the slave if it did it at the wrong time, which
was not fatal, but resulted in a performance-degrading reconnect and
a scary message in the error log.
<LI>

Changed the format of the binary log -- added magic number, server
version, binlog version. Added the server ID and query error code for each
query event.
<LI>

Replication thread from the slave now will kill all the stale threads
from the same server.
<LI>

Long replication user names were not being handled properly.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--replicate-rewrite-db</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Updates that generated an error code (such as <CODE>INSERT INTO foo(some_key)
values (1),(1)</CODE>) erroneously terminated the slave thread.
<LI>

Added optimisation of queries where <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is only used on columns
from some of the tables.
<LI>

Allow floating-point numbers where there is no sign after the exponent
(like <CODE>1e1</CODE>).
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> didn't always show all column grants.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--default-extra-file=#</CODE> option to all MySQL clients.
<LI>

Columns referenced in <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements now are initialised properly.
<LI>

<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> didn't always work when used with a range on a timestamp that
was part of the key that was used to find rows.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index when inserting a <CODE>NULL</CODE> column.
<LI>

Changed to use <CODE>mkstemp()</CODE> instead of <CODE>tempnam()</CODE>. Based
on a patch from John Jones.

<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.25" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.25">D.4.36  Changes in release 3.23.25 (29 Sep 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>databasename</CODE> works as second argument to <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>.
<LI>

The values for the <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> environment variables
now can be specified in octal by beginning the value with a zero.
<LI>

Added <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE>. This makes <CODE>RIGHT</CODE> a reserved word.
<LI>

Added <CODE>@@IDENTITY</CODE> as a synonym for <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.
(This is for MSSQL compatibility.)
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> when using <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>
index.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> now works with FIFOs.
(Patch by Toni L. Harbaugh-Blackford.)
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> broke replication if you specified a log name with an
explicit extension as the value of the <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> with packed multi-part keys.
<LI>

Fixed crash when using <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> on Windows.

Fixed some mutex bugs in the log code that could cause thread blocks if new
log files couldn't be created.
<LI>

Added lock time and number of selected processed rows to slow query log.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--memlock</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to lock <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
in memory on systems with the <CODE>mlockall()</CODE> call (as in Solaris).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables didn't use keys properly. (Bug from 3.23.23.)

Added better support for <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables (keys, mapping, creation,
documentation...). See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.

Fixed bug in <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> from 3.23 which caused some <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns
not to be quoted.

Merged <CODE>analyze</CODE>, <CODE>check</CODE>, <CODE>optimize</CODE> and repair code.
<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is now mapped to <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> with statistics and

<UL>
<LI>

Added <CODE>created_tmp_disk_tables</CODE> variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

To make it possible to reliably dump and restore tables with
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> columns, MySQL now reports columns with <CODE>X</CODE>
other than 14 or 8 to be strings.
<LI>

Changed sort order for <CODE>latin1</CODE> as it was before MySQL Version 3.23.23.
Any table that was created or modified with 3.23.22 must be repaired if it has
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns that may contain characters with ASCII values greater than
128!
<LI>

Fixed small memory leak introduced from 3.23.22 when creating a
temporary table.

<UL>
<LI>

Changed sort order for 'German'; all tables created with 'German' sortorder
must be repaired with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> before use!
<LI>

Added <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to get a core file on
Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies on the <CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE> signal.
<LI>

MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE> now starts with option
<CODE>--no-named-commands</CODE> (<CODE>-g</CODE>) by default. This option can be
disabled with <CODE>--enable-named-commands</CODE> (<CODE>-G</CODE>). This may cause
incompatibility problems in some cases, for example, in SQL scripts that
use named commands without a semicolon, etc.!  Long format commands
still work from the first line.
<LI>

Fixed a problem when using many pending <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> statements at
the same time.
<LI>

Optimiser didn't use keys properly when using <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> on an
empty table.

Added shorter help text when invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with incorrect options.
<LI>

Fixed non-fatal <CODE>free()</CODE> bug in <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>.

Fixed bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> index handling of
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>/<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> keys.

Fixed a bug in concurrent insert in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.  In some contexts,
usage of <CODE>MIN(key_part)</CODE> or <CODE>MAX(key_part)</CODE> returned an empty set.
<LI>

Updated <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> to use the new <CODE>FLUSH TABLES table_list</CODE>
syntax. Only tables which are being backed up are flushed now.
<LI>

Changed behaviour of <CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE> so
that both non-threaded (<CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE>) and threaded
(<CODE>-lmysqlclient_r</CODE>) libraries are built.  Users who linked
against a threaded <CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE> will need to link against
<CODE>-lmysqlclient_r</CODE> now.
<LI>

Added atomic <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> command.
<LI>

Don't count <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on empty tables and
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ...</CODE> on empty tables to create non-unique indexes
in a separate batch with sorting. This will make the above calls much
faster when you have many indexes.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> now logs the first used insert_id correctly.
<LI>

Fixed crash when adding a default value to a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>DATE_ADD/DATE_SUB</CODE> where it returned a datetime instead
of a date.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with the thread cache which made some threads show up as
<CODE>***DEAD***</CODE> in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a lock in our thr_rwlock code, which could make selects that run
at the same time as concurrent inserts crash. This only affects systems
that don't have the <CODE>pthread_rwlock_rdlock</CODE> code.

When deleting rows with a non-unique key in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table, all rows
weren't always deleted.

<LI>

<CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> now updates key statistics for the table.
<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> will now only update tables that have been changed
since the last <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>. Note that this is a new feature and tables
will not be marked to be analysed until they are updated in any way with
3.23.23 or newer.  For older tables, you have to do <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
to update the key distribution.
<LI>

Fixed some minor privilege problems with <CODE>CHECK</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> and <CODE>SHOW CREATE</CODE> commands.

<CODE>--check-only-changed</CODE> are also honored with <CODE>--sort-index</CODE> and
<CODE>--analyze</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed fatal bug in <CODE>LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER</CODE> that did not lock the
table during index re-build.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> broke replication if the database was excluded
from replication.
<LI>

More variables in <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> and <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE> now will not return until the slave thread actually exits.
<LI>

Full-text search via the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function and <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index type
(for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> files).  This makes <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> a reserved word.

Added the <CODE>slow_launch_time</CODE> variable and the <CODE>Slow_launch_threads</CODE>
status variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  These can be examined with

Added optimisation to skip <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> parts where the part is a
constant expression in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part.  Indexes can now be used
even if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> doesn't match the index exactly, as long as

Fixed a critical bug in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, where it updated the header in
the index file when one only checked the table.  This confused the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon if it updated the same table at the same time. Now
the status in the index file is only updated if one uses
<CODE>--update-state</CODE>.  With older <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> versions you should
use <CODE>--read-only</CODE> when only checking tables, if there is the

LOTS of patches for Linux Alpha. MySQL now appears to be relatively
stable on Alpha.

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed range optimiser bug: <CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE
key_part1 &#62;= const AND (key_part2 = const OR key_part2 = const)</CODE>.  The
bug was that some rows could be duplicated in the result.

<UL>
<LI>

A new storage engine library (<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>) with a lot of new features.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.
<LI>

You can create in-memory <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables which are extremely fast for
lookups.
<LI>

Support for big files (63-bit) on OSs that support big files.
<LI>

New function <CODE>LOAD_FILE(filename)</CODE> to get the contents of a file as a
string value.
<LI>

New operator <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> which will act as <CODE>=</CODE> but will return TRUE
if both arguments are <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  This is useful for comparing changes
between tables.
<LI>

Added the ODBC 3.0 <CODE>EXTRACT(interval FROM datetime)</CODE> function.
<LI>

Columns defined as <CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> are not rounded on storage and may be
in scientific notation (1.0 E+10) when retrieved.
<LI>

<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> is now faster than before.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>LIKE</CODE> character comparison to behave as <CODE>=</CODE>;
This means that <CODE>'e' LIKE ''</CODE> is now true.  (If the line doesn't
display correctly, the latter 'e' is a French 'e' with a dot above.)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> returns a lot of information about the tables.
<LI>

Added <CODE>LIKE</CODE> to the <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE> command.

<CODE>CREATE TABLE table_name (col INT not null UNIQUE)</CODE>
<LI>

New create syntax: <CODE>CREATE TABLE table_name SELECT ...</CODE>
<LI>

New create syntax: <CODE>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...</CODE>
<LI>

Allow creation of <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> columns.
<LI>

<CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> now requires <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> before any format character.
<LI>

<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> is now a reserved word (sorry about that :( ).
<LI>

An example procedure is added: <CODE>analyse</CODE>, file: <TT>`sql_analyse.c'</TT>.
This will describe the data in your query.  Try the following:

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM ...
WHERE ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE([max elements,[max memory]])
</PRE>

This procedure is extremely useful when you want to check the data in your
table!
<LI>

<CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast to force a string to be compared in case-sensitive fashion.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Check whether a row has changed in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> now also works
with <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Added the <CODE>INNER</CODE> join syntax.  <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:  This made <CODE>INNER</CODE>
a reserved word!
<LI>

Added support for netmasks to the hostname in the MySQL grant tables.
You can specify a netmask using the <CODE>IP/NETMASK</CODE> syntax.
<LI>

If you compare a <CODE>NOT NULL DATE/DATETIME</CODE> column with <CODE>IS
NULL</CODE>, this is changed to a compare against <CODE>0</CODE> to satisfy some ODBC
applications.  (By <a HREF="mailto:shreeve@uci.edu">shreeve@uci.edu</a>.)
<LI>

<CODE>NULL IN (...)</CODE> now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of <CODE>0</CODE>.  This will
ensure that <CODE>null_column NOT IN (...)</CODE> doesn't match
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Fix storage of floating-point values in <CODE>TIME</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Changed parsing of <CODE>TIME</CODE> strings to be more strict.  Now the
fractional second part is detected (and currently skipped). The
following formats are supported:

<UL>
<LI>[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]

<LI>[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]

</UL>

<LI>

Detect (and ignore) fractional second part from <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>.
<LI>

Added the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

The default index name now uses the same case as the column name on which the
index name is based.
<LI>

Changed default number of connections to 100.
<LI>

Use bigger buffers when using <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>DECIMAL(x,y)</CODE> now works according to SQL-99.

(<a HREF="mailto:bobak@relog.ch">bobak@relog.ch</a>) for this!
<LI>

<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> is now updated for <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</CODE>.
<LI>

Some small changes to the join table optimiser to make some joins faster.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> is much faster; it uses the new <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
functionality in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. One difference compared to MySQL Version 3.22
is that the output of <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is no longer sorted.
<LI>

All C client API macros are now functions to make shared libraries more
reliable. Because of this, you can no longer call <CODE>mysql_num_fields()</CODE> on
a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> object, you must use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> instead.
<LI>

Added use of <CODE>LIBWRAP</CODE>; patch by Henning P. Schmiedehausen.
<LI>

Don't allow <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> for other than numerical columns.
<LI>

Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> will now automatically make the column
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Show <CODE>NULL</CODE> as the default value for <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SQL_BIG_RESULT</CODE>; <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE> is now default.
<LI>

Added a shared library RPM. This enhancement was contributed by David
Fox (<a HREF="mailto:dsfox@cogsci.ucsd.edu">dsfox@cogsci.ucsd.edu</a>).
<LI>

Added  <CODE>--enable-large-files</CODE> and <CODE>--disable-large-files</CODE> switches
to <CODE>configure</CODE>. See <TT>`configure.in'</TT> for some systems where this is
automatically turned off because of broken implementations.
<LI>

Upgraded <CODE>readline</CODE> to 4.0.
<LI>

New <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> options: <CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE> and <CODE>CHECKSUM</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--default-table-type</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

The 3.22 version has faster and safer connect code than version 3.21, as well

inside the comments as if the surrounding <CODE>/*!</CODE> and <CODE>*/</CODE> comment
characters didn't exist.
<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name</CODE> can now be used to reclaim disk space
after many deletes.  Currently, this uses <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
regenerate the table, but in the future it will use an integrated
<CODE>isamchk</CODE> for more speed.

Upgraded <CODE>libtool</CODE> to get the configure more portable.
<LI>

Fixed slow <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> operations when using

<LI>

Changed optimiser to make it better at deciding when to do a full join

<LI>

You can now use <CODE>mysqladmin proc</CODE> to display information about your own
threads. Only users with the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege can get
information about all threads.
(In 4.0.2 one needs the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege for this.)
<LI>

Added handling of formats <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>, <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>,
<CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> for numbers when using <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> and

Changed locking code to get better handling of locks of different types.
<LI>

Updated <CODE>DBI</CODE> to 1.00 and <CODE>DBD</CODE> to 1.2.0.
<LI>

Added a check that the error message file contains error messages suitable for
the current version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. (To avoid errors if you accidentally
try to use an old error message file.)
<LI>

All count structures in the client (<CODE>affected_rows()</CODE>,
<CODE>insert_id()</CODE>, ...) are now of type <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> to allow 64-bit values
to be used.
This required a minor change in the MySQL protocol which should affect
only old clients when using tables with <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> values &#62; 16M.
<LI>

The return type of <CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE> has changed from <CODE>uint *</CODE>
to <CODE>ulong *</CODE>. This may give a warning for old clients but should work
on most machines.
<LI>

Change <CODE>mysys</CODE> and <CODE>dbug</CODE> libraries to allocate all thread variables
in one struct.  This makes it easier to make a threaded <TT>`libmysql.dll'</TT>
library.
<LI>

Use the result from <CODE>gethostname()</CODE> (instead of <CODE>uname()</CODE>) when
constructing <TT>`.pid'</TT> file names.

Increased the default value of <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to <CODE>1M</CODE> in
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to give
table-modifying operations (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>) lower priority than retrievals.  You can now use
<CODE>{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...</CODE> You can
also use <CODE>SET SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES={0|1}</CODE> to change
the priority for one thread.  One side effect is that <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>
is now a reserved word. :(
<LI>

Add support for <CODE>INSERT INTO table ... VALUES(...),(...),(...)</CODE>,
to allow inserting multiple rows with a single statement.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO tbl_name</CODE> is now also cached when used with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.
(Previously only <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> were
cached.)

Allow <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> functions with <CODE>HAVING</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col FROM table GROUP BY col HAVING COUNT(*)&#62;0;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will now ignore trailing <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> characters in queries. This
is to make it easier to migrate from some other SQL servers that require the
trailing <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>.
<LI>

Fix for corrupted fixed-format output generated by <CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

<STRONG>Warning: incompatible change!</STRONG>
Added Oracle <CODE>GREATEST()</CODE> and <CODE>LEAST()</CODE> functions.  You must now use
these instead of the <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and <CODE>MIN()</CODE> functions to get the
largest/smallest value from a list of values. These can now handle <CODE>REAL</CODE>,
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> and string (<CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>) values.

<UL>
<LI>

Added new C API function <CODE>mysql_ping()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new API functions <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.
You now MUST call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> before you call
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.
You don't have to call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> if you only use
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>.

<CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns were compared in binary (case-sensitive)

<H3><A NAME="News-3.22.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.22.0">D.5.36  Changes in release 3.22.0</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

New (backward-compatible) connect protocol that allows you to
specify the database to use when connecting, to get much faster
connections to a specific database.

The <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> call is changed to:


<PRE>
mysql_real_connect(MYSQL *mysql, const char *host, const char *user,
                   const char *passwd, const char *db, uint port,
                   const char *unix_socket, uint client_flag)
</PRE>

<LI>

Each connection is handled by its own thread, rather than by the
master <CODE>accept()</CODE> thread.  This fixes permanently the telnet bug
that was a topic on the mail list some time ago.
<LI>

All TCP/IP connections are now checked with backward-resolution of
the hostname to get better security. <CODE>mysqld</CODE> now has a local hostname
resolver cache so connections should actually be faster than before,
even with this feature.
<LI>

A site automatically will be blocked from future connections if someone
repeatedly connects with an ``improper header'' (like when one uses telnet).
<LI>

You can now refer to tables in different databases with references of the form
<CODE>tbl_name@db_name</CODE> or <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE>.  This makes it possible to
give a user read access to some tables and write access to others simply by
keeping them in different databases!
<LI>

Added <CODE>--user</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to allow it to run
as another Unix user (if it is started as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user).
<LI>

Added caching of users and access rights (for faster access rights checking)
<LI>

Normal users (not anonymous ones) can change their password with
<CODE>mysqladmin password 'new_password'</CODE>.  This uses encrypted passwords
that are not logged in the normal MySQL log!
<LI>

All important string functions are now coded in assembler for x86 Linux
machines.  This gives a speedup of 10% in many cases.
<LI>

For tables that have many columns, the column names are now hashed for
much faster column name lookup (this will speed up some benchmark
tests a lot!)
<LI>

Some benchmarks are changed to get better individual timing.
(Some loops were so short that a specific test took &#60; 2 seconds. The
loops have been changed to take about 20 seconds to make it easier
to compare different databases. A test that took 1-2 seconds before
now takes 11-24 seconds, which is much better)
<LI>

Re-arranged <CODE>SELECT</CODE> code to handle some very specific queries
involving group functions (like <CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE>) without a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> but
with <CODE>HAVING</CODE>. The following now works:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) as C FROM table HAVING C &#62; 1;
</PRE>

<LI>

Changed the protocol for field functions to be faster and avoid some
calls to <CODE>malloc()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-T32</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, for running all queries under the
main thread.  This makes it possible to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> under Linux with
<CODE>gdb</CODE>!
<LI>

Added optimisation of <CODE>not_null_column IS NULL</CODE> (needed for some Access
queries).
<LI>

Allow <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> to be used between two tables to force the optimiser
to join them in a specific order.
<LI>

String functions now return <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> rather than <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and
the column type is now <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> for fields saved as <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>.
This should make the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver better, but may break some old
MySQL clients that don't handle <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_VARCHAR</CODE> the same
way as <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> are now implemented through
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> is still the recommended (fast) way to create indexes.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> option <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added time column to <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> to show how long a query
has taken or how long a thread has slept.
<LI>

Added lots of new variables to <CODE>show variables</CODE> and some new to
<CODE>show status</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new type <CODE>YEAR</CODE>. <CODE>YEAR</CODE> is stored in 1 byte with allowable
values of 0, and 1901 to 2155.
<LI>

Added new <CODE>DATE</CODE> type that is stored in 3 bytes rather than 4 bytes.
All new tables are created with the new date type if you don't use the
<CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in record caches; for some queries, you could get
<CODE>Error from table handler: #</CODE> on some operating systems.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--enable-assembler</CODE> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>, for x86 machines
(tested on Linux + <CODE>gcc</CODE>).  This will enable assembler functions for the
most important string functions for more speed!

Sorting on calculated <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> values sorted on integer results instead.

<CODE>mysql</CODE> no longer requires a database argument.
<LI>

Changed the place where <CODE>HAVING</CODE> should be. According to the SQL standards, it should
be after <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> but before <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>. MySQL Version 3.20
incorrectly had it last.
<LI>

Added Sybase command <CODE>USE database</CODE> to start using another database.
<LI>

Added automatic adjusting of number of connections and table cache size
if the maximum number of files that can be opened is less than needed.
This should fix that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't crash even if you haven't done a

destroy the <TT>`.ISM'</TT> files on (Free)BSD 2.x systems.
<LI>

Fixed broken <CODE>__P_</CODE> patch in MIT-pthreads.
<LI>

Many memory overrun checks. All string functions now return <CODE>NULL</CODE>
if the returned string should be longer than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.
<LI>

Changed the name of the <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> type to <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, because
<CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> is used in SQL-99.
<LI>

In some cases, doing a <CODE>JOIN</CODE> + <CODE>GROUP</CODE> + <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE>,
the result wasn't grouped.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> now allows IP number and hostname for the <CODE>--bind-address</CODE>

Added <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET cp1251_koi8</CODE> to enable conversions of
data to and from the <CODE>cp1251_koi8</CODE> character set.
<LI>

Lots of changes for Windows 95 port. In theory, this version should now be
easily portable to Windows 95.
<LI>

Changed the <CODE>CREATE COLUMN</CODE> syntax of <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> columns to be after
the <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value, as specified in the SQL-99 standard. This will
make <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> with <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> and default values incompatible with
MySQL Version 3.20.
<LI>

Added many function name aliases so the functions can be used with
ODBC or SQL-92 syntax.
<LI>

Fixed syntax of <CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name ALTER COLUMN col_name SET DEFAULT
NULL</CODE>.

Added <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>BIT</CODE> as synonyms for <CODE>CHAR(1)</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed core dump when updating as a user who has only <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ... GROUP BY</CODE> didn't work in some cases. An
<CODE>Invalid use of group function</CODE> error occurred.
<LI>

When using <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT</CODE> now always uses keys instead of record
scan.  This will give better performance on <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
that matches many rows.
<LI>

<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with <CODE>NULL</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Added function <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> SQL function to retrieve last
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
value.  This is intended for clients to ODBC that can't use the
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> API function, but can be used by any client.

<LI>

Added text types <CODE>TINYTEXT</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMTEXT</CODE> and
<CODE>LONGTEXT</CODE>.  These are actually <CODE>BLOB</CODE>types, but all searching is
done in case-insensitive fashion.

All old <CODE>BLOB</CODE> fields are now <CODE>TEXT</CODE> fields.  This only

<LI>

Fixed some <CODE>configure</CODE> issues.

<LI>

Fixed some possible buffer overflows if filenames that are too long are used.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't accept hostnames that start with digits followed by a
<CODE>'.'</CODE>, because the hostname may look like an IP number.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to allow only socket

examined records. The default is ``unlimited''.
<LI>

When comparing a <CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column to a constant, the constant is converted to a time value before
performing the comparison.
This will make it easier to get ODBC (particularly Access97) to work with

New <CODE>isamchk</CODE> which can detect and fix more problems.
<LI>

New options for <CODE>isamlog</CODE>.
<LI>

Using new version of Automake.
<LI>

Many small portability changes (from the AIX and alpha-digital port)
Better checking of pthread(s) library.
<LI>

czech error messages by <a HREF="mailto:snajdr@pvt.net">snajdr@pvt.net</a>.
<LI>

Decreased size of some buffers to get fewer problems on systems with little
memory.  Also added more checks to handle ``out of memory'' problems.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>: you can now do <CODE>mysqladmin kill 5,6,7,8</CODE> to kill
multiple threads.
<LI>

When the maximum connection limit is reached, one extra connection by a user
with the <STRONG>process_acl</STRONG> privilege is granted.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-O backlog=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Increased maximum packet size from 512K to 1024K for client.
<LI>

Almost all of the function code is now tested in the internal test suite.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> now returns warnings from field conversions.
<LI>

Port changed to 3306 (got it reserved from ISI).
<LI>

Added a fix for Visual FoxBase so that any schema name from a table
specification is automatically removed.
<LI>

New function <CODE>ASCII()</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed function <CODE>BETWEEN(a,b,c)</CODE>. Use the standard SQL
syntax instead: <CODE>expr BETWEEN expr AND expr</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL no longer has to use an extra temporary table when sorting
on functions or <CODE>SUM()</CODE> functions.
<LI>

Fixed bug that you couldn't use <CODE>tbl_name.field_name</CODE> in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> when using 'hidden group'. For example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DISTINCT MOD(some_field,10) FROM test
    -&#62;        GROUP BY some_field;
</PRE>

Note: <CODE>some_field</CODE> is normally in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part. Standard SQL should
require it.

<UL>
<LI>

New reserved words used: <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, <CODE>READ</CODE>,
<CODE>WRITE</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>.
<LI>

Added ODBC function <CODE>CHAR(num,...)</CODE>.
<LI>

New operator <CODE>IN</CODE>. This uses a binary search to find a match.
<LI>

New command <CODE>LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ|WRITE} ...</CODE>
<LI>

Added <CODE>--log-update</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to get a log suitable for
incremental updates.
<LI>

New command <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE> to get information about how the
optimiser will do the join.
<LI>

For easier client code, the client should no longer use
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY_BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_MEDIUM_BLOB</CODE>,
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_LONG_BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING</CODE> (as
previously returned by <CODE>mysql_list_fields</CODE>).  You should instead only use
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_STRING</CODE>.  If you want exact
types, you should use the command <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added varbinary syntax: <CODE>0x######</CODE> which can be used as a string
(default) or a number.
<LI>

<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> is renamed to <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed all fields to C++ classes.
<LI>

Removed FORM struct.
<LI>

Fields with <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values no longer need to be <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

New field types:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ENUM</CODE>
<DD>
A string which can take only a couple of defined values. The value is
stored as a 1-3 byte number that is mapped automatically to a string.
This is sorted according to string positions!
<DT><CODE>SET</CODE>
<DD>
A string which may have one or many string values separated with ','.
The string is stored as a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 8-byte number where each bit stands
for a specific set member.  This is sorted according to the unsigned value
of the stored packed number.
</DL>
<LI>

Now all function calculation is done with <CODE>double</CODE> or <CODE>long long</CODE>.
This will provide the full 64-bit range with bit functions and fix some
conversions that previously could result in precision losses.  One should
avoid using <CODE>unsigned long long</CODE> columns with full 64-bit range
(numbers bigger than 9223372036854775807) because calculations are done
with <CODE>signed long long</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will now put <CODE>NULL</CODE> field values first. <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
will also work with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Full <CODE>WHERE</CODE> with expressions.
<LI>

New range optimiser that can resolve ranges when some keypart prefix is
constant. Example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;          WHERE key_part_1="customer"
    -&#62;          AND key_part_2&#62;=10 AND key_part_2&#60;=10;

Added <CODE>-p#</CODE> (remove <CODE>#</CODE> directories from path) to <CODE>isamlog</CODE>.
All files are written with a relative path from the database directory
Now <CODE>mysqld</CODE> shouldn't crash on shutdown when using the
<CODE>--log-isam</CODE> option.
<LI>

New <CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> version. It is now compatible with <CODE>msqlperl-0.63</CODE>.
<LI>

New <CODE>DBD</CODE> module available.
<LI>

Added group function <CODE>STD()</CODE> (standard deviation).
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is now compiled by default without debugging
information.  This will make the daemon smaller and faster.
<LI>

Now one usually only has to specify the <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. All other paths are relative in a normal installation.
<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns sometimes contained garbage when used with a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
on more than one table and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed that calculations that are not in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> work as expected
(SQL-99 extension).
Example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,id+1 FROM table GROUP BY id;
</PRE>

<LI>

The test of using <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> was reversed. Now <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> is
enabled as default in the default release.
<LI>

Fixed conversion bug which caused <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to core dump with
Arithmetic error on SPARC-386.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--unbuffered</CODE> option to <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for new <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.
<LI>

When using overlapping (unnecessary) keys and join over many tables,
the optimiser could get confused and return 0 records.

You can now use <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns and the functions <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and
<CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
<LI>

All communication packets and row buffers are now allocated dynamically
on demand. The default value of <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is now 64K for
the server and 512K for the client. This is mainly used to catch
incorrect packets that could trash all memory. The server limit may be
changed when it is started.
<LI>

Changed stack usage to use less memory.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to check for running daemon.
<LI>

The <CODE>ELT()</CODE> function is renamed to <CODE>FIELD()</CODE>.  The new
<CODE>ELT()</CODE> function returns a value based on an index: <CODE>FIELD()</CODE>
is the inverse of <CODE>ELT()</CODE> Example: <CODE>ELT(2,"A","B","C")</CODE> returns
<CODE>"B"</CODE>. <CODE>FIELD("B","A","B","C")</CODE> returns <CODE>2</CODE>.

<CODE>COUNT(field)</CODE>, where <CODE>field</CODE> could have a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value, now
works.

Fixed memory overrun bug in <CODE>WHERE</CODE> with many unoptimisable brace levels.
<LI>

Fixed some small bugs in the grant code.

If hostname isn't found by <CODE>get_hostname</CODE>, only the IP is checked.
Previously, you got <CODE>Access denied</CODE>.
<LI>

Inserts of timestamps with values didn't always work.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... WHERE</CODE> could give the error
<CODE>Duplicated field</CODE>.

Changed <CODE>sql_lex</CODE> to handle <CODE>\0</CODE> unquoted, but the client can't send
the query through the C API, because it takes a str pointer.
You must use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE> to send the query.

You can have <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expressions and table columns in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>

lookups.  The column that is used should be a constant for each group because
the value is calculated only once for the first row that is found for a group.

<LI>

Made <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS</CODE> a synonym for <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>.
Added compatibility syntax <CODE>FRIEND KEY</CODE> to <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. In
MySQL, this creates a non-unique key on the given columns.
<LI>

Added <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> as compatibility functions.
In MySQL, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> only checks if the index exists and
issues an error if it doesn't exist. <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> always succeeds.
<LI>

<TT>`mysqladmin.c'</TT>: added client version to version information.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>sql_acl</CODE> (core on new connection).
<LI>

Removed <CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>db</CODE> tables from database <CODE>test</CODE>
in the distribution.
<LI>

<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> can now be signed (-128 to 127) or unsigned (0 to 255)
Previously, it was always unsigned.
<LI>

Bug fixes in <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> and <CODE>WEEKDAY()</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed a lot of source to get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be compiled with SunPro
compiler.
<LI>

SQL functions must now have a <CODE>'('</CODE> immediately after the function name
(no intervening space).
For example, <CODE>'USER('</CODE> is regarded as beginning a function call, and
<CODE>'USER ('</CODE> is regarded as an identifier <CODE>USER</CODE> followed by a
<CODE>'('</CODE>, not as a function call.

The source distribution is done with <CODE>configure</CODE> and Automake.
It will make porting much easier.  The <CODE>readline</CODE> library is included
in the distribution.
<LI>

Separate client compilation:
the client code should be very easy to compile on systems which
don't have threads.
<LI>

The old Perl interface code is automatically compiled and installed.
Automatic compiling of <CODE>DBD</CODE> will follow when the new <CODE>DBD</CODE> code
is ported.
<LI>

Dynamic language support: <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can now be started with Swedish
or English (default) error messages.
<LI>

New functions: <CODE>INSERT()</CODE>, <CODE>RTRIM()</CODE>, <CODE>LTRIM()</CODE> and
<CODE>FORMAT()</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> now works correctly for all field types (even
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>). The format for <CODE>SHOW FIELDS FROM tbl_name</CODE>
is changed so the <CODE>Type</CODE> column contains information suitable for
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.  In previous releases, some <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
information had to be patched when re-creating tables.
<LI>

Some parser bugs from 3.19.5 (<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>) are corrected.
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> now returns different date information depending on its
create length.
<LI>

Changed parser to allow a database, table or field name to
start with a number or <CODE>'_'</CODE>.
<LI>

All old C code from Unireg changed to C++ and cleaned up. This makes
the daemon a little smaller and easier to understand.
<LI>

A lot of small bug fixes done.

This appendix will help you port MySQL to other operating systems.
Do check the list of currently supported operating systems first.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.
If you have created a new port of MySQL, please let us know so that
we can list it here and on our web site (<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>),
recommending it to other users.

</P>
<P>
Note: If you create a new port of MySQL, you are free to copy and
distribute it under the <CODE>GPL</CODE> license, but it does not make you a
copyright holder of MySQL.

A working Posix thread library is needed for the server. On Solaris 2.5
we use Sun PThreads (the native thread support in 2.4 and earlier
versions is not good enough), on Linux we use LinuxThreads by Xavier
Leroy, <a HREF="mailto:Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr">Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr</a>.

</P>
<P>
The hard part of porting to a new Unix variant without good native
thread support is probably to port MIT-pthreads. See
<TT>`mit-pthreads/README'</TT> and Programming POSIX Threads
(<a HREF="http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/">http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/</a>).

</P>
<P>
Up to MySQL 4.0.2, the MySQL distribution included a patched version of
Chris Provenzano's Pthreads from MIT (see the MIT Pthreads web page at
<a HREF="http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/pthreads/">http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/pthreads/</a> and a programming
introduction at <a HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/IAP_2000/">http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/IAP_2000/</a>).
These can be used for some operating systems that do not have POSIX threads.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to use another user level thread package named
FSU Pthreads (see <a HREF="http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/pthreads/">http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/pthreads/</a>).
This implementation is being used for the SCO port.

Both the server and the client need a working C++ compiler. We use <CODE>gcc</CODE>
on many platforms. Other compilers that are known to work are SPARCworks,
Sun Forte, Irix <CODE>cc</CODE>, HP-UX <CODE>aCC</CODE>, IBM AIX <CODE>xlC_r</CODE>), Intel

If you run into problems with a new port, you may have to do some debugging
of MySQL!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: before you start debugging <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, first get the test
programs <CODE>mysys/thr_alarm</CODE> and <CODE>mysys/thr_lock</CODE> to work.  This

If you are using some functionality that is very new in MySQL,
you can try to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> (which will disable all
new, potentially unsafe functionality) or with <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE> which
disables a lot of optimisation that may cause problems.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't want to start, you should check that you don't have
any <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> files that interfere with your setup!
You can check your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> arguments with <CODE>mysqld --print-defaults</CODE>
and avoid using them by starting with <CODE>mysqld --no-defaults ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts to eat up CPU or memory or if it ``hangs'', you
can use <CODE>mysqladmin processlist status</CODE> to find out if someone is
executing a query that takes a long time.  It may be a good idea to
run <CODE>mysqladmin -i10 processlist status</CODE> in some window if you are
experiencing performance problems or problems when new clients can't connect.

</P>
<P>
The command <CODE>mysqladmin debug</CODE> will dump some information about
locks in use, used memory and query usage to the mysql log file. This
may help solve some problems.  This command also provides some useful
information even if you haven't compiled MySQL for debugging!

</P>
<P>
If the problem is that some tables are getting slower and slower you
should try to optimise the table with <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> or
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>. You should also
check the slow queries with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should also read the OS-specific section in this manual for
problems that may be unique to your environment.

<H3><A NAME="Compiling_for_debugging" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compiling_for_debugging">E.1.1  Compiling MYSQL for Debugging</A></H3>

<P>
If you have some very specific problem, you can always try to debug
MySQL.  To do this you must configure MySQL with the
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE> or the <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> option.  You can check
whether MySQL was compiled with debugging by doing:
<CODE>mysqld --help</CODE>.  If the <CODE>--debug</CODE> flag is listed with the
options then you have debugging enabled.  <CODE>mysqladmin ver</CODE> also
lists the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version as <CODE>mysql ... --debug</CODE> in this case.

</P>
<P>
If you are using gcc or egcs, the recommended configure line is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -felide-constructors \
   -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
   --with-debug --with-extra-charsets=complex
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> library and with C++
exceptions (many compilers have problems with C++ exceptions in threaded
code) and compile a MySQL version with support for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
If you suspect a memory overrun error, you can configure MySQL
with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, which will install a memory allocation
(<CODE>SAFEMALLOC</CODE>) checker. However, running with <CODE>SAFEMALLOC</CODE> is
quite slow, so if you get performance problems you should start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> option. This will
disable the memory overrun checks for each call to <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and
<CODE>free()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> stops crashing when you compile it with
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, you have probably found a compiler bug or a timing
bug within MySQL.  In this case you can try to add <CODE>-g</CODE> to
the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> variables above and not use
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE>. If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> now dies, you can at least attach
to it with <CODE>gdb</CODE> or use <CODE>gdb</CODE> on the core file to find out
what happened.

</P>
<P>
When you configure MySQL for debugging you automatically enable a
lot of extra safety check functions that monitor the health of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
If they find something ``unexpected,'' an entry will be written to
<CODE>stderr</CODE>, which <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> directs to the error log!  This also
means that if you are having some unexpected problems with MySQL and
are using a source distribution, the first thing you should do is to
configure MySQL for debugging!  (The second thing, of course, is to
send mail to a MySQL mailing list and ask for help.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
Please use the
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script for all bug reports or questions regarding the
MySQL version you are using!

</P>
<P>
In the Windows MySQL distribution, <CODE>mysqld.exe</CODE> is by
default compiled with support for trace files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Making_trace_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A></H3>

<P>
If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't start or if you can cause the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server to crash quickly, you can try to create a trace
file to find the problem.

</P>
<P>
To do this you have to have a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> that is compiled for debugging.
You can check this by executing <CODE>mysqld -V</CODE>.  If the version number
ends with <CODE>-debug</CODE>, it's compiled with support for trace files.

</P>
<P>
Start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with a trace log in <TT>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</TT>
(or <TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT> on Windows):

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld --debug</CODE>

</P>
<P>
On Windows you should also use the <CODE>--standalone</CODE> flag to not start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service:

</P>
<P>
In a console window do:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld --debug --standalone
</PRE>

<P>
After this you can use the <CODE>mysql.exe</CODE> command-line tool in a
second console window to reproduce the problem. You can take down the above
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the trace file will get <STRONG>very big</STRONG>!
If you want to have a smaller trace file, you can use something like:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld --debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace</CODE>

</P>
<P>
which only prints information with the most interesting tags in
<TT>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you make a bug report about this, please only send the lines from the
trace file to the appropriate mailing list where something seems to go
wrong! If you can't locate the wrong place, you can ftp the trace file,
together with a full bug report, to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a> so that a MySQL
developer can take a look a this.

</P>

<P>
On most systems you can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from <CODE>gdb</CODE> to get
more information if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes.

</P>
<P>
With some older <CODE>gdb</CODE> versions on Linux you must use <CODE>run
--one-thread</CODE> if you want to be able to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> threads.  In
this case you can only have one thread active at a time.  We recommend you
to upgrade to gdb 5.1 ASAP as thread debugging works much better with this
version!

</P>
<P>
When running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> under gdb, you should disable the stack trace
with <CODE>--skip-stack-trace</CODE> to be able to catch segfaults within gdb.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0.14 and above you should use the <CODE>--gdb</CODE> option to
mysqld.  This will install an interrupt handler for <CODE>SIGINT</CODE> (needed
to stop mysqld with <CODE>^C</CODE> to set breakpoints) and disable stack
tracing and core file handling.

</P>
<P>
It's very hard to debug MySQL under <CODE>gdb</CODE> if you do a lot of
new connections the whole time as <CODE>gdb</CODE> doesn't free the memory for
old threads.  You can avoid this problem by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O thread_cache_size= 'max_connections +1'</CODE>.  In most cases just
using <CODE>-O thread_cache_size=5'</CODE> will help a lot!

</P>
<P>
If you want to get a core dump on Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies with a
SIGSEGV signal, you can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option.
This core file can be used to make a backtrace that may help you
find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gdb mysqld core
gdb&#62;   backtrace full
gdb&#62;   exit
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

If you are using gdb 4.17.x or above on Linux, you should install a
<TT>`.gdb'</TT> file, with the following information, in your current
directory:

</P>

<PRE>
set print sevenbit off
handle SIGUSR1 nostop noprint
handle SIGUSR2 nostop noprint
handle SIGWAITING nostop noprint
handle SIGLWP nostop noprint
handle SIGPIPE nostop
handle SIGALRM nostop
handle SIGHUP nostop
handle SIGTERM nostop noprint
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems debugging threads with gdb, you should download
gdb 5.x and try this instead. The new gdb version has very improved
thread handling!

</P>
<P>
Here is an example how to debug mysqld:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gdb /usr/local/libexec/mysqld
gdb&#62; run

<P>
Include the above output in a mail generated with <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> and
mail this to the general MySQL mailing list.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mailing-list">1.6.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> hangs you can try to use some system tools like
<CODE>strace</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/proc/bin/pstack</CODE> to examine where
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> has hung.

you can find where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died by doing the following:

<OL>
<LI>

Copy the above numbers to a file, for example <TT>`mysqld.stack'</TT>.

<LI>

Make a symbol file for the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server:

<PRE>
nm -n libexec/mysqld &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

Note that most MySQL binary distributions (except for the "debug" packages,
where this information is included inside of the binaries themselves)
already ship with the above file, named <CODE>mysqld.sym.gz</CODE>.
In this case you can simply unpack it by doing:


<PRE>
gunzip &#60; bin/mysqld.sym.gz &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

<LI>

Execute <CODE>resolve_stack_dump -s /tmp/mysqld.sym -n mysqld.stack</CODE>.

This will print out where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died. If this doesn't help you
find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died, you should make a bug report and include
the output from the above command with the bug report.

Note however that in most cases it will not help us to just have a stack
trace to find the reason for the problem.  To be able to locate the bug
or provide a workaround, we would in most cases need to know the query
that killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and preferable a test case so that we can
repeat the problem!  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

the log file for the query that killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>--log</CODE> without a file name, the log is stored in
the database directory as 'hostname'.log In most cases it's the last
query in the log file that killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, but if possible you
should verify this by restarting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and executing the found
query from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tools. If this works, you
should also test all complicated queries that didn't complete.

</P>
<P>
You can also try the command <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> on all <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements that takes a long time to ensure that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is using
indexes properly. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can find the queries that take a long time to execute by starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you find the text <CODE>mysqld restarted</CODE> in the error log file
(normally named <TT>`hostname.err'</TT>) you have probably found a query
that causes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to fail.  If this happens you should check all
your tables with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>),
and test the queries in the MySQL log files to see if one doesn't
work.  If you find such a query, try first upgrading to the newest
MySQL version.  If this doesn't help and you can't find anything
in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> mail archive, you should report the bug to a MySQL
mailing list.
The mailing lists are described at
<a HREF="http://lists.mysql.com/">http://lists.mysql.com/</a>, which also has links to online
list archives.

</P>
<P>
If you have started <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>myisam-recover</CODE>,
MySQL will automatically check and try to repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables if they are marked as 'not closed properly' or 'crashed'.  If
this happens, MySQL will write an entry in the
<CODE>hostname.err</CODE> file <CODE>'Warning: Checking table ...'</CODE> which is
followed by <CODE>Warning: Repairing table</CODE> if the table needs to be
repaired.  If you get a lot of these errors, without <CODE>mysqld</CODE> having
died unexpectedly just before, then something is wrong and needs to
be investigated further. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
It's of course not a good sign if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> did died unexpectedly,
but in this case one shouldn't investigate the <CODE>Checking table...</CODE>
messages but instead try to find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Reproduceable_test_case" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case If You Experience Table Corruption</A></H3>

<P>
If you get corrupted tables or if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> always fails after some
update commands, you can test if this bug is reproducible by doing the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Take down the MySQL daemon (with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>).
<LI>

Make a backup of the tables (to guard against the very unlikely case that
the repair will do something bad).
<LI>

Check all tables with <CODE>myisamchk -s database/*.MYI</CODE>.  Repair any
wrong tables with <CODE>myisamchk -r database/table.MYI</CODE>.
<LI>

Make a second backup of the tables.
<LI>

Remove (or move away) any old log files from the MySQL data
directory if you need more space.
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.
If you want to find a query that crashes <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you should use
<CODE>--log --log-bin</CODE>.
<LI>

When you have gotten a crashed table, stop the <CODE>mysqld server</CODE>.
<LI>

Restore the backup.
<LI>

Restart the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server <STRONG>without</STRONG> <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>
<LI>

Re-execute the commands with <CODE>mysqlbinlog update-log-file | mysql</CODE>.
The update log is saved in the MySQL database directory with
the name <CODE>hostname-bin.#</CODE>.
<LI>

If the tables are corrupted again or you can get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to die with the
above command, you have found reproducible bug that should be easy to
fix! FTP the tables and the binary log to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a> and enter it into
our bugs system at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.
If you are a support customer), you can also <a HREF="mailto:support@mysql.com">support@mysql.com</a> to
alert the MySQL team about the problem and have it fixed as soon as possible.
</UL>

<P>
You can also use the script <CODE>mysql_find_rows</CODE> to just execute some of the
update statements if you want to narrow down the problem.

<H2><A NAME="Debugging_client" HREF="manual_toc.html#Debugging_client">E.2  Debugging a MySQL client</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2100"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2101"></A>

</P>
<P>
To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug package,
you should configure MySQL with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> or
<CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2102"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2103"></A>
Before running a client, you should set the <CODE>MYSQL_DEBUG</CODE> environment
variable:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
shell&#62; export MYSQL_DEBUG
</PRE>

<P>
This causes clients to generate a trace file in <TT>`/tmp/client.trace'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt to
connect to the server and run your query using a client that is known to
work.  Do this by running <CODE>mysql</CODE> in debugging mode (assuming you
have compiled MySQL with debugging on):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
</PRE>

<P>
This will provide useful information in case you mail a bug report.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should check
that your <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> include file matches your mysql library file.
A very common mistake is to use an old <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> file from an old
MySQL installation with new MySQL library.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="The_DBUG_package" HREF="manual_toc.html#The_DBUG_package">E.3  The DBUG Package</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2104"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server and most MySQL clients are compiled
with the DBUG package originally made by Fred Fish.  When one has configured
MySQL for debugging, this package makes it possible to get a trace
file of what the program is debugging. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
One uses the debug package by invoking the program with the
<CODE>--debug="..."</CODE> or the <CODE>-#...</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Most MySQL programs has a default debug string that will be
used if you don't specify an option to <CODE>--debug</CODE>.  The default
trace file is usually <CODE>/tmp/programname.trace</CODE> on Unix and
<CODE>\programname.trace</CODE> on Windows.

</P>
<P>
The debug control string is a sequence of colon-separated fields
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;field_1&#62;:&#60;field_2&#62;:...:&#60;field_N&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Each field consists of a mandatory flag character followed by
an optional "," and comma-separated list of modifiers:

</P>

<PRE>
flag[,modifier,modifier,...,modifier]
</PRE>

<P>
The currently recognised flag characters are:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Flag</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>d </TD><TD> Enable output from DBUG_&#60;N&#62; macros for the current state. May be followed by a list of keywords which selects output only for the DBUG macros with that keyword. An empty list of keywords implies output for all macros.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>D </TD><TD> Delay after each debugger output line. The argument is the number of tenths of seconds to delay, subject to machine capabilities. That is, <CODE>-#D,20</CODE> is delay two seconds.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>f </TD><TD> Limit debugging and/or tracing, and profiling to the list of named functions.  Note that a null list will disable all functions.   The appropriate "d" or "t" flags must still be given, this flag only limits their actions if they are enabled.

<H2><A NAME="Locking_methods" HREF="manual_toc.html#Locking_methods">E.4  Locking methods</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2106"></A>

</P>
<P>
Currently MySQL only supports table locking for
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables,
page-level locking for <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables and
row-level locking for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Internal_locking">5.3.1  How MySQL Locks Tables</A>.
With <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables one can freely mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> without locks, if the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements are non-conflicting
(that is, whenever they append to the end of the table file rather than
filling freespace from deleted rows/data).

</P>
<P>
Starting in version 3.23.33, you can analyse the table lock contention
on your system by checking <CODE>Table_locks_waited</CODE> and
<CODE>Table_locks_immediate</CODE> environment variables.

</P>
<P>
To decide if you want to use a table type with row-level locking,
you will want to look at what the application does and what the
select/update pattern of the data is.

</P>
<P>
Pros for row locking:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Fewer lock conflicts when accessing different rows in many threads.
<LI>

Fewer changes for rollbacks.
<LI>

Makes it possible to lock a single row a long time.
</UL>

<P>
Cons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Takes more memory than page level or table locks.
<LI>

Is slower than page level or table locks when used on a big part of the table,
because one has to do many more locks.
<LI>

Is definitely much worse than other locks if you do often do <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> on a large part of the data or if one has to often scan the whole table.
<LI>

With higher level locks one can also more easily support locks of
different types to tune the application as the lock overhead is less
notable as for row level locks.
</UL>

<P>
Table locks are superior to page level / row level locks in the
following cases:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mostly reads
<LI>

Read and updates on strict keys; this is where one updates or deletes
a row that can be fetched with one key read:

<PRE>
UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE unique_key#
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE unique_key=#
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> combined with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> (and very few <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements).
<LI>

Many scans / <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> on the whole table without any writers.
</UL>

<P>
Other options than row / page level locking:

</P>
<P>
Versioning (like we use in MySQL for concurrent inserts) where
you can have one writer at the same time as many readers.  This means
that the database/table supports different views for the data depending
on when one started to access it. Other names for this are time travel,
copy on write or copy on demand.

</P>
<P>
Copy on demand is in many case much better than page or row level
locking; the worst case does, however, use much more memory than
when using normal locks.

</P>
<P>
Instead of using row level locks one can use application level locks
(like get_lock/release_lock in MySQL).  This works of course
only in well-behaved applications.

</P>
<P>
In many cases one can do an educated guess which locking type is best
for the application, but generally it's very hard to say that a given
lock type is better than another; everything depends on the application
and different part of the application may require different lock types.

</P>
<P>
Here are some tips about locking in MySQL:

</P>
<P>
Most web applications do lots of selects, very few
deletes, updates mainly on keys, and inserts in some specific tables.
The base MySQL setup is very well tuned for this.

</P>
<P>
Concurrent users are not a problem if one doesn't mix updates with selects
that need to examine many rows in the same table.

</P>
<P>
If one mixes inserts and deletes on the same table then <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
may be of great help.

</P>
<P>
One can also use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> to speed up things (many updates within
a single lock is much faster than updates without locks).  Splitting
thing to different tables will also help.

</P>
<P>
If you get speed problems with the table locks in MySQL, you
may be able to solve these by converting some of your tables to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
or <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.6  <CODE>BDB</CODE> or <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>

The optimisation section in the manual covers a lot of different aspects of
how to tune applications. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Tips">5.2.13  Other Optimisation Tips</A>.

<H2><A NAME="RTS-threads" HREF="manual_toc.html#RTS-threads">E.5  Comments about RTS threads</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2107"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2108"></A>

</P>
<P>
I have tried to use the RTS thread packages with MySQL but
stumbled on the following problems:

</P>
<P>
They use an old version of a lot of POSIX calls and it is very tedious to
make wrappers for all functions. I am inclined to think that it would
be easier to change the thread libraries to the newest POSIX
specification.

</P>
<P>
Some wrappers are already written. See <TT>`mysys/my_pthread.c'</TT> for more info.

</P>
<P>
At least the following should be changed:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>pthread_get_specific</CODE> should use one argument.
<CODE>sigwait</CODE> should take two arguments.
A lot of functions (at least <CODE>pthread_cond_wait</CODE>,
<CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait</CODE>)
should return the error code on error. Now they return -1 and set <CODE>errno</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another problem is that user-level threads use the <CODE>ALRM</CODE> signal and this
aborts a lot of functions (<CODE>read</CODE>, <CODE>write</CODE>, <CODE>open</CODE>...).
MySQL should do a retry on interrupt on all of these but it is
not that easy to verify it.

</P>
<P>
The biggest unsolved problem is the following:

</P>
<P>
To get thread-level alarms I changed <TT>`mysys/thr_alarm.c'</TT> to wait between
alarms with <CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait()</CODE>, but this aborts with error
<CODE>EINTR</CODE>.  I tried to debug the thread library as to why this happens,
but couldn't find any easy solution.

</P>
<P>
If someone wants to try MySQL with RTS threads I suggest the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Change functions MySQL uses from the thread library to POSIX.
This shouldn't take that long.
<LI>

Compile all libraries with the <CODE>-DHAVE_rts_threads</CODE>.
<LI>

Compile <CODE>thr_alarm</CODE>.
<LI>

If there are some small differences in the implementation, they may be fixed
by changing <TT>`my_pthread.h'</TT> and <TT>`my_pthread.c'</TT>.
<LI>

Run <CODE>thr_alarm</CODE>. If it runs without any ``warning'', ``error'' or aborted
messages, you are on the right track. Here is a successful run on
Solaris:

<H2><A NAME="Thread_packages" HREF="manual_toc.html#Thread_packages">E.6  Differences between different thread packages</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2109"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL is very dependent on the thread package used. So when
choosing a good platform for MySQL, the thread package is very
important.

</P>
<P>
There are at least three types of thread packages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User threads in a single process. Thread switching is managed with
alarms and the threads library manages all non-thread-safe functions
with locks. Read, write and select operations are usually managed with a
thread-specific select that switches to another thread if the running
threads have to wait for data.  If the user thread packages are
integrated in the standard libs (FreeBSD and BSDI threads) the thread
package requires less overhead than thread packages that have to map all
unsafe calls (MIT-pthreads, FSU Pthreads and RTS threads).  In some
environments (for example, SCO), all system calls are thread-safe so the
mapping can be done very easily (FSU Pthreads on SCO).  Downside: All
mapped calls take a little time and it's quite tricky to be able to
handle all situations. There are usually also some system calls that are
not handled by the thread package (like MIT-pthreads and sockets). Thread
scheduling isn't always optimal.
<LI>

User threads in separate processes. Thread switching is done by the
kernel and all data are shared between threads.  The thread package
manages the standard thread calls to allow sharing data between threads.
LinuxThreads is using this method.  Downside: Lots of processes. Thread
creating is slow. If one thread dies the rest are usually left hanging
and you must kill them all before restarting. Thread switching is
somewhat expensive.
<LI>

Kernel threads. Thread switching is handled by the thread library or the
kernel and is very fast. Everything is done in one process, but on some
systems, <CODE>ps</CODE> may show the different threads. If one thread aborts, the
whole process aborts. Most system calls are thread-safe and should
require very little overhead.  Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and OSF/1 have kernel
threads.
</UL>

<P>
In some systems kernel threads are managed by integrating user
level threads in the system libraries. In such cases, the thread
switching can only be done by the thread library and the kernel isn't
really ``thread aware''.

</P>

Here is a list of all the environment variables that are used directly or
indirectly by MySQL. Most of these can also be found in other

<P>
Note that any options on the command-line take precedence over
values specified in configuration files and environment variables, and
values in configuration files take precedence over values in environment

</P>
<P>
A regular expression (regex) is a powerful way of specifying a complex search.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses Henry Spencer's implementation of regular
expressions, which is aimed at conformance with POSIX
1003.2. MySQL uses the extended version.

</P>
<P>
This is a simplistic reference that skips the details. To get more exact
information, see Henry Spencer's <CODE>regex(7)</CODE> manual page that is
included in the source distribution. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Credits">C  Credits</A>.

</P>
<P>
A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest regexp is
one that has no special characters in it. For example, the regexp
<CODE>hello</CODE> matches <CODE>hello</CODE> and nothing else.

</P>
<P>
Non-trivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that
they can match more than one string. For example, the regexp
<CODE>hello|word</CODE> matches either the string <CODE>hello</CODE> or the string
<CODE>word</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As a more complex example, the regexp <CODE>B[an]*s</CODE> matches any of the
strings <CODE>Bananas</CODE>, <CODE>Baaaaas</CODE>, <CODE>Bs</CODE>, and any other string
starting with a <CODE>B</CODE>, ending with an <CODE>s</CODE>, and containing any
number of <CODE>a</CODE> or <CODE>n</CODE> characters in between.

</P>
<P>
A regular expression may use any of the following special
characters/constructs:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>^</CODE>
<DD>
Match the beginning of a string.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "fo\nfo" REGEXP "^fo$";           -&#62; 0

mysql&#62; SELECT "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba+n";              -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>a?</CODE>

</PRE>

<DT><CODE>{1}</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>{2,3}</CODE>
<DD>
The is a more general way of writing regexps that match many
occurrences of the previous atom.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>a*</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{0,}</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>a+</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{1,}</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>a?</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{0,1}</CODE>.
</DL>
To be more precise, an atom followed by a bound containing one integer
<CODE>i</CODE> and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <CODE>i</CODE> matches of
the atom. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <CODE>i</CODE>
and a comma matches a sequence of <CODE>i</CODE> or more matches of the atom.
An atom followed by a bound containing two integers <CODE>i</CODE> and
<CODE>j</CODE> matches a sequence of <CODE>i</CODE> through <CODE>j</CODE> (inclusive)
matches of the atom.

Both arguments must be in the range from <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>RE_DUP_MAX</CODE>
(default 255), inclusive.  If there are two arguments, the second must be
greater than or equal to the first.
<DT><CODE>[a-dX]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>[^a-dX]</CODE>
<DD>
Matches
any character which is (or is not, if ^ is used) either <CODE>a</CODE>, <CODE>b</CODE>,
<CODE>c</CODE>, <CODE>d</CODE> or <CODE>X</CODE>. To include a literal <CODE>]</CODE> character,
it must immediately follow the opening bracket <CODE>[</CODE>.  To include a
literal <CODE>-</CODE> character, it must be written first or last. So
<CODE>[0-9]</CODE> matches any decimal digit. Any character that does not have
a defined meaning inside a <CODE>[]</CODE> pair has no special meaning and
matches only itself.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "[a-dXYZ]";         -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]$";       -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]+$";      -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";     -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "gheis" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";    -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "gheisa" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";   -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>[[.characters.]]</CODE>
<DD>
The sequence of characters of that collating element. The sequence is a
single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket expression
containing a multi-character collating element can thus match more than
one character, for example, if the collating sequence includes a <CODE>ch</CODE>
collating element, then the regular expression <CODE>[[.ch.]]*c</CODE> matches the
first five characters of <CODE>chchcc</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>[=character_class=]</CODE>
<DD>
An equivalence class, standing for the sequences of characters of all
collating elements equivalent to that one, including itself.

For example, if <CODE>o</CODE> and <CODE>(+)</CODE> are the members of an
equivalence class, then <CODE>[[=o=]]</CODE>, <CODE>[[=(+)=]]</CODE>, and
<CODE>[o(+)]</CODE> are all synonymous. An equivalence class may not be an
endpoint of a range.

<DT><CODE>[:character_class:]</CODE>
<DD>
Within a bracket expression, the name of a character class enclosed in
<CODE>[:</CODE> and <CODE>:]</CODE> stands for the list of all characters belonging
to that class. Standard character class names are:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Name</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>alnum </TD><TD> digit </TD><TD> punct

<TR><TD>blank </TD><TD> lower </TD><TD> upper
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>cntrl </TD><TD> print </TD><TD> xdigit
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

These stand for the character classes defined in the <CODE>ctype(3)</CODE> manual
page. A locale may provide others. A character class may not be used as an
endpoint of a range.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "justalnums" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";       -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "!!" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";               -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>[[:&#60;:]]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>[[:&#62;:]]</CODE>
<DD>
These match the null string at the beginning and end of a word
respectively.  A word is defined as a sequence of word characters which
is neither preceded nor followed by word characters. A word character is
an alnum character (as defined by <CODE>ctype(3)</CODE>) or an underscore
(<CODE>_</CODE>).

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "a word a" REGEXP "[[:&#60;:]]word[[:&#62;:]]";      -&#62; 1

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>


<H2>13.4  Preamble</H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</P>

<H2>13.5  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



<P><STRONG>13.6  NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>

<LI>

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<LI>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</OL>


<H2>13.7  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H2>


<H2>13.8  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</H2>

<P>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

</P>
<P>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

</P>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
version number 2.1.]
</PRE>


<H2>13.9  Preamble</H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

</P>
<P>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</P>
<P>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

</P>
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

</P>
<P>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

</P>
<P>
  We call this license the <STRONG>Lesser</STRONG> General Public License because it
does <EM>Less</EM> to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

</P>
<P>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

</P>
<P>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

</P>
<P>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
``work based on the library'' and a ``work that uses the library''.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

</P>

<H2>13.10  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Lesser General Public License (also called ``this License'').  Each
licensee is addressed as ``you''.

  A ``library'' means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The ``Library'', below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A ``work based on the
Library'' means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ``modification''.)

  ``Source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

The modified work must itself be a software library.

<LI>

You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ``work that uses the Library''.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ``work that uses the
library''.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a ``work that uses the Library'' uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether they are linked directly with the Library itself.

<LI>

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ``work that
uses the Library'', as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

<LI>

Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at runtime a copy of the
library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
version that the work was made with.

<LI>

Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

<LI>

If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

<LI>

Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</OL>

  For an executable, the required form of the ``work that uses the
Library'' must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

<LI>

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

<LI>

Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</OL>

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
``any later version'', you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

</P>

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
