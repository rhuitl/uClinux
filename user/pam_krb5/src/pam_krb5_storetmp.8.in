.SH NAME
@SECURITYDIR@/@PACKAGE@/pam_krb5_storetmp \- Temporary file helper

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam_krb5_storetmp pattern [uid] [gid]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The pam_krb5.so module uses pam_krb5_storetmp to create and remove temporary
files.  It is not intended for any other use.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP pattern
A filename pattern of the form \fI@default_ccache_dir@/fooXXXXXX\fR.  A
temporary file will be created using mkstemp(3) and any data provided to
standard input will be piped to the file.  Upon reading an end-of-file, the
helper will print the name of the created file.
.br
If the pattern does not end with the distinctive patterh \fIXXXXXX\fR, then
the file is simply deleted.

.IP uid
An optional numeric UID which the helper will attempt to switch to before
creating the file.  The helper continues in its task if the attempt fails.

.IP gid
An optional numeric GID which the helper will attempt to switch to before
creating the file.  The helper continues in its task if the attempt fails.
