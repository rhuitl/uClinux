.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I mini_httpd
is a small HTTP server.
Its performance is not great, but for low or medium traffic sites it's
quite adequate.
It implements all the basic features of an HTTP server, including:
.TP 3
*
GET, HEAD, and POST methods.
.TP 3
*
CGI.
.TP 3
*
Basic authentication.
.TP 3
*
Security against ".." filename snooping.
.TP 3
*
The common MIME types.
.TP 3
*
Trailing-slash redirection.
.TP 3
*
index.html, index.htm, index.cgi
.TP 3
*
Directory listings.
.TP 3
*
Multihoming / virtual hosting.
.TP 3
*
Standard logging.
.TP 3
*
Custom error pages.
.PP
It can also be configured to do SSL/HTTPS.
.PP
mini_httpd was written for a couple reasons.
One, as an experiment to see just how slow an old-fashioned forking
web server would be with today's operating systems.
The answer is, surprisingly, not that slow - on FreeBSD 3.2, mini_httpd
benchmarks at about 90% the speed of Apache.
The other main reason for writing mini_httpd was to get a simple
platform for experimenting with new web server technology, for instance SSL.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -p
Specifies an alternate port number to listen on.
The default is 80.
.TP
.B -c
Specifies a wildcard pattern for CGI programs, for instance "**.cgi"
or "/cgi-bin/*".
The default is no CGI.
.TP
.B -u
Specifies what user to switch to after initialization when started as root.
The default is "nobody".
.TP
.B -h
Specifies a hostname to bind to, for multihoming.
The default is to bind to all hostnames supported on the local machine.
.TP
.B -r
Do a chroot() at initialization time, restricting file access
to the program's current directory.
See below for details.
.TP
.B -v
Do virtual hosting.
.TP
.B -l
Specifies a log file name.
The default is no logging.
.TP
.B -i
Specifies a file to write the process-id to.
If no file is specified, no process-id is written.
You can use this file to send signals to mini_httpd.
.TP
.B -T
Specifies the character set to use with text MIME types.
The default is iso-8859-1.
.TP
.B -S
If mini_httpd is configured to do SSL/HTTPS, then the -S flag is available
to enable this feature.
.TP
.B -D
This was originally just a debugging flag, however it's worth mentioning
because one of the things it does is prevent mini_httpd from making itself
a background daemon.
Instead it runs in the foreground like a regular program.
This is necessary when you want to run mini_httpd wrapped in a little shell
script that restarts it if it exits.
.SH "CGI"
.PP
mini_httpd supports the CGI 1.1 spec.
.PP
In order for a CGI program to be run, its name must match the pattern
you specify with the -c flag
This is a simple shell-style filename pattern.
You can use * to match any string not including a slash,
or ** to match any string including slashes,
or ? to match any single character.
You can also use multiple such patterns separated by |.
The patterns get checked against the filename
part of the incoming URL.
Don't forget to quote any wildcard characters so that the shell doesn't
mess with them.
.SH "BASIC AUTHENTICATION"
.PP
Basic Authentication uses a password file called ".htpasswd", in
the directory to be protected.
This file is formatted as the familiar colon-separated
username/encrypted-password pair, records delimited by newlines.
The protection does not carry over to subdirectories.
The utility program htpasswd(1) is included to help create and
modify .htpasswd files.
.SH "CHROOT"
.PP
chroot() is a system call that restricts the program's view
of the filesystem to the current directory and directories
below it.
It becomes impossible for remote users to access any file
outside of the initial directory.
The restriction is inherited by child processes, so CGI programs get it too.
This is a very strong security measure, and is recommended.
The only downside is that only root can call chroot(), so this means
the program must be started as root.
However, the last thing it does during initialization is to
give up root access by becoming another user, so this is safe.
.PP
Note that with some other web servers, such as NCSA httpd, setting
up a directory tree for use with chroot() is complicated, involving
creating a bunch of special directories and copying in various files.
With mini_httpd it's a lot easier, all you have to do is make sure
any shells, utilities, and config files used by your CGI programs and
scripts are available.
If you have CGI disabled, or if you make a policy that all CGI programs
must be written in a compiled language such as C and statically linked,
then you probably don't have to do any setup at all.
.SH "MULTIHOMING"
.PP
Multihoming means using one machine to serve multiple hostnames.
For instance, if you're an internet provider and you want to let
all of your customers have customized web addresses, you might
have www.joe.acme.com, www.jane.acme.com, and your own www.acme.com,
all running on the same physical hardware.
This feature is also known as "virtual hosts".
There are three steps to setting this up.
.PP
One, make DNS entries for all of the hostnames.
The current way to do this, allowed by HTTP/1.1, is to use CNAME aliases,
like so:
.nf
  www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1
  www.joe.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
  www.jane.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
.fi
However, this is incompatible with older HTTP/1.0 browsers.
If you want to stay compatible, there's a different way - use A records
instead, each with a different IP address, like so:
.nf
  www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1
  www.joe.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.200
  www.jane.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.201
.fi
This is bad because it uses extra IP addresses, a somewhat scarce resource.
But if you want people with older browsers to be able to visit your
sites, you still have to do it this way.
.PP
Step two.
If you're using the modern CNAME method of multihoming, then you can
skip this step.
Otherwise, using the older multiple-IP-address method you
must set up IP aliases or multiple interfaces for the extra addresses.
You can use ifconfig(8)'s alias command to tell the machine to answer to
all of the different IP addresses.
Example:
.nf
  ifconfig le0 www.acme.com
  ifconfig le0 www.joe.acme.com alias
  ifconfig le0 www.jane.acme.com alias
.fi
If your OS's version of ifconfig doesn't have an alias command, you're
probably out of luck.
.PP
Third and last, you must set up mini_httpd to handle the multiple hosts.
The easiest way is with the -v flag.
This works with either CNAME multihosting or multiple-IP multihosting.
What it does is send each incoming request to a subdirectory based on the
hostname it's intended for.
All you have to do in order to set things up is to create those subdirectories
in the directory where mini_httpd will run.
With the example above, you'd do like so:
.nf
  mkdir www.acme.com www.joe.acme.com www.jane.acme.com
.fi
If you're using old-style multiple-IP multihosting, you should also create
symbolic links from the numeric addresses to the names, like so:
.nf
  ln -s www.acme.com 192.100.66.1
  ln -s www.joe.acme.com 192.100.66.200
  ln -s www.jane.acme.com 192.100.66.201
.fi
This lets the older HTTP/1.0 browsers find the right subdirectory.
.PP
There's an optional alternate step three if you're using multiple-IP
multihosting: run a separate mini_httpd process for each hostname, using
the -h flag to specify which one is which.
This gives you more flexibility, since you can run each of these processes
in separate directories or with different options.
Example:
.nf
  ( cd /usr/www ; mini_httpd -h www.acme.com )
  ( cd /usr/www/joe ; mini_httpd -u joe -h www.joe.acme.com )
  ( cd /usr/www/jane ; mini_httpd -u jane -h www.jane.acme.com )
.fi
But remember, this multiple-process method does not work with CNAME
multihosting - for that, you must use a single mini_httpd process with
the -v flag.
.SH "CUSTOM ERRORS"
.PP 
mini_httpd lets you define your own custom error pages for the various
HTTP errors.
There's a separate file for each error number, all stored in one
special directory.
The directory name is "errors", at the top of the web directory tree.
The error files should be named "errNNN.html", where NNN is the error number.
So for example, to make a custom error page for the authentication failure
error, which is number 401, you would put your HTML into the file
"errors/err401.html".
If no custom error file is found for a given error number, then the
usual built-in error page is generated.
.PP 
If you're using the virtual hosts option, you can also have different
custom error pages for each different virtual host.
In this case you put another "errors" directory in the top of that
virtual host's web tree.
mini_httpd will look first in the virtual host errors directory, and
then in the server-wide errors directory, and if neither of those
has an appropriate error file then it will generate the built-in error.
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
mini_httpd will terminate cleanly upon receipt of a number of different
signals, which you can send via the standard Unix kill(1) command.
Any of SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP, or SIGUSR1 will do the trick.
All requests in progress will be completed.
The network socket used to accept new connections gets
closed immediately, which means a fresh mini_httpd can be started up
right away.
This is convenient when you're rotating your log files.
.SH CERTIFICATES
.PP
If you're going to serve SSL/HTTPS you will need a server certificate.
There are a bunch of companies that will issue one for you; see the
lists at http://www.apache-ssl.org/#Digital_Certificates and
http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.4/ssl_faq.html#ToC23
.PP
You can also create one for yourself, using the openssl tool.
Step one - create the key and certificate request:
.nf
    openssl req -new > cert.csr
.fi
Step two - remove the passphrase from the key:
.nf
    openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out key.pem
.fi
Step three - convert the certificate request into a signed certificate:
.nf
    openssl x509 -in cert.csr -out cert.pem -req -signkey key.pem -days 365
.fi
This creates four files.
The ones you want are cert.pem and key.pem.
You don't need cert.csr and privkey.pem, and may remove them.
