1.10:
  have fallback in case sendfile fails

1.9:
  chdir to cgi's base dir (Kuba Winnicki)
  set HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING environment variable (Kuba Winnicki)
    We actually should export all HTTP headers as HTTP_[header]
    Any takers?
  Try not to send error message HTTP headers if we already sent the
    headers from the CGI (Kuba Winnicki)
  <ims -> <=ims (Gerrit Pape)
  64-bit file I/O cleanliness
  fix HTTP ranges (Joachim Berdal Haga via Gerrit Pape)

1.8a:
  Steve Bennett <steveb@snapgear.com>
  -----------------------------------
  Raise SIGINT, not SIGQUIT if execv fails
    otherwise we will get a nasty core dump message.
  Add support for configuring the fnord web server as an alternative to boa
  If logging is configured (at compile time), fnord now takes a -l flag to turn it on.
  The full url, including cgi args is given in the log.
  Don't die with content type but no content length
  Make sure PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED are set correctly.
  Only add index.html with a trailing slash if not executing a CGI script
  Be more liberal in accepting byte ranges greater than the size of the file.
    Just return everything we have in this case.
  Implement the "virtual path" feature for cgis.
    This is where the url can request a virtual path past the cgi executable.
  Move into the uClinux build system
  Add basic auth support, mostly taken directly from boa/src/auth.c
  Add support for different index.cgi
  Turn off use of mmap()
  When using auth, REMOTE_USER is available to cgi
  Request logging can be stderr, syslog or nothing - set at compile time.
  Move large buffers off the stack to minimise stack usage
  Fix a few compiler warnings
  Allow the default dir to be specified at compile time

1.8:
  keep current environment in CGI (Laurent Bercot)
  make fnord-conf use the UID and not the user name (Fridtjof Busse)
  fix typo in buffer_putulonglong (Gerrit Pape)
  fix CGI POST off-by-two typo (Mark Hopf)
  fix gif->png conversion (Thomas Seck)
  remove == bashism from fnord-conf (Thomas Seck)
  add bittorrent mime type
  make authorization data available to CGIs for GET, too (Paul Jarc)
  fix conversion of host name to lower case (Gerrit Pape)
  add small test cgi: cgi-post.c
  fix CGI POST bug (Moe Wibble)
  fix CGI PATH_TRANSLATED bug (Nicolas George)
  add optional authentication support (Nicolas George, see README.auth)
  make sure error messages are text/html
  move /. -> /: conversion before demangling so it can actually be
    used as security measure for installations that don't use chroot

1.7:
  add .mov and .qt for quicktime, .mpg for video/mpeg and .wav for audio/x-wav
  add mmap based file serving (should do zero-copy tcp just like sendfile)
  add Pragma: no-cache to CGI responses
  fix (apparently not exploitable) buffer overrun in do_cgi
    This bug was found by Ralf Wildenhues.  To my knowledge it is
    impossible to exploit this bug on any platform known to me.
  fix (harmless) access to uninitialized data

1.6:
  add support for $PATH_INFO in CGI environment.
  add .pac for netscape proxy autoconfig
  add .sig for application/pgp-signature

1.5:
  fix write timeout handling (found by Lukas Beeler)
  fix fnord-conf to use the symbolic account name in run script
    (Sebastian D.B. Krause)

1.4:
  add dangling symlink based whole-host redirection (see README).  This
    has the advantage that it can serve normal sites and redirect sites
    on the same IP.
  add support for non-TCP UCSPI environments (like ucspi-ssl).  Please
    get the latest version of my ucspi-tcp IPv6 patch as I violated the
    UCSPI spec with all versions before 0.88-diff11.
  change logging from "127.0.0.1 200 23 Links_(0.96;_Unix) none /index.html"
    to "127.0.0.1 200 23 localhost Links_(0.96;_Unix) none /index.html"
    (i.e. include the Host: header).  Suggested by Thomas Bader.
  add "immediate mode".  If you give fnord a command line argument, it
    will change to that directory and if no "default" directory is
    given, it will assume there are no virtual hosts and serve from the
    current directory.  I have a shell script called "http" that does
      tcpserver -RHl localhost 0 8000 /home/leitner/bin/fnord-idx .
    to share some directory on my hard drive with some poor Windows
    users without npoll (http://www.fefe.de/ncp/).  fnord-idx is a new
    target (a fnord with DIR_LIST) that is auto-built by make.

1.3:
  make directory listings use non-proportional fonts (thanks, Antonio Dias)
  fnord will now optionally (default: enabled) normalize the incoming
    host name, i.e. "www.domain.com" -> "www.domain.com:80".  That
    should cut down on the number of symbolic links. ;)
  remove timeout error message.  fnord will not drop the connection
    without error message.  Mozilla used to display the error message
    when the user caused another request on the connection with the
    timeout.
  Uwe Ohse found two more compilation problems.

1.2:
  Olaf: I changed my initial CGI-interface to NOT use the filesystem but
    two pipes.
  Add whole-host redirect (see README)
  Olaf: added direcory-lists and "index.cgi" support (normal CGI only !
    "nph-index.cgi" is not supported). Fixed some problematic parts in the
    CGI-interface (\n -> \r\n converter for http-header and CGI crash
    handling)
  Fix gzip encoding bug that only happened with keep-alive

1.1:
  ship with the parts from libowfat that we actually use
  minor speed-up.  sendfile is a drag for very small files, so those are
    now sent through the same buffer the header is sent through.  That
    sends the whole answer in one TCP packet if you are lucky, even
    without the TCP_CORK magic from Linux.  Major speed-up for
    benchmarks ;)

1.0:
  initial release
